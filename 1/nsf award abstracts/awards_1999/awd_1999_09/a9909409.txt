The Informal Science Education Program has been supporting
              the radio series "Living on Earth" for several years.   The World Media
              Foundation is now adding environmental science and technology features to
              "Living on Earth" and is developing and testing an outreach component that will
              involve youth as researchers and radio producers.   The science and technology
              features, ranging in length from four to twenty-four minutes, will depart from
              the usual news-driven reports on the programs.  Many of the segments will
              illustrate basic building blocks of environmental science, technology and
              related mathematics.  Others will profile diverse pioneers in these
              disciplines.  

The radio programs will be the framework for an
              interdisciplinary exploration program for youth.  Working with a team of
              educators from the Antioch University Graduate Program in Environmental
              Education, the project staff will develop a program in which secondary school
              aged youth cooperate with peers to produce professional, concise reporting on
              local environmental issues.  Living on Earth will feature the best of the
              student work on National Public Radio and highlight these pieces as an expanded
              feature on its website.
