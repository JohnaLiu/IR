The principal objectives of this study are to determine the
              eruption rates and emplacement mechanisms for the flows of the Sentinel Bluffs
              Member, Grande Ronde Basalt.  The size and extent of the youngest flows of the
              Columbia River Basalt Group are well established because of their distinct
              properties, but little is known about the most voluminous formation, the Grande
              Ronde Basalt, which consists of over 149,000 km3 of basalt that was erupted in
              a little over 1 million years.  This study will use a large existing database
              of stratigraphic sections and borehole data, lithologies, chemical compositions
              and magnetic polarities supplemented with new stratigraphic and chemical data
              to meet these objectives.  The data will first be used to refine the
              stratigraphy of the Sentinel Bluffs Member and determine the extent and volume
              of the flows.  Once a well-defined stratigraphy is established, compositional
              variations through the flows will be compared to intraflow structures.  This
              technique has been used previously to determine flow emplacement mechanisms,
              and to constrain eruption rates.  The volume of the flows coupled with the
              compositional variations also will provide new constraints on petrogenetic
              models for the Grande Ronde Basalt.  In addition, the size of the flows and
              their eruption rates will provide new insights into the impact these huge
              eruptions had on the Miocene climate.
