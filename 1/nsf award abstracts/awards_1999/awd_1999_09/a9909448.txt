Assessing the pace of a rapid climate transition: the Late Paleocene thermal
              maximum

Abstract

	Seafloor sediments from about 55 million years ago
              document a climate transition involving extreme warming of oceanic and
              continental temperatures and changes in global weather patterns. This event is
              associated with a dramatic change in the global carbon cycle and is synchronous
              with significant species extinctions and diversification. 
It is also thought
              to have been extremely rapid, occurring over just a few thousand years.
              
Although the cause of  the climate transition is unknown, its apparent
              rapidity places tight constraints on allowable mechanisms. For example, a
              leading candidate is catastrophic release of methane hydrate from sediments to
              the atmosphere, promoting greenhouse warming. However, the rapidity of the
              climate change has been the subject of debate because the rate estimates are
              based on poorly constrained sedimentation models. The goal of this proposal is
              to better define the sedimentation history during this climate event by using
              the accumulation of cosmic dust particles as a proxy for sedimentation rate.
              Over short intervals the accretion rate of cosmic dust from space should be
              nearly constant, so the concentration of cosmic dust in sediments will be
              governed by dilution with sediment. By using 3He as a proxy of the cosmic dust
              concentration, the sedimentation history during this climate excursion will be
              determined from several Ocean drilling Program cores. This information will be
              used to better distinguish among possible causes of the climate transition.
