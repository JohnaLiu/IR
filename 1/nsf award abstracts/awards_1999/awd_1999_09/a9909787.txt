This U.S.-Czech project between Robert Tribble of
              the Texas A&M Cyclotron Institute and Vaclav Burjan and Vaclav Kroha of the
              Nuclear Physics Institute of the Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic, features
              application of an indirect technique to determine direct resonance capture
              rates for reactions with radioactive nuclei.  Their technique for determining
              astrophysical S-factors works well for systems where the binding energy of the
              captured particle is small.  A capture cross section is determined by the
              normalization constant that connects the Coulomb shape of the overlap integral
              outside the nuclear radius to the nuclear interior.  Peripheral nuclear
              transfer reactions are then used to measure this normalization constant.  This
              new technique will be used by the US-Czech research team to determine the
              direct capture contribution for a number of capture reactions that are
              important in the hydrogen-burning phase of stellar evolution.  If successful,
              the technique may prove useful in interpreting available solar neutrino data,
              which in turn could provide new insights applicable to weak-interaction
              physics.

This project in nuclear astrophysics fulfills the program objective
              of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and
              Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence.

Partial funding for this
              project was provided by the Stellar Astronomy and Astrophysics Program of the
              NSF Division of Astronomical Sciences.
