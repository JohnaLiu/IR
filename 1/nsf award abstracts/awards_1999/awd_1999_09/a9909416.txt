Abstract    :
              This project targets high energy, short lived, reactive molecules for study. 
              The molecules of interest are generated in solution by photolysis of synthetic
              precursors and the stable products of their chemical reactions identified. 
              These reactive molecules will also be generated by short intense bursts of
              laser radiation and they will be detected by ultraviolet-visible or infrared
              spectroscopy.  In solid argon at 14K, the otherwise transient molecules are
              persistent and thus can be characterized by high resolution infrared
              spectroscopy.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program continues support for the research of Professor Matthew S. Platz of
              Ohio State University.  Professor Platz creates and studies interesting highly
              reactive and short-lived molecules.  Although such molecules are of basic
              scientific interest, they have much practical value in making larger molecules.
               They are also used by biochemists to attach small probe molecules to larger
              ones such as proteins, by materials scientists and in industry as photoresists
              and in lithography.  Students working on this project will be educated to
              become problem solvers who will eventually apply their skills to solving
              problems in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries and in academe.
