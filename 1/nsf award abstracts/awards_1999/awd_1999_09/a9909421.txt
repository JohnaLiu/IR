A full orogenic cycle, from immature islandarcs to
              accretion to stabilization of crust commonly involves multiple deformational
              events.  One of the challenges of structural and metamorphic analysis is to
              deconvolute the overprinting effects and deduce the crustal setting and history
              of ancient mountain belts.  Absolute timing constraints are critical for
              interpreting the significance of structures and metamorphic assemblages,
              however due to costs are often a limiting factor in tectonic studies.  This
              proposal is to apply the techniques of electron microprobe chemical dating and
              age mapping to the Proterozoic orogenic belt of southwestern North America,
              with the goal being to integrate geochronology into routine petrologic and
              structural analysis, and simultaneously to provide a new resolution on the
              pressure-temperature-time-deformation history of this important orogen. 
              Results are expected to refine the technique as well as shed light on accretion
              and stabilization events in the proterozoic of southwestern US.
