              ABSTRACT

OCE-9909875


The project director of this activity will organize
              a number of U.S. colleagues for the formation and first meeting of a U.S.
              Steering Committee for the Surface Ocean-Lower Atmosphere Study (SOLAS), a
              proposed international study of ocean/atmospheric biogeochemical coupling.  
              SOLAS is being designed by an international scientific committee of experts to
              address key interactions among the marine biogeochemical system, atmospheric
              chemistry, and climate and how the marine and atmospheric biogeochemical system
              affects and is affected by past, present, and future climate as well as other
              environmental changes. Six  scientists will participate as Scientific Steering
              Committee members to develop the initial trajectories of a U.S. program.  These
              six plus six other experts will receive travel assistance to participate in the
              international SOLAS Open Science Meeting in Kiel, Germany, 20-24 February,
              2000.
