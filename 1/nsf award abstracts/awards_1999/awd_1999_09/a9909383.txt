The Middle Triassic Latemar Limestone
              (Italy), a thick succession of hundreds of meter-scale shallow marine
              depositional cycles, is unique in that to date it is the only cyclic
              sedimentary deposit that has been intensively analyzed for Milankovitch forcing
              (Hinnov & Golldhammer, 1991) as well as radiometrically dated (indirectly)
              using the zircon single crystal technique on volcanoclastic interbeds in the
              coeval basinal deposits (mundil et al. 1996).  Unfortunately, the published
              results of the two methods as applied to the Latemar Limestone are in serious
              conflict (Brack et al. 1996; Hardie & Hinnov 1997).  In essence, the zircon
              dates have been interpreted to indicate that the Latemar cyclic succession was
              deposited in 2-4 m.y. whereas the cyclostratigraphic analysis indicates a
              Milankovitch origin which implies deposition over a ca. 10-12 m.y. period. 
              These conflicting results present a serious dilemma that goes well beyond the
              Latemar problem in view of the fact that both zircon single crystal and
              cyclostratigraphic methods have come to be widely applied in
              chronostratigraphic studies.  In an effort to resolve the problem, PIs propose
              to (1) re-examine the Latemar cyclostratigraphy for Milankovitch forcing using
              the latest time series modelling and analysis techniques, and (2) determine
              U/Pb ages of zircon crystals from volcanoclastic interbeds, the source
              ignimbrites, and the Predazzo granite that cuts trhough the Latemar massif. 
              The important new approach PIs will bring to the zircon dating will be
              pre-screening of the zircons using CL and BSE imaging techniques (Hanchar &
              Miller, 1995) and the dating of microslices of selected parts of single zircon
              crystals.  It is their hope that this proposed new study of the "Latemar
              controversy" will function as an important test case for high resolution dating
              of cyuclic sedimentary successions.
