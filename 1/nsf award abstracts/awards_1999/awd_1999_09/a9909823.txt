MILI

The Industry/University Cooperative Reseach
              Center (I/UCRC) for Software Engineering at Purdue University is adding the
              West Virginia University as a research site.

The I/UCRC's research agenda
              addresses:  1.) Reliability Predicition in Early Design, 2.) Data Quality, 3.)
              Testing Distributed Systems, 4.) Software Evolution, 5.) Integration of
              Software Process Models and Metrics, 6.) Spotlighting the  Code: A SERC
              Technology Development and Transfer Project, 7.) Metrics Directed Verification
              of Motorola SDL Designs, 8.) Managing Consistency in Software Specifications,
              9.) An Integrated Cost Model for Software Reuse: Design and Implementation,
              10.) Requirements Validation Using Specification Animation and 11.) Tool
              Support for the Development of Pattern-oriented Design Frameworks.
