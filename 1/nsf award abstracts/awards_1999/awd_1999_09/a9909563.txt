	The purpose is to investigate
              the nucleation, growth and transport of contaminant particles in high-density
              plasmas with relevance in semiconductor processing tools.  Experimental and
              modeling contributions in aerosols, plasma physics and chemistry will be
              included in an overall methodology to develop new generations of
              contaminant-free processes and processing tools.  The University of Minnesota
              will collaborate with four industrial partners: Applied Materials (manufacturer
              of processing tools), SEMATECH (representing semiconductor device
              manufacturers), MicroTerm (small business company), and Sandia National
              Laboratories (for collaboration in aerosol particle formation and transport
              modeling).  A particle beam mass spectrometer developed in the University will
              be used to measure particle size distribution down to 5 nm at low pressures
              (1-10 mTorr) characteristic in high density plasma processes.  Modeling the
              particle nucleation and growth will include complex chemistry, fluid flow, heat
              transfer, and the effect of electrostatic forces and of coagulation.  This is a
              Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project.  If
              successful, the research project will lead to better understanding and design
              of particle formation and removal in semiconductor processing environment.
