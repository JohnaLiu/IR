The question of how strain is partitioned at an oblique
              plate boundary is of considerable importance, but the distribution of
              convergent margin strain in space and by mechanism is not well understood,
              despite the fact that strain partitioning is fundamental to many aspects of the
              structural geology, tectonics and seismicity of those margins.  This project
              will continue a theoretical and experimental modeling effort to understand the
              physics behind geodetic, seismic, and tectonic observations at oblique margins.
               Results are expected to help place understanding of strain partitioning on a
              firmer theoretical basis.
