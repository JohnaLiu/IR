This US-Mexico award will support Prof. Elaine Bearer of
              Brown University in a research collaboration with Prof. Marco Villanueva-Mendez
              of the Institute of Biotechnology at the National Autonoma University of
              Mexico.  The goal of the collaboration is to obtain quantitative biochemical
              information on myosins purified from plants, specifically soy beans, to
              increase our understanding of these critical cellular proteins.

The movement
              of cytoplasmic components plays a significant role in the physiology of both
              plant and animal cells.  This movement is likely to be mediated in all cells by
              cellular proteins, myosins, which are the only known action-based motors. 
              While at least 13 different family members of myosins have been identified in
              animal cells, there is only minimal information about myosins in plants.  This
              collaboration will bring together an expert in plant biology from Mexico, who
              has been successful in obtaining plant myosins, with the U.S. scientist who is
              an expert in the study of these important proteins.
