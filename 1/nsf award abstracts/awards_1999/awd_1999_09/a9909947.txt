The Barro Colorado Island (BCI) Forest Dynamics Project is the
              longest running large-scale study in the world of a tropical forest,
              established to test competing theories at the population and whole community
              level for the maintenance of high tree species diversity in tropical moist
              forests. The BCI study is the flagship project and model for a global network
              of similar plots established since 1980 throughout the New and Old World
              tropics. Current activities are to conduct the fifth complete census of the 50
              ha plot on BCI in the year 2000, extending the study to two decades. The goals
              of the fifth census are (1) to update the data on recruitment, growth, and
              survival of all woody plants >1 cm dbh (>240,000 stems) in the plot since the
              last census 5 years ago, (2) to extend the census to smaller sapling size
              classes; (3) to analyze the fate of all trees (growth, survival) as a function
              of their local biotic neighborhood, and (4) to use this neighborhood analysis
              and other information to develop a first-generation dynamical model of the BCI
              forest. Understanding these local neighborhood effects is essential for
              developing a predictive theory of canopy tree replacement, which in turn is
              critical for understanding how tree species diversity is maintained in the BCI
              forest. A preliminary neighborhood analyses on the 13-year survival of 230,000
              individual plants through the last census has been completed. There were
              significant, often strong, neighborhood effects on focal plant survival. The
              effects of four neighborhood factors were analyzed: the number of neighbors of
              the same species as the focal plant, the number of neighbors surviving from the
              first to the last census irrespective of species, the size of the focal plant
              relative to its neighbors, and the number of species among the focal plant's
              neighbors. The results, if borne out by additional data from the next census
              have important implications for understanding the factors that lead to high
              tree species diversity in tropical forest communities.
