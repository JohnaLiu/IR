Abstract    :
              	Methane (CH4) plays an important role in atmospheric chemistry and greenhouse
              warming. Its global concentration level has been increasing in recent years and
              the causes of this increase are not well understood. Surface clean air samples
              have been collected from a transect of the Pacific Ocean between Los Angeles,
              California, and Auckland, New Zealand. Under this project, these samples will
              be analyzed for 13C/12C, D/H, and mixing ratios of CH4, 13C/12C and mixing
              ratios of carbon monoxide (CO) as well as mixing ratios of selected nonmethane
              hydrocarbons (NMHC). The results of these measurements will be incorporated
              into an existing database for atmospheric modeling for constraining the global
              CH4 budget. These measurements also provide details on the interhemispheric
              concentration gradients of CH4 and other trace gases as well as information on
              atmospheric mixing across the Intertropical Conversion Zone (ITCZ), which acts
              as a buffer controlling movement of air between the Northern and Southern
              hemispheres
