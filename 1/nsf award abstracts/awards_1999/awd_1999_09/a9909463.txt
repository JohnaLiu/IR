The award supports a pilot study to investigate a major
              geological discontinuity in the Ross orogen of the Transantarctic Mountains,
              located beneath Byrd Glacier.  Concentrating on the eastern portion of the area
              immediately to the south of Byrd Glacier, the investigation will begin with a
              six-week field season in 2000-2001 focusing on two distinctly different rock
              groups: 1) the Byrd Group (Early Cambrian Shackleton Limestone and younger
              Douglas Conglomerate) will be mapped  structurally toward an understanding of
              its kinematic evolution.  2) Amphibolite-grade metamorphic rocks (Selbourne
              Marble), which crop out around Mt. Madison, will be mapped in detail and
              collected to characterize its structural and metamorphic history, as well as
              its geochronology. Helicopter reconnaissance will be conducted along the
              southwestern side of Byrd Glacier in Shackleton Limestone, and on the north
              side of Byrd Glacier in the Britannia Range in igneous and high-grade
              metamorphic rocks (Horney Formation).  Structural data will be reduced at
              Arizona State University.  Metamorphic studies of the Selbourne Marble will be
              conducted at the University of Siena.  Isotopic studies will be conducted at
              The Ohio State University (40Ar/39Ar, Sm-Nd), and at the University of Kansas
              (U-Pb) toward determining the thermochronology of the Selbourne Marble and
              constraining the provenance age of the Douglas Conglomerate.
