The North Carolina Museum of Life & Science requests
              $627,003 (54.6% of a total $1,148,397 project budget) to develop
              "Mathematics=Easy as Pi."  This will be a three-year statewide project from the
              North Carolina Museum of Life and Science on behalf of the 15 member museums of
              The North Carolina Grassroots Science Museum Collaborative to develop and
              implement programs and exhibits that will assist families, children and
              teachers to understand and appreciate mathematics.  The components are a public
              celebration of mathematics name Pi day that will be held in 15 museums on March
              14th of each year, teacher professional development workshops, 12 hands-on
              tabletop exhibits for 13 museums, and a Sharing math guide for use by families
              and children.  This initiative will serve more than 2.7 million young people
              and adults in North Carolina over the initial three-year project.  The
              materials will have continued usage beyond the project timeframe.
