Abstract    :
              On December 8, 1999, the electrical power system of the Pacific Gas and Electric
              Company (PG&E) failed in the San Francisco Bay Area, leaving more than 456,000
              customers without power in San Francisco and San Mateo counties.  The power
              outage affected businesses, government agencies, transportation, hospitals and
              individuals, potentially compromising the economy and welfare of the community
              for a number of hours.  The company announced that it would take full
              responsibility for the event and solicited damage claims from affected parties.
               As of early April, 1999, 4,895 claims had been received.  A special claims
              management unit was established at PG&E and a claims data base has been
              assembled to include all information pertinent to the processing of damage
              claims.  This represents the most complete database available, which traces the
              economic and social consequences of a specific electric power infrastructure
              failure.  PG&E has agreed to provide access to the claims database for this
              study of the indirect cost implications of the power outage for natural
              disaster situations.  The database will be used to compare empirical data on
              indirect loss with the range of models, which have been proposed by experts. 
              This project should help advance the art of estimating indirect disaster losses
              and the basis for sound mitigation policy in the U.S.
