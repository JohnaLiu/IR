Abstract    :
              This proposal will examine how rural children are migrating to cities alone and
              swelling the ranks of urban street children in Tanzania; these children leave
              school and take up informal sector work in the city, developing new survival
              strategies. There is little information on child migrants in the
              anthropological literature and this phenomenon is poorly understood. The author
              notes that it is important to differentiate between working street children and
              those who beg or who are runaways. This project would shed light on the African
              informal economy, on the process of child migration (and decision-making) and
              on the role of kinship/community in the child migration situation. Previous
              studies have indicated that "wealth in children" is an important ideal among
              Tanzanian families and child fosterage common.  The increase in lone child
              migration appears to contradict what has been understood about the social
              organization of these societies. Methods include a survey of 200 vendors,
              structured interviews and participant observation in both urban and rural
              communities.
