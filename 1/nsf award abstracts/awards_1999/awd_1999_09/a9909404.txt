The Educational Broadcasting Corporation (WNET) is
              producing 13 half-hour animated television programs to engage youth aged 8-11
              in the fun and challenge of mathematics.  Cyberchase will encourage viewers to
              develop and sustain positive attitudes toward mathematics, help increase their
              mathematics knowledge and skills, and actively involve them in mathematical
              reasoning and problem solving.  The premise of the series is that a dastardly
              fiend is on a mission to take over cyberspace.  Three youngsters are summoned
              into the cyberworld to stop him.  Their only weapon:  BRAIN POWER!  Repeatedly,
              the young heroes find themselves in danger and must use math and logic to
              escape.

In addition to the television series, Cyberchase materials and
              outreach will continue to involve children in mathematics.  Outreach components
              include:

A web component that provides mathematical activities and
              content
100,000 free copies of a Cyberchase magazine
An insert in the 4th
              grade edition of Weekly Reader - reaching 30,000 teachers and 800,000
              children.
Teachers guide to facilitate classroom use of the series
The
              incorporation of Cyberchase activities into the afterschool and weekend
              programs of Boys & Girls Clubs,   the Urban League, and the AAAS Black Church
              Project

The PI and Co-Executive Producer for the project is Sandra Sheppard,
              WNET's Director of Educational Video.  The Co-Content Directors are Cary
              Bolster, Director of PBS Mathline's K-12 projects, and Michael Templeton,
              former Content Director of "The Magic School Bus."  The Co-Executive Producer
              will be Kristin Martin, formerly Executive Producer for "The Magic School Bus."

              Solomon Garfunkel, Laura Jeffers, Jimmie Rios, Susan Markowitz, Virginia
