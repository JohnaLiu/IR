Abstract    :
              Laboratory studies of the collisions of drops in free fall are conducted to
              provide the information needed to model the formation and evolution of
              precipitation in clouds.  The experiments enable the measurement of collision
              outcomes over a wide range of drop size, atmospheric pressure, and temperature.
               The drop sizes employed are relevant to three processes: (1) accretion of
              cloud droplets by larger drops, a process that transfers cloud water to rain;
              (2) self collection between small raindrops, a mechanism thought to be
              responsible for the rapid formation of large raindrops; (3) breakup of
              raindrops caused by collisions, a process that increases the precipitation
              efficiency by multiplying the number of drops that can grow by accretion. 
              Results of the experiments are described by formulas and tables of collision
              efficiencies, temporary coalescence probabilities, and the sizes and numbers of
              satellite drops produced by breakup, over a wide range of drop size,
              temperature, and pressure.  The significance of the new data for precipitation
              initiation and evolution is evaluated using a microphysical cloud model.
