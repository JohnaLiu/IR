DLI Phase 2: Digital Libraries for Children
              

This project examines the accessibility of digital resources for young
              children.   It considers the different ways that children access, explore, and
              organize digital learning materials.  An interdisciplinary team at the
              University of Maryland is collaborating with elementary school teachers and
              children (ages 5-10) to develop a children's digital library environment
              containing text, image, audio, and video resources on animals.  The effort is
              supported by materials from the Discovery Channel and the U.S. Department of
              Interior's Patuxent Wildlife Research Center.    Although the demonstration
              testbed focuses on the content area of animals, the technologies  being built
              and evaluated are not restricted to that use.  

This is a research project
              with seven goals:  1) to understand the unique needs of children in learning
              environments; 2) to develop new visualization techniques for use in children's
              digital libraries; 3) to develop new collaboration tools for multiple
              co-located users of digital libraries; 4) to develop new presentation tools for
              digital library users; 5) to understand the impact of a digital library
              environment can have on children as researchers and learners; 6) to create
              support materials and inservice training opportunities for teachers to develop
              engagement activities that make use of a digital library environment; and 7) to
              formulate and evaluate new research methods for developing children's digital
              library technologies.    

The research is human-centered and is concerned
              about querying, browsing, organization and presentation.  In each of these four
              areas, the issues of information visualization, collaboration technologies, and
              impact on children's learning experiences are being considered.  Throughout the
              research process, diverse points of view and a wide range of experience are
              being incorporated into the evaluation protocols.  The outcomes of this
              research will be important new advances in digital library design,
              technologies, and practices for children and a suite of educational tools that
              can be broadly used in the primary school setting.
