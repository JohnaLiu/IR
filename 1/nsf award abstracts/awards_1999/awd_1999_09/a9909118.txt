Abstract    :
              This project will support final data collection and analysis for a
              Ph.D.
dissertation consisting of a detailed reference grammar, collection
              of
texts, and glossary of Wayana, a Cariban language spoken in the
              rain
forest north of the Amazon river in Brazil, Surinam and French
              Guiana.
Wayana is virtually undocumented, primarily due the the
              inaccessibility of
the region where it is spoken.  The need for documentation
              is urgent, as
there are less than a thousand speakers and in several villages
              Wayana is
not being learned by children.  Several grammatical properties of
              Wayana
are cross-linguistically rare, and one property of the verbal system
              is
apparently unprecedented; a clear description will provide
              linguistic
theoreticians and typologists with the opportunity to explain
              these
properties.  Given reliable lexical and grammatical descriptions,
              Wayana
may finally be placed in the proper branch of the Cariban
              family,
potentially shedding light on the pre-history of the region. 
              This
description will also serve as a foundation for the elaboration
              of
literacy materials.
