The Grenvillian Orogeny that affected eastern Canada and
              the eastern and southern seaboard of the U.S. at about 1.0 Ga is normally
              interpreted to be a continent-continent collision between North America and a
              large continental mass to the southeast.  However considerable controversy
              exists about whether South America (Amazonia), Africa, Mexico or some other
              craton was involved.  This project will test and employ a relatively new dating
              technique to attempt to determine if Mexico is a viable candidate for the
              continental mass that collided with the southern part of the Orogen.  Results
              will help clarify precambrian plate positions and a successful test of the new
              dating method is expected to be applicable elsewhere.
