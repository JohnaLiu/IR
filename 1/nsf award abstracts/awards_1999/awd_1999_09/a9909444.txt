Abstract    :
                   This grant provides funding for a workshop on Engineering Applications of
              Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA).  The objective of the workshop is to encourage
              collaborative work among engineers, economists, and management scientists on
              engineering applications of DEA.  Combining the strengths of each group should
              
produce exciting interdisciplinary research.  Invitations will be extended to
              members of engineering, economics and management science departments at all
              educational institutions in the area.
     The success of the workshop will
              stimulate exciting multidisciplinary research and contribute to faculty
              development and research.  It will also assist in the integration of
              engineering and the liberal arts at 
Union College and thus impact the
              educational experience of undergraduates.
