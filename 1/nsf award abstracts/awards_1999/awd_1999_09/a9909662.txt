Since 1964, the International Seismological Centre
              (ISC) has produced the world's
most comprehensive and reliable global
              catalogue of earthquake hypocenters, 
magnitudes, and associated phase data. 
              In this project, the ISC will broaden and deepen 
the data that it offers
              beyond those that have been reported in its Bulletin in the
past in three
              ways.  (1) Integrate the Engdahl, van der Hilst and Buland
(EHB) catalogue and
              procedures; we plan to identify corresponding events
and arrivals in the EHB
              and ISC data and implement EHB procedures to extend
the catalogue forward. 
              (2) Recover unassociated seismogram readings from the ISC
archive and insert
              them in the ISC's data management system; unravelling
data from a variety of
              formats over more than 30 years will make 40% more
readings available.  (3)
              Integrate readings from a temporary PASSCAL experiment
into the ISC database
              as a prototype for routinely using temporary station
data.  Seismologists will
              gain straightforward, reliable access to newly
integrated data from a
              well-known source.  Further, the ISC will adopt new
procedures that enable
              ongoing compilation and free access of more data.
