Arc-continent collisions
              commonly involve additions of material by tectonic accretion and subtractions
              of material by tectonic and surficial erosion.  A number of models have been
              proposed for this system, and this project will attempt to test them by using
              the active Taiwan arc-continent collision.  One of the fundamental questions in
              these models is whether erosion and tectonic accretion reach a steady-state,
              and if so, how long does it take.  The work involves structural mapping,
              geochronology and GPS geodesy.  Results are expected to provide a test for the
              steady state eroding wedge model for arc-continent collisions which will
              address several important issues relating to constructive and 
steady-state
              mountain belts generally.
