Abstract    :
              Recent developments in science and technology have advanced capabilities to both
              fabricate and control material systems on the scale of nanometers. These
              developments, in turn, have brought problems of materials behavior on nanometer
              scale into the domain of engineering. The field of mechanics has an important
              role to play in bringing new ideas to practical fruition and in enabling the
              technologies to meet a range of societal needs. The branch of mechanics
              research in this emerging field can be termed "nano- and micro-mechanics of
              materials". It is timely for the mechanics community to focus its thinking on
              the underlying challenges and to establish an effective, reliable national
              program and infrastructure on nano- and micro-mechanics of materials.
