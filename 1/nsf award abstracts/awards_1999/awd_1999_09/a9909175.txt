This is an accomplished based renewal award to continue
              research in paleogeomagnetism. The basic approach has been to use global
              databases to examine assumptions used in paleomagnetism and to determine what
              information can be obtained about the properties of, and processes acting in,
              Earth's deep interior through the analysis of paleomagnetic data. The
              investigators plan to combine directional and intensity data in such a way as
              to maximize the information they can extract about evolution of boundary
              conditions imposed upon Earth's core. In much the same way as they have
              developed and applied analysis methodology for the geomagnetic polarity time
              scale in order to learn about the deep Earth, they intend to develop and use
              new methodologies from modern information theory for the characterization and
              analysis of secular variation.
