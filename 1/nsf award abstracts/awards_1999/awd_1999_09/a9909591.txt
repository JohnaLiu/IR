Abstract    :
              We propose to longitudinally investigate children's algebraic concepts and
              notation from grades 2 through 4 in order to understand how they develop in
              accordance with their understanding of number and quantity.  Classroom teaching
              experiments in mathematics will provide a setting for the work.  The research
              will be largely exploratory, relying upon analyses of classroom episodes,
              clinical interviews, and written productions by the children.  This methodology
              yields more than a convenience vantage point for observing children's
              development; it influences their very mathematical learning and thinking.
