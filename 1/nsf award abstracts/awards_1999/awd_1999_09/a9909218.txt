Abstract    :
              This proposal will support the prototype development, testing and evaluation of
              wireless instrumentation technology at Long Term Ecology Research Centers
              supported by NSF.  The project will determine the utility of wireless
              instrumentation for field science in remote locations and will establish
              requirements to provide realtime dataflows from sites having widely divergent
              geographical and climactic conditions.  In the process, local personnel at each
              involved center, as well as some from the LTER Network Office will learn how to
              establish and manage a networked system of wireless instruments appropriate to
              their particular location and research.
