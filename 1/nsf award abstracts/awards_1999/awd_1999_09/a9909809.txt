The investigators will attack fundamental problems in solar
              physics involving the acceleration of high-energy particles, the magnetic field
              structure in and above active regions, and the temperature distributions and
              energetics in large-scale coronal structures. The work is intimately associated
              with spacecraft observations from the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Yokoh
              X-ray satellite, and the EIT instrument on the Solar and Heliospheric
              Observatory (SOHO), as well as vector magnetogram measurements from several
              sources. The main effort is to acquire and analyze simultaneous radio
              measurements necessary for proper interpretation of these gamma, X-ray,
              ultra-violet, and optical data. These data will be obtained primarily from the
              Very Large Array (VLA) of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, the
              Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Millimeter Array (BIMA), the Nobeyama
              Radioheliograph in Japan, and the Owens Valley Solar Array in California.
              Observations during the present solar maximum are a particular focus of this
              program. Properly interpreted radio data permit determination of many physical
              parameters, such as coronal magnetic field strengths and the magnetic
              configurations above active regions, that cannot be obtained by any other
              technique. Knowledge of these parameters is vital to any models of solar flares
              and active regions.
