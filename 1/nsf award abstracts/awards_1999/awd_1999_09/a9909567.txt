The goal of grant EAR-9909567 is to take advantage of recent
              improvements in the precision and automation of 40Ar/39Ar geochronology to
              perform an intensive dating program of Quaternary volcanic products along the
              western Mexican volcanic arc.  In addition, we will use field measurements and
              topographic maps to quantify the volume of magma erupted over the last 1 Myr.
              The climate and infrastructure within this 200 km arc segment, render it among
              the best in the world for accurately quantifying the volume of erupted magma
              over this time period.  Our primary aim is to obtain a quantitative history of
              the eruptive flux, in terms of the volume and relative proportion of magma type
              erupted along the strike of the arc.  We will test whether the volcanic output
              varies as a function of crustal thickness, rate of slab subduction, age of
              subducted slab, and degree of lithospheric extension.
