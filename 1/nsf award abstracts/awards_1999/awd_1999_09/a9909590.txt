Development will continue on a new method for
              determining the ages of young basaltic volcanic rocks, the most abundant lava
              type erupted on the earth. The research involves measurements of Pb isotopic
              composition combined with measurements of U/Pb and Th/Pb ratios in minerals,
              glass and groundmass in volcanic rocks.  The research requires a special
              approach to measuring Pb isotope ratios.  The approach had been developed with
              a previous grant, but we hope to improve the resolution.  With this new
              technique it will be possible to better understand the processes by which magma
              is produced in the earth and transported to the surface for eruption.  The work
              will focus on application of the technique to submarine mafic lavas,
              particularly those with low potassium concentrations.  Low-K lava is widespread
              on the earth, and particularly difficult to date by other methods.  Preliminary
              work shows that Pb isotopes in minerals of many basalts are more variable than
              expected.  The causes and implications of these variations will be
further
              investigated as well.  The rocks and minerals that will be measured will be
              collected from Hawaii, the western U.S., and Italy, and additional submarine
              lavas will be obtained from other sources. To help interpret the Pb isotope
              data, analyses of Sr and Nd isotopes will also be made.
