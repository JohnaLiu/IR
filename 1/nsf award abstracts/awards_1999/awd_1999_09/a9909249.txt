The field of systems and control is a multidisciplinary
              technology area that is crucial for the analysis and design of systems that are
              critical in modem science and engineering.  Applications include power and
              energy systems, transportation systems, consumer appliances and electronics,
              robotics, automated industrial processes, chemical and process control, defense
              and aerospace systems, marine systems and many others.  System and control
              methodologies are becoming increasingly important in macroeconomic and
              macroeconomic studies, financial systems, system dynamics for emerging and
              mature industries and socioeconomic systems.

In parallel with the exploding
              applications, during the past decade the PI's have seen a great degree of
              progress in the development of novel theories, methodologies, and
              computer-aided design software for systems analysis and control system design.
              Such theoretical advances provide engineers and scientists with solid
              methodology foundations for the study of systems that are increasingly complex.
               In succinct terms, systems and control theory deal with optimal decision
              making strategies under dynamic uncertainties.  Much remains to be done to
              develop relevant now theories and methodologies, since there is a "theory gap"
              for the class of applications that involve complex large-scale systems,
              decentralized/distributed decision making with increased dynamic
              uncertainty.

The purpose of the proposed workshop is to convene, by
              invitation only, a small select group of distinguished international and
              Portuguese experts to assess the state-of-the-art in systems and control theory
              and help define new and relevant directions for research for the next
              decade.
