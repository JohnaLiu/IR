The 3.2 to 3.6 billion year old Barberton greenstone belt is a
              well-preserved, generally weakly metamorphosed sequence of volcanic and
              sedimentary rocks that has been the subject of considerable attention over the
              past 30 years.  Contained within this sequence is some of the best evidence for
              the earliest known life on Earth, unusual surface conditions due to higher
              temperatures and oxygen-poor atmosphere, large meteorite impacts, complex
              development of continents, and diverse styles of volcanism.  Indeed, the Earth
              during this era may be a good analog for a major evolutionary stage of many
              terrestrial planets, including Mars.  This project will evaluate the
              distribution of the very-high temperature komatiitic lavas within the
              greenstone belt, especially those in the younger formations, 3.2 to 3.4 billion
              years old.  Field studies will continue a long-term mapping project by LSU and
              Stanford geologists, especially examining relationships in structural blocks
              along the northern margin of the belt.  Geochemical studies will examine major
              and trace element compositions of primary igneous minerals (spinel and
              pyroxene) and whole rocks.  Geochronological studies will be conducted to
              correlate volcanic units across major structural boundaries, and to further
              delineate the existence of progressively younger, and compositionally more
              complex, komatiitic volcanic centers toward the northern margin of the belt. 
              This study should contribute to our understanding of how early mantle processes
              formed stable continental blocks through episodic, plume-driven komatiitic
              volcanism; and at the same time  contribute to our understanding of the
              evolution of biological and surficial systems on early Earth.
