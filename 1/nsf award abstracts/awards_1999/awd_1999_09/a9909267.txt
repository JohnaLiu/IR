The increasing availability of large numbers of
              high-quality digital
records from the global seismic networks has made
              possible a 
variety of new ways to study deep Earth seismic structure.  By
              analyzing
hundreds or thousands of seismograms, it is often possible to
              resolve
new features in the data, or to perform more comprehensive analyses
              of
problems that were previously addressed on smaller scales.
This project
              proposes to continue and extend analyses of global seismic datasets to resolve
              details of deep Earth structure.  Proposed studies include:  1) analysis of
              upper-mantle discontinuity (410- and 660-discontinuities) amplitude variations
              using PP and SS precursors, 2) the use of back-projection and migration methods
              to better image mantle discontinuity structure (applied to SS precursors and
              receiver functions), 3) modeling and inversion of PKP and PP precursors to map
              the intensity of scattering from small-scale heterogeneity in the mantle, 4)
              analyses of P-wave spectra to resolve the frequency dependence and lateral
              variability in mantle attenuation, and 5) systematic analysis of S-to-P
              converted phases to identify hypothesized discontinuities in the mid-mantle
              related to chemical heterogeneity.
