A GIS Analysis to Assess the Effect of
              Large-Scale Perturbations in the Physical Environment on the Evolution of
              Neogene Mammal Faunas in the Western United States 


A three-year research
              project will utilize a Geographic Information System (GIS) to spatially and
              temporally analyze Miocene mammal taxa, localities, and associated data for the
              western United States. Hypotheses relating to the effect of major
              physical-environmental perturbations (such as tectonism and climate change) on
              taxonomic richness will be tested.  Effects of the Miocene perturbations, which
              took place over a million-year time scale, will be compared to effects of
              climatic perturbations at the thousand-year scale by utilizing the already
              existing FAUNMAP database. The study will also explore how deeply in time some
              major features of the modern Western U.S. mammal fauna are rooted, notably
              compositional features such as relative number of species within families,
              provinciality, and overall diversity within certain regions. Besides clarifying
              the role of the physical environment as a motor of evolution, the proposed
              research is important in: (1) examining the interplay between habitat
              fragmentation and faunal turnover rates, of interest to conservation biology
              and the land-management community; and (2) developing databases and other
              web-based resources for the paleobiological community.
