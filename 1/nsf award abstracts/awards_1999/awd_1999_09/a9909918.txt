This planning grant project originates from Meredith College in
              Raleigh, NC.  The purpose of the project is to investigate and plan for the
              creation of a statewide team of PreK-8 mathematics leaders for North Carolina.
              The project is based on the successful Teaching Excellence and Mathematics
              project (TEAM-I), which focused on elementary mathematics.  That NSF supported
              project developed a cadre of elementary teachers who assisted in providing
              staff development in the content and pedagogy of mathematics at the elementary
              school level.  This initiative hopes to develop a plan to replenish the pool of
              mathematics teacher leaders within the state and to extend their role to
              PreK-8.   The planning is partially in response to needs associated with the
              Spring, 2000 release of the NCTM Principles and Standards for School
              Mathematics and the related North Carolina implementation of their newly
              revised state curriculum.
