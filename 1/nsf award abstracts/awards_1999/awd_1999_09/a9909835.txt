Special Project:
              Research Foundations for Improving the Representation of Women in the
              Information-Technology Workforce

This CISE Special Project proposal requests
              funds to hold a virtual workshop with multiple discussion groups, moderated by
              selected researchers, to identify a research agenda with the goal of increasing
              the participation of women in the IT workforce and then to perform outreach to
              inform stakeholders of the research agenda.  The project has the potential to
              promote research which will ultimately enhance the education, recruitment,
              retention, and advancement of women in the IT workforce.
