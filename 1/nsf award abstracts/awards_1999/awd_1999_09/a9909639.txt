The proposed research will extend studies of Ca stable
              isotope variations in nature by determining the 44Ca/40Ca isotopic ratio of
              seawater and how it has changed over geologic time.  Variations of the
              44Ca/40Ca ratio in the oceans correspond to changes in the balance between
              delivery of Ca to the oceans by rivers and its removal into calcareous
              sediments.  The Ca balance in reflects the relationship between weathering and
              carbonate sedimentation, which control the amount of carbon dioxide in the
              atmosphere and hence affect global climate.  Consequently, this study will
              improve our understanding of which earth processes have been most influential
              in determining the global climate of the earth. 
Previous work shows that the
              44Ca/40Ca ratio is shifted as a result of biological processes; the ratio
              decreases as Ca moves through food chains to higher trophic levels. Because Ca
              is removed from the oceans mainly by biological processes, there is an effect
              on the 44Ca/40Ca of the oceans, which produces the relationship between the Ca
              isotopic composition of the paleo-oceans and the global Ca cycle.  The more
              recent part of the geologic record, back through the age of the oldest ocean
              floor (about 200 million years) will be the focus of the study.  During this
              part of the geologic record, we can learn the most because we can compare the
              observed Ca isotopic variations to other indicators of past climate and ocean
              chemistry.   
The 44Ca/40Ca ratio will be measured on samples of calcium
              carbonate.  These samples will be obtained from DSDP and ODP cores, from
              on-land sections in Italy, and other on-land sections. A limited survey of
              modern marine environments will also be done to investigate variability among
              modern carbonates and to characterizing the modern sources of Ca in the
              oceans.
