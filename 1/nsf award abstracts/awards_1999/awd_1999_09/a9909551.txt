Quantitative tectonic models seeking to explain the
              evolution of the Indo-Asian collision zone make testable predictions regarding
              the thermal and physical state of the interior Himalayan and Tibetan crust. 
              However it is difficult to obtain suitable samples to test these models because
              most of Tibet has experienced little Tertiary denudation, thus limiting the
              level of exposure to shallow depths.  This project is aimed at obtaining the
              required samples to test the models by using exposures of middle crustal rocks
              brought to the surface by a large north - south trending graben.  Results
              should provide the pattern of unroofing and other mechanisms of graben
              formation as well as allowing assessment of several models of mid-crustal
              development during the Neogene.
