In this project, researchers from the University of New Mexico
              (UNM) will cooperate with the University of Auckland (Auckland/New Zealand) to
              perform basic studies related to the quantum engineering of advance ultrafast
              two-photon absorption (TPA) semiconductor devices with the objectives of
              elucidating all the key steps leading to optimized ultrafast TPA devices for
              lightwave communication systems.  Specific technical objectives include the
              design and fabrication of new quantum-confined structures, measurement of the
              precise magnitudes of the TPA coefficient, demonstration of novel
              processingmethods that will lead to an increase in the effective bandwidth of
              TPA photonic devices, and detailed linear and non-linear spectroscopic studies
              of these devices.

The field of two photon absorption in semiconductors is of
              mutual interest to both countries (US/NZ), as investigations in this basic area
              of optics provides an excellent opportunity for the training/education of
              future scientists and engineers specializing in photonics, in addition to its
              applicability in ultrafast optical communications.  This collaborative effect
              will benefit the UNM researcher team through Auckland's expertise in
              fundamental properties of nonlinear optics in semiconductors, and in materials
              research & processing issues regarding growth of quantum-confined structures
              (quantum wells & quantum dots) and related device fabrication.
