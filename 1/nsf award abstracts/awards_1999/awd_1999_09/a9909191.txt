This Americas Program award will support Dr. Guillermo
              Vasquez de Velasco, Texas A&M,  to travel to Montevideo, Uruguay to prepare a
              proposal for a Joint Workshop of the Americas Network.  During this visit, Dr.
              de Velasco will conduct a regional coordination meeting leading to the
              production of the proposal.  This meeting will take place in the context of the
              third annual meeting of the Iberoamerican Society for Digital Graphics.  The
              objective of the network is to promote collaborative activities at
              inter-continental level.  In support of such objective the network offers a Web
              Site that provides hyper-linkage to the Web Site of all member institutions of
              the network, reference to on-going collaborative project, and a refereed
              electronic publication for the dissemination of scholarly work.  In addition,
              development of distance education media and the possibility of establishing a
              collaborative curriculum will be discussed.

Other small scale collaborative
              initiatives in which two or three institutions may participate will also be
              discussed.
