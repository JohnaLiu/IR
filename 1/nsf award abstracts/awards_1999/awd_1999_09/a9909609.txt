The overall goal of this project is to determine exactly how
              the continental lithosphere deforms over its entire thickness during the
              building of the Himalayas.  The P.I.s will deploy a unique 700 km. long,
              high-density broadband seismic transect across the Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau in
              cooperation with Nepalese, Chinese, French and German collaborators.  The
              results will be used to determine which of three competing models is more
              appropriate: 1) Indian lithosphere underthrusts Tibet with little deformation,
              2)Himalaya is a sequence of thrust stacks that involve the entire crust and
              uppermost mantle, or 3) Both crust and uppermost mantle shorten appreciably and
              the crust is weak between them.  The project will provide the critical
              information that is missing at depth beneath key segments of the collision
              zone, and will map out the geometry and kinematics of prominent crustal, Moho,
              and upper mantle interfaces that are key for understanding how the mantle is
              linked to portions of the lithosphere. Specific research targets include: 
              Mantle-involved deformation in the Himalayan foreland - how deep does the
              deformation go;  the configuration of various thrust surfaces at depth and how
              the thrusts work; and the structure of the Yarlung-Zangpo suture zone its
              northward extent and the fate of the underthrust Indian lithosphere.
