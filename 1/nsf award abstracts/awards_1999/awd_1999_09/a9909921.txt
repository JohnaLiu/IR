Abstract    :
              This program will provide the hardware for the computer front end of the
              Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC).  The CCMC is a multi-agency
              project whose purpose is to address the issue of how new computational models
              for Space Weather predictions can be integrated, coupled and ultimately
              transitioned from research status to operational status.  The hardware for the
              CCMC consists of two primary components, a modern supercomputer system located
              at the Air Force Weather Agency in Omaha, Nebraska, and a front-end system
              located at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.  The main
              computer system is provided by the Air Force.  The network connections between
              the main system and the front end are being provided by the Air Force and NASA.
               The staffing for the CCMC is being provided primarily by NASA.  NSF is
              providing part of the hardware for the front end system and the remainder is
              being provided by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR).
