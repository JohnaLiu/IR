The deep focus earthquake process remains poorly
              understood.  The strength of the material of the subducting slab may limit the
              distribution and size of these events.  Furthermore, plastic instabilities
              remain as a possible cause of these events.  The data obtained in this study
              will define the limitations imposed by the rheology of the faulting material on
              these events.  The PI and colleagues will investigate the rheological
              properties of the olivine, wadsleyite, and ringwoodite phases in the pressure
              and temperature domain of a subducting slab. A  synchrotron x-radiation source
              coupled with a multi-anvil high-pressure system will be used to conduct an
              experimental study of these materials in the pressure range up to 20 GPa and
              temperatures from room temperature to 1200C. The approach is to characterize
              the rheology and underlying processes that govern flow in the appropriate
              pressure and temperature conditions of a subducting slab.  The investigators
              will determine the temperature dependence of the strength of the materials and
              the stress - strain rate relation at these conditions.   This information will
              yield estimates of activation energies for the flow process.  With transmission
              electron microscopy, they will characterize the dislocation density and
              structure of the material corresponding to different regimes of the
              deformation.  Taken together, these data will be useful to extrapolate to
              possible conditions that exist in the subducting slab and will be useful for
              constraining the earthquake process as well as delineating
