The structural chemistry and phase transformation
              behavior of compounds in the iron-sulfur system are important in settings from
              the Earth's core to crust where, for example, pyrite (FeS2) formation from
              mackinawite (FeS) is a key process in several geochemical cycles.  While the
              structures of many of the phases of importance to planetary surfaces and
              interiors are known, significant questions remain.  These include resolution of
              conflicting proposals for phase diagrams, crystal structures (nuclear and
              electronic) and the mechanisms of phase transformations between the compounds
              with stoichiometry close to FeS.  The research funded by this grant will
              concentrate on the following key questions: 1) what are the structures adopted
              by FeS at high temperature and pressure?  Reports of structural changes at
              intermediate temperatures and pressures will be studied using diamond anvil
              high pressure cells and a newly installed detector system on the Stony Brook
              large volume high pressure device.  2) What is the nature of the intermediate
              magnetic structure at high pressure? 3) When FeS is precipitated in low
              temperature aerobic or anaerobic environments, what are the determining factors
              promoting stability, the transformation to pyrite, or to other competing
              phases?  These questions are addressed using in situ techniques, which
              replicate conditions of relevance to earth environments.  Parts of this project
              rely on neutron and synchrotron X-ray sources in the US and in the UK, where
              these in situ experiments will be carried out.
