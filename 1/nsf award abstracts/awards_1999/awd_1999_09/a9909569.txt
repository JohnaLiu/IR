Abstract    :
              
This proposal requests support for the linkage and analysis of the Third
              International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Longitudinal Study
              of American Youth (LSAY).  It would identify primary factors associated with
              student achievement in mathematics and science.  In addition, it would use a
              classification system developed for TIMSS to construct curricular measures from
              data collected by LSAY.  The linkages would enhance the value of each data set
              and  yield additional information about the interplay of family and home
              contexts and curricular and classroom processes on achievement.
