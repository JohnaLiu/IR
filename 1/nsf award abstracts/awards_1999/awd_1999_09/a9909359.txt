This project tests a model for the formation and
              preservation of an unusual epithermal precious metal deposit in the Greater
              Antilles. Features which make the Camaguey District on the island of Cuba
              distinct include: 1) the deposits formed late in the history of the host island
              arc; 2) mineralization took place on a deeply eroded arc batholith; 3) the
              deposits are relatively old (late Cretaceous) indicating that they were
              preserved early in their history and left undisturbed since. Central to the
              model we propose are the ages of such features as the Camaguey Batholith, the
              rhyolites of the associated La Sierra Formation, and the age of mineralization
              itself. Existing geochronological constraints are poor, with the exception of
              adularia-sericite related mineralization at the Jacinto deposit. We address
              this issue by proposing to date all of the relevant units. Specifically, laser
              40Ar/39Ar will be used to date hornblendes and biotites of the Camaguey
              batholith, feldspars from La Sierra Formation rhyolites, plus adularia and
              alunite from precious metal deposits. In addition, we will use vacuum
              encapsulated irradiation to date sericite samples from both adularia-sericite
              and acid sulfate deposits. The project addresses important issues, both for
              economic geology and for the history of the Caribbean. In particular, if the
              model for formation of the Camaguey District can be confirmed, it opens up new
              exploration strategies for epithermal deposits in what would normally be
              considered unpromising terranes. In addition, we will be able to constrain the
              petrological evolution of this island arc, as well as estimate the rate of
              erosion between the emplacement of the Camaguey Batholith and formation of the
              gold and silver deposits.
