This award provides supplementary funding to ECS 9733121 to
              support cooperative research, and training opportunities for U.S. students at
              the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).  Through this
              collaboration, researchers and students at Virginia Tech will have access to a
              very advanced microelectronic fabrication facility at HKUST and a state of the
              art clean room facility for their work on fabricating a new class of power
              semiconductor devices.  Semiconductor power devices form the heart of power
              electronics and are very important to the U.S. economy.  More specifically,
              they form the heart of the Power Electronics Building Block (PEBB).  The
              objective of the proposed research is to develop a new class of power
              semiconductor devices, the emitter-controlled thyristors (ECTs) for the
              PEBB.

This award adds an international dimension to planned educational
              activities in the original CAREER award, and will help equip students to
              develop international competence.  The collaboration with Hong Kong will
              contribute to technological innovations that will serve our societal and
              national goals.
