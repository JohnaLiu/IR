The primary goal of this research is to evaluate the chemical
              equilibria
involving ferrous and ferric iron and hydrogen in metapelitic rocks
              from
western Maine and related rocks at Black Mountain, New Hampshire.  We
              will
study samples from graphite, magnetite, and hematite-bearing rocks at
              three
different metamorphic grades: garnet, lower sillimanite, and
              staurolite
zone.  This will permit the determination of: (1) in situ
              partition
coefficients for Fe3+ and Fe2+ among all the Fe-bearing phases and
              for H
among hydrous phases; (2) the temperature and fO2 dependence
              of
Fe3+/Fetotal and effects of Fe3+ substitution on other cation
              substitutions
plus their implications for geothermometry; and (3) the
              cation
substitutions that charge balance variations of H and Fe3+.  We will
              also
characterize and seek to understand Fe3+/Fetotal zoning within
              individual
mineral grains as well as variation of Fe3+/Fetotal among grains of
              the
same mineral in the same rock; ultimately, we will assess the effects
              of
assemblage on Fe3+/Fetotal in the constituent mineral phases present.
              
These measurements will be made on standard 1" round petrographic
              thin
sections using beam sizes of less than 10 x 15 micrometers and
              the
relatively rapid, non-destructive techniques of synchrotron
              microXANES
spectroscopy (SmX) for Fe3+/Fetotal, ion microprobe (SIMS) for H,
              and the
electron microprobe (EPMA) for other major elements. With our
              analytical
results in hand, we can begin to address the competing effects
              of
assemblage and crystal chemistry on the incorporation of Fe2+ and Fe3+
              in
metapelite minerals.  We also hope to effectively and quickly
              demonstrate
the potential importance of SmX as a petrologic tool.
