Abstract    :
              This project is to measure fluctuation in the Earth's magnetic field on time
              scales between 0.1 s and 1000 s.  These "micropulsations" are the result of the
              interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere.  By studying
              these variations over periods of time comparable to a complete solar cycle and
              at a variety of locations, it is possible to learn more about how variations in
              the solar wind effect the Earth and man made systems.  Magnetic variations have
              important effects on such systems as power grids and pipelines, and it may be
              important to predict such disruptions.  This is now becoming possible, since
              satellite systems are in place to monitor the solar wind as well as to view
              solar activity.  The main reason to do work of this nature is to obtain a
              better understanding of the world, but the prediction of space weather is also
              an important aspect.
This project uses magnetometers that are distributed at
              high latitude in both the Antarctic and Arctic so, for that reason, the work is
              supported by both the Arctic and Antarctic programs of the Office of Polar
              Programs.  The principal investigator is a professor at an undergraduate
              institution.
