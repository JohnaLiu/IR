This award is for support for two years of funding to
              reconstruct the retreat history of the West Antarctic ice sheet along a
              flowline through the Ford Ranges in Marie Byrd Land, from the last glacial
              maximum to present.  The ice surface elevation history of the region will be
              reconstructed by cosmogenic isotope exposure dating of moraine boulders and
              ice-abraded bedrock surfaces in the Clark, Allegheny and Sarnoff Mountains. 
              Altitude transects will date the thinning of the ice sheet at each of these
              three sites, where the present ice surface stands at ~1200 m, ~800 m and
              200-400 m respectively.  This research will produce a deglaciation chronology
              for Marie Byrd Land capable of resolving competing models of ice sheet retreat
              and will provide a data set for testing numerical models of the West Antarctic
              ice sheet through the glacial cycle.  In addition, the results will help
              constrain the past ice load in West Antarctica and therefore help to predict
              the effect of glacioisostatic motion on geodetic surveys being carried out in
              the region.
