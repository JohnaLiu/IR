Abstract    :
              A conference on computer-aided process design will take place on July 18 - 23,
              1999 in Breckenridge, Colorado.  The Fifth International Conference on
              Foundations of Computer-Aided Process Design (FOCAPD '99) is the only
              international conference that focuses exclusively on computer-aided design for
              chemical processing.  This is the fifth conference in this series, which brings
              together engineers,s cientists, faculty, and graduate students from
              universities government laboratories, processing industries, and technology
              companies to assess and critique current research trends and to influence
              future directions of computer-aided process design.  Topics addressed include:
              state-of-the-art and challenges in process design, fundamental design theories
              and methods, environments and new tools for more effective process design,
              emerging areas, and industrial needs.  The support will be used to increase the
              participation of young faculty and students at the conference.  This conference
              represents an educational opportunity for future researchers and practitioners
              in the chemical processing industries.
