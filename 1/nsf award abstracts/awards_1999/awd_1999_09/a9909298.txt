Abstract    :
              Instability plays a crucial role in the design of solids and structures as it
              often limits their performance from their manufacturing stage to their
              installation and operation.  The design of more effcient structures motivated
              the enormous progress in structural stability acheived during the period of
              1940-70.  More recently, the ares has received a new impetus form instabilities
              at the material level.  This is partly due to the advent of new materilas but,
              also due to continuing efforts to develop constitutive laws and failure
              criteria for more conventional materials.  Like in the more classical problems,
              such instabilities are governed by non linear interaction of geometry and
              material properties which now are related to the microstructure of the
              material.  Examples of this class of relatively new problems are kinking
              failure in fiber composites in compression and in wood, stress induced
              transformations in shape memory alloys, shear licalizaion in metal mono- and
              polycrystals,and localization of deformation in compressed cellular materials. 
              Similar problems are also known to govern the behavior of granular materials,
              rocks, concrete and several polymers.
