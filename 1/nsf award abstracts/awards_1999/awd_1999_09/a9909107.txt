Intelligent maintenance systems can
              significantly reduce equipment repair or down time and markedly increase
              productivity.  Industry is seeking to have this type of prognostics on a chip
              available for great many applications.  This planning grant is funding an
              industry/university meeting to determine if an Industry/University Cooperative
              Research Center on Intelligent Maintenance Systems at the Universtiy of
              Wisconsin-Milwaukee is feasible and viable.

The research projects envisioned
              for the proposed center are:

1)  Data Management and Logistics Planning for
              Intelligent Maintenance
2)  Study of Machine Degradation using Markov
              Modeling
3)  Optimization for Total Predictive Maintenance in Intelligent
              Maintenance Systems
4)  Prognostics of Mechanical Systems through Hierarchical
              Modeling
5)  Design of Scalable Hardware Platform for IMS
6)  Tolerance
              Design Methodology (TDM) for Teleservice and Maintenance System (TMS)
7) 
              Machine performance Assessment and Forecasting via Internet/Intranet
8) 
              On-line Monitoring of Cutting Tool Condition using Ultrasound Waves
9) 
              Prognostics of Semiconductor Devices for Motor Drives
10)  A Reliability Model
              for the Maintenance of Electric Distribution System Operation
6)  Tolerance
