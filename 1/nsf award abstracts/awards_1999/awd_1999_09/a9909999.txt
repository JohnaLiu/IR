This award supports Stanford Woosley, a post-doctoral
              student, and a graduate student from the University of California-Santa Cruz in
              a collaboration with Wolfgang Hillebrandt of the Max Planck Institute for
              Astrophysics in Garching bei Muenchen, Germany.  The groups will combine their
              expertise to investigate the evolution and dynamics of massive stars.  These
              short-lived giants explode as supernovae giving rise to entire new generations
              of stars, black holes, neutron stars, and the elements that make up all matter.
               Specific topics to be investigated are evolution of massive stars, the
              evolution of the progenitor of the bright supernova SN 1987A, the explosion
              mechanism for massive stars, the explosion mechanism for massive stars, "failed
              supernovae," models for gamma-ray bursts based on the accretion of stellar-mass
              objects by black holes, and neutrino-driven winds.
