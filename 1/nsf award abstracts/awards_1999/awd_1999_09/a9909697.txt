The motivation for this study is the continuing
              controversy on the mechanism for generating earthquakes at depths below 50 km,
              where material would be expected to relieve stress by plastic flow rather than
              brittle failure.  The recently discovered spatial relationship between partial
              eclogitization and pseudotachylyte of an area in western Norway provides an
              unusual opportunity to link localized fluid infiltration into dry granulite and
              resultant eclogite accompanied by 10-15% volume reduction with proxy evidence
              for transient high stress release (pseudotachylyte).  This project will
              investigate the detailed relationships between eclogite, granulite and
              pseudotachylyte to test the concept that volume reduction due to fluid
              interaction along fractures is a major mechanism for deep earthquakes. 
              Successful results are expected to be widely applicable.
