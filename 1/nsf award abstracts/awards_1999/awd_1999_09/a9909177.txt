Abstract    :
              The Desert Research Institute has requested equipment that will improve existing
              laboratory equipment by upgrading older and non-functional LDM-IDD machines,
              and provide new PC equipment for classroom instruction and laboratory
              exercises.  The new equipment will greatly aid the recent and expanding
              meteorology component, and provide forecasting laboratory facilities for
              students and scientists working at the Institute and the co-located National
              Weather Service Office.
