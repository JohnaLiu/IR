Abstract    :
              Hampton University and the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO)
              propose renewed funding for a program to increase the numbers of
              under-represented minorities electing careers in aquatic sciences.  The program
              targets minority students, faculty and professionals interested in aquatic
              sciences, as well as majority faculty working at Historically Minority Colleges
              and Universities (HMCU).  Participants received a free membership in ASLO and
              support to attend the annual meetings and special pre-meeting workshops.  The
              present proposal will cultivate the development of past participants and
              incorporate new cohorts of students into the process during the years
              2000-2004.  

Since the initiation of the program in 1990, over 300 students
              and 20 mentors have participated in the program. Participants were drawn from
              over 100 different institutions in the past ten years, with 31 different
              colleges and universities in the 1999 program alone. Dr. Cuker received a 1999
              PEW Fellowship based on his work with this project.
