Conference Support: World Congress of Landscape
              Ecology

This project will support the participation of 12 U.S. undergraduate
              students at the 5th World Congress of the International Association for
              Landscape Ecology to be held at Snowmass Village, Colorado, 29 July - 3 August
              1999. The theme of the Congress emphasizes the need for a strong scientific
              foundation for natural resources and land use planning, and the need for
              scientific investigations of population, community, and ecosystem ecology. The
              involvement of undergraduates- scientists at the earliest stages of their
              careers- will bring an important perspective to the meeting, and will benefit
              the students as well.
