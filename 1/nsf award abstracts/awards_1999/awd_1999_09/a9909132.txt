Abstract    :
              This project supports the work of the PI as co-editor for the "NSF Highlights"
              column which appears monthly in the Journal of Chemical Education.  The column
              serves to disseminate the results of projects funded in chemistry by the
              Division of Undergraduate Education, thereby also improving the understanding
              of the purposes of DUE's programs, and encouraging proposals to improve the
              quality of undergraduate education in science, mathematics, engineering and
              technology for all students.
