This project focuses on the geological record of
              molecular evolution.  Its working hypothesis is
that alkenones were first
              biosynthesized by calcareous nannoplankton in the Cretaceous, but that
              temperature-controlled synthesis of alkenone unsaturation developed in the
              Eocene as a response to cooling trends.  To answer this postulate the project
              will investigate the distributions of alkenones in suites of Paleogene and
              Cretaceous sediments from the Atlantic to determine the timing of the
              development of the temperature dependence in their biosynthesis by haptophyte
              algae.  The availability of materials from multiple sites facilitates
              exploration of the timing and geographic extent of specific alkenone
              adaptations, and provides the opportunity to correlate their characteristics
              with their source organisms, calcareous nannoplankton, and the timing of
              significant climatic events.
