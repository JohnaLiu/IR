Topographic uplift of mountain ranges and plateaus
              is intimately related to lithospheric density changes caused by various
              tectonic processes.  In the Cascade Ranges of Oregon existing interpretations
              of topographic history since the Miocene are in conflict, with one concluding
              that uplift was progressive between 20 Ma until Late Miocene and the other
              concluding that uplift did not start until the Late Miocene.  The corresponding
              tectonic inferences are that subduction-related density changes, acting over
              tens of millions of years was the responsible process or that a short-term
              forcing factor such as detachment faulting was the cause, respectively.  This
              project will test these hypotheses by using an oxygen isotopic proxy for
              elevation - isotopic ratio variation associated with mountain rain shadow
              effect as recorded in mammalian herbivores.  The intended data should be able
              to differentiate between the strong differences in model predictions of the
              competing hypotheses.  Results will be important to the tectonic history of the
              Cascades and the methodology will likely be applicable elsewhere.
