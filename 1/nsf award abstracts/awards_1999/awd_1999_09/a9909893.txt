Abstract    :
              The research supported by this award includes a variety of studies. The ring
              opening of disilylcyclopropanes to form 1,3-diradicals; the generation of
              quadricyclene, norbornyne,  norbornenyne, 3,3,44-tetrfluorocyclobutyne and
              1,2-cyclobutadiene radical anions are among the experimental goals of the work.
               A number of computational projects are also proposed.   Representative
              examples include:  the partitioning between direct and statistical trajectories
              in the Cope rearrangement  of 1,2,6-heptadiene, the effects of substituents and
              solvent on the three lowest electronic states of phenylnitrene, the Cope
              rearrangements of mono-, di- and triphenyl-1,5-hexadienes, cycloadditions of
              cyclopentyne to alkenes, reductive elimination from Pt(0) and Pt(II) complexes
              and the thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of stereoisomeric
              (R3P)2Re(CO)3(H2)+ species.

With this Renewal award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Weston T.
              Borden of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington.  
              Professor Borden will focus his work on a combination of experimental and
              theoretical problems.  The proposed studies are aimed at developing and testing
              theoretical models, that explain and predict the chemistry and spectroscopy of
              organic and organometallic molecules.  The proposed research will benefit the
              scientific infrastructure by educating undergraduate and graduate students,
              through the involvement of three faculty members from schools with only
              undergraduate research programs, and by continued exchanges of information and
              expertise with the many groups with which Dr. Borden's group collaborates.
