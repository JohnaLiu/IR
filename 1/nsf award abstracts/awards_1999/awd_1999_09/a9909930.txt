This award supports Arthur Livingston and students from the
              University of Notre Dame in a collaboration with Thomas Stoehlker of the
              Department of Atomic Physics at the Gesellschaft fuer Schwerionenforschung
              (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany.  The project will establish a strong collaborative
              research program between the accelerator-based atomic physics group at Notre
              Dame and the heavy-ion atomic physics group.  The collaborative effort will
              combine expertise on both sides in the atomic structure and spectroscopy of
              highly-charged uranium ions.  The research will involve the implementation of a
              new, energy-sensitive charge-coupled device detector system in the heavy ion
              storage ring at GSI.  The primary goal is to measure the energy of the 1s2s
              ground state  1s2p first excited state transition in helium-like uranium
              (U90+).  For the first time, highly precise measurements will allow a test of
              uncalculated quantum electrodynamics terms in highly charged helium-like atoms.
               The results will also be useful for many other species of ion.
