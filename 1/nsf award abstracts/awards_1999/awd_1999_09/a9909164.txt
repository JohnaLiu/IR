Abstract    :
              This award provides travel support and local expenses for 25 participants of a
              two-day public workshop on Statistics and information technology (IT), to be
              held on September 16-17, 1999, at the NISS building in Research Triangle Park,
              North Carolina. The purpose of the workshop is to expose statisticians to
              researchers and to research problems in information technology.  Several
              important problem areas in information technology will be presented from the
              perspectives of both IT and Statistics, with ample opportunity for questions
              and discussion.  The topic areas to be discussed are: digital government,
              Internet traffic measurement and analysis, software development, data/model
              integration, and human-computer interaction.  A workshop report will be
              prepared and made available over the World Wide Web shortly after the
              conference.
