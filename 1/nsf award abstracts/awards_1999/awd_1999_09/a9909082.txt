Abstract    :
              The American Society for Microbiology  is holding a special Microbial
              Biodiversity meeting in Chicago, August 5-8, 1999. One of the major goals of
              this conference is to bring together leading scientists to present data on the
              current state of knowledge of microbial biodiversity. Another goal is to begin
              the discussion of how microbiologists can assess the vast and unexplored
              diversity of microbial life on Earth. Some of the issues included in this
              latter topic, which is the focus of a special roundtable, will be:
	How can
              microbial diversity be assessed?
	What environments, in addition to marine and
              terrestrial, should be studied?
	What critical questions of microbial
              biodiversity need to be answered first?
	How does microbial biodiversity
              relate to the diversity of plants and animals?
	What new technologies should
              be developed to enhance the study of microbial
	diversity?
	How should the U.
              S. A. coordinate its efforts with the international community
	in the conduct
              of microbial biodiversity studies?,
	What is the role of federal agencies,
              foundations and private industry in fostering
	and supporting microbial
              biodiversity efforts?
This award provides travel funds for participants taking
              part in the roundtable.
