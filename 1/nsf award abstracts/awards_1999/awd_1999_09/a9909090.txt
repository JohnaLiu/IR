Abstract    :
              ALCORN STATE UNIVERSITY

The Departments of Chemistry and Physics, Biological
              Sciences, Mathematics, and Industrial Technology at Alcorn State University
              propose to increase diversity in the Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and
              Tecnology (SMET) workforce by strengthening undergraduate curricula
              and
enhancing access and greater participation by minorities in graduate and
              specifically doctoral
Programs in the SMET areas. SMET courses will be made
              more rigorous by requiring that students taking general chemistry, the
              gatekeeper course, be qualified to take calculus or pre-calculus. This means
              that the student must have satisfactorily completed college algebra and
              trigonometry. Incorporation of cutting edge technology, and research-based
              instruction to enhance the learning experience of students will better equip
              students to meet the standard. SMET students, identified at the freshman level,
              will be given rigorous instruction in basic courses and mentoring in all SMET
              disciplines. The rigorous instruction and mentoring will continue throughout
              the undergraduate program and will facilitate the transition into graduate
              school.

The objectives of this project are to: (1) develop and maintain a
              diverse and intellectually vigorous faculty committed to the improvement of
              undergraduate education; (2) strengthen SMET curricula, courses and
              laboratories by Total Quality Control and Management(TQC&M) at the entry level
              classes; (3) develop partnerships with academic and industrial institutions;
              (4) prepare students for graduate school; (5) stimulate faculty and
              professional organizations to be involved in the Graduate and Research
              Opportunities Oriented Mentoring(GROOM); and (6) increase SMET enrollment,
              retention, and graduation.
