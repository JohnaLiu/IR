A major impediment in the interpretation of
              fossil assemblages has been the inadequate understanding of the biases in it
              caused (a) by the taphonomic alteration of the original assemblage of living
              organisms and (b) by the time averaging of temporally distinct faunas. To
              better understand these taphonomic processes experiments were placed in a wide
              variety of environments of deposition in deep offshore settings in 1993 and
              1994. The experiments consist of a variety of potentially preservable organisms
              such as bivalves, gastropods, urchins, crabs, and plant species. These
              materials have been allowed to decay on the sea floor since deployment.
              Collections were made after two years at all sites and the early taphonomic
              signature was assessed. The present work involves the collection of the
              experiments at year 8. Preliminary results show that this is a crucial time for
              the mollusk remains, particularly in waters within the photic zone. Dissolution
              and degradation by boring organisms have progressed to the point that the
              results from this work may be able to set the "life span" of mollusk remains in
              shallow waters at somewhere between 7 and 10 years and in deeper waters we may
              find much slower rates of degradation.
