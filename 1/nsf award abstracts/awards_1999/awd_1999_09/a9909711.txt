Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to seek matching funds for the acquisition of
              eleven Unix workstations.  These workstations are needed to replace obsolete
              machines and to reduce the student/workstation ratio in light of a continuing
              increase in the number of majors.  Since the last computer acquisition in 1997,
              enrollment in the major has increased from 60 to approximately 90 students. 
              The older machines which these workstations would replace will be distributed
              in other teaching labs or will be used exclusively for research, where system
              speed and simultaneous usage is not as critical as in a classroom setting.  The
              workstations requested in this proposal will be installed in the newly
              constructed Synoptic/Dynamics teaching lab where the majority of courses are
              taught, and thus will provide the greatest accessibility to students.
