This grant provides partial support for the acquisition of a
              2-G Enterprises 755R superconducting rock magnetometer system (SRM) for the
              Paleomagnetics Laboratory at the University of Rhode Island - Graduate School
              of Oceanography.  The addition of a SRM equipped with an automated u-channel
              sample introduction system will allow rapid, high-resolution analysis of weakly
              magnetized sediment cores and samples.  It will primarily be used for studies
              of global climate change and of the temporal variation in the behavior of the
              Earth's magnetic field.  Drilling and coring programs that require rapid
              analysis of many samples will be emphasized.  The magnetometer will be housed
              in a large shielded room along with a large access 2-G Enterprises SRM.  The
              URI Paleomagnetics Laboratory will be operated as a cost recovery center and
              will be open for collaborative studies by researchers and students from other
              institutions.  Support for this grant is shared between the Earth Sciences
              Instrumentation and Facilities Program (EAR/IF), the Division of Ocean
              Sciences, Marine Geology and Geophysics Program (OCE/MGG), Ocean Drilling
              Program (OCE/ODP) and the Atmospheric Sciences, Paleoclimatology Program
              (ATM/PC).
