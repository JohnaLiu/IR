This 18-month award will support US participation in a joint
              international workshop on optimization in composite material design and
              structural integrity to take place in Crete, Greece early in 2001.  The
              workshop will be organized by James Greer of the US Air Force Academy, Peter
              W.R. Beaumont of Cambridge University in the UK, and Costas Galiotis of the
              Foundation for Research and Technology (FORTH) in Greece.  The workshop
              involves US researchers' participation in a forum for a diverse group of
              engineers, chemists, and physicists to develop opportunities for future
              collaboration on the optimization of integrated design of materials and
              structure that maximizes structural integrity and performance.  Researchers
              will be present from Australia, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, The
              Netherlands, the UK, and the US. The focus of the meeting will be an assessment
              of the state-of-the art and its applications.  The scope will be broad to
              enable a multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach.  The ultimate objective
              is to develop computational methods of optimization that can be applied to
              solving a wide range of practical problems.
