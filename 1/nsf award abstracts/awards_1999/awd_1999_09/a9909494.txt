Fossil plants from the Singida District of
              north-central Tanzania, dated at 46 million years old, are significant because
              they will provide important information about the evolution of living plant
              groups, the historical development of tropical African plant communities, and
              the climate for a time period and part of the world from which little is
              currently known.  Studies of modern day plant communities show that leaf shape
              and size are related to the climate in which the plants live.  This
              relationship will be applied to leaf fossils from Tanzania in order to provide
              quantitative information about temperature and rainfall 46 million years ago. 
              These data will be of tangible value in testing computer climate models
              designed to study the ways in which the Earth's climate functions, how it has
              changed in the past, and how it may change in the future.
