This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in applied
              mathematics involves Joceline Lega,  Neil H. Mendelson, and a graduate student
              at the University of Arizona, and Thierry Passot of the Cote d'Azur Observatory
              in Nice, France. The project, supported under the joint program of the National
              Science Foundation and the French National Center for Scientific Research
              (CNRS), is aimed at the development of a hydrodynamic model to describe dense
              colonies of bacteria at the surface of a growth medium.  The approach follows
              hydrodynamics ideas used in astrophysics.

This award represents the U.S.
              side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for
              Scientific Research.  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses of the
              U.S. investigator and graduate student.  The CNRS will support the French
              researcher's visits to the United States.  Lega provides expertise on modeling
              of nonlinear phenomena and pattern formation; Mendelson, a cellular biologist,
              will conduct experiments to test the model and computations; and Passot, a
              physicist, provides expertise in hydrodynamics and turbulence.   Their
              collaboration will advance understanding of the "hydrodynamics" of bacterial
              colonies.
