Abstract    :
              This continuing grant funds the second five years (in accordance with
              Announcement NSF 97-164) of the multi-university Industry/University
              Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Surface Engineering and Tribology. 
              Northwestern has the lead with Georgia Institute of Technology as a partner
              research site.

The I/UCRC's research agenda addresses 1.) Fatigue Life
              Calculations for Hard Coated and Uncoated Rollers, 2.) Enhanced Tribological
              Properties of Ti N-Based PVD Coatings, 3.) 3D Surface Crack Growth Modeling for
              Rolling Contact Fatigue, 4.) Lubricant Chemistry in Concentrated 5.)
              Lubrication of Drawing and Surface Generation in Strip Rolling, 7.) Tribology
              and Fixturing of Machined Parts, 8) Slurry Film Thickness Measurements in the
              Chemo-Mechanical Polishing of Silicon, 9.) Mathematical Model of Lip Seal, 10.)
              Lubricant Rheology and 11.) Wear and Lubrication of a Thrust Washer
              System.
