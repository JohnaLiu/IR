Partial travel support is requested for young U.S. academic
              speakers at the 'Thermal Spray Processing of Nanoscale Materials' to be held in
              Quebec City in August 15-20, 1999.    The objectives are to assess the current
              state in science and technology of nanocrystalline coatings and identify future
              trends.  The conference will include state-of-the-art analysis, oral and poster
              presentations focused on novel methods for thermal spraying and the feasibility
              of large-scale industrial production of nanostructured coatings.  Industrial
              perspective and industry participation have been encouraged.  A brochure with
              the extended abstracts will be available at the meeting, and a summary article
              will be published in a scientific journal.  
The conference is co-sponsored by
              the Office of Naval Research, U.S. Engineering Foundation, National Research
              Council of Canada, and Hydro-Quebec.
