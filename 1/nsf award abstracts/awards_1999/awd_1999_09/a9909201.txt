Abstract    :
              This proposal is for a study of stable isotopes in precipitation at low
              latitudes where paleoclimate records from ice cores have recently become
              available (Andes, Tibet/Himalayas, East Africa). The analysis will be based on
              the output from versions of the ECHAM4 and NASA-GISS2 GCM's with isotopic
              tracers. Model simulations for several time periods will be compared to the
              isotope records from ice cores in the target regions. Climatic data and isotope
              measurements from ice cores for the last 30 years will help validate the model
              performance under modern conditions and will be used for calibration purposes.
              The joint observation and modeling approach will shed new light on the heavily
              disputed interpretations of stable isotopes in precipitation at low latitudes.
