Abstract    :
              This is an experimental study of the structure of a leading-edge partially
              premixed flame and a trailing diffusion flame in a layered methane-air system. 
              Conditions for the existence of triple flames at the leading edge of speeding
              flames are investigated; these have been considered as the anchoring mechanism
              for lifted flames as well as being responsible for the spread of the edges of
              diffusion flames into gaseous mixing layers.  This study aims to illuminate the
              detailed structure of the leading edge in a simple layered system using a
              variety of diagnostic techniques including CH and OH fluorescence and Rayleigh
              scattering, and to investigate the response of the leading-edge structure to
              changes in such parameters as fuel-stream and air-stream velocities, fuel
              composition, and flow orientation.
