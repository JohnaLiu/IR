Abstract    :
              Observations in the visible and near-infrared of upper-atmospheric emissions
              above South Pole Station will be used to study the heating effects of auroral
              electrical currents in the ionosphere as well as planetary waves and
              atmospheric tides.  The project is particularly timely for two reasons: first
              the sun is now in the period of maximum activity and secondly, because NASA
              will launch the TIMED (Thermosphere, Ionosphere and Mesosphere Energetics and
              Dynamics) satellite in December, 2000.  TIMED is designed to study just those
              parts of the atmosphere that that Professor Sivjee's project will.  TIMED will
              provide data on the temperature, winds and tides of the Earth's upper
              atmosphere, especially above the poles as it passes overhead; however, as is
              often the case with satellites, it is difficult to differentiate between
              variations in location or time.  The South Pole ground-based observations will
              be valuable in sorting out the time-location question.
