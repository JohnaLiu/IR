Abstract    :
              Lava-Dam Outburst Floods and Related Volcanic Features in Western Grand
              Canyon

PIs propose to use cosmogenic 3He dating combined with hydrologic,
              petrographic, and geochemical techniques to resolve the history of Quaternary
              outburst floods in the Colorado River.  This work will be supplemented by
              40Ar/39Ar work on some lava flows, and by geochemical characterization of
              lavas.  Preliminary 3He dating provides evidence for lava flows and outburst
              floods much younger than have been previously dated by K/Ar, significantly
              changing interpretations of the geomorphic evolution of western Grand Canyon.
              They will date basalt surfaces scoured by major flood events, outburst flood
              deposits, lava flows, abandoned scour channels, and perched boulder bars to
              constrain late Quaternary events in the western Grand Canyon.  This work will
              allow them to correlate lava flows with lava dams and outburst flood deposits
              and to estimate flood magnitudes based on paleoflood evidence.  This work will
              significantly change interpretations of the geomorphic evolution of western
              Grand Canyon because of the ability to accurately date events of the last 0.5
              million years.
