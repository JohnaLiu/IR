The proposed research is directed towards a better
              understanding of the geochemical behaviors of Re and Os in ultramafic-mafic
              systems, and examining and interpreting the Os isotopic compositions of
              reservoirs within both the modern and ancient mantle. Specific issues that
              Re-Os isotopes may be particularly useful in elucidating are: 1) the nature of
              material added to the Earth via late accretion, 2) the rate at which late
              accreted materials were homogenized throughout the mantle, 3) the nature and
              rate at which oceanic crust has been recycled back into certain plume sources,
              4) the existence of, and level of chemical exchange between the mantle and
              outer core, 5) the chronology of the development of subcontinental lithospheric
              keels, and 6) the distribution of highly siderophile elements in various modern
              and ancient reservoirs. Much effort will be directed towards the assessement
              of, and use of separated phases as a means of determining primary magmatic
              Re-Os systematics. The resulting information should lead to a better
              understanding of how Os isotopic heterogeneities have developed in the mantle,
              and also further our knowledge about the evolution of highly siderophile
              elements in the Earth's mantle. These results may also provide additional
              constraints on the nature of highly siderophile elements in the mantle and
              early mantle mixing rates.
