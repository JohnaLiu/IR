Two xenolith suites in NW Namibia provide a unique
              opportunity to sample directly the continental lithospheric mantle and lower
              crust in the vicinity of the major Parana-Etendeka continental flood basalt
              province. One xenolith locality falls within the sphere of influence of the
              early Tristan plume, whereas the second lies to the south of the plume
              influence, but within the same crustal unit. Detailed trace element and isotope
              analyses (Sr, Nd, Pb) on selected samples of these xenolith suites, together
              with available geochemical data on magmas from the early plume and depleted
              asthenosphere, will be used to test current models for the actual source
              regions of continental flood basalts. This project is collaborative endeavor
              with Dr. Anton le Roex, of the University of Cape Town UCT, South Africa.
