The University of Nebraska State Museum (UNSM), in a
              partnership with Nebraska Cooperative Extension 4-H, is developing a series of
              informal science education modules that focus on bringing engaging science
              activities to young people  --  especially girls aged 8-12 in rural
              communities.  These kits or modules will feature the research and life stories
              of women scientists who will be strong role models for these youth.  The
              modules are correlated to 4-H curriculum in the topics of food safety, water
              geology, remote sensing in agriculture and range management.  The modular kits
              will contain an activity book, a biographic video, a CD-ROM  and the associated
              hands-on materials to do science activities for understanding the science
              concepts discussed and illustrated by the featured researcher.
