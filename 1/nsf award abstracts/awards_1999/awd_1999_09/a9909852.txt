Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support, over an eighteen-month period, for a study
              project to examine ways in which new technological approaches may help reduce
              policy-related conflicts associated with the Internet Domain Name System. Focus
              areas will include identifying different technical options for providing
              services associated with the domain name management system, and identifying
              policies and procedures to complement each of the technical alternatives. A
              report will be generated summarizing the findings and recommendations and will
              be made broadly available to the community.
