Paleoceanographic and evolutionary studies of planktic
              foraminifera depend upon an assumption that individuals in
              morphologically-defined species share common ecologies and evolutionary
              histories.  We will analyze modern planktic foraminifera  using multiple genes
              to study the phylogeny and genetic variation in this widespread group of
              pelagic organisms. Our objectives are to (1) estimate the genetic biodiversity
              of living planktic foraminifera; (2) study the geographic and water column
              distribution of the major genotypes of these taxa in relation to  hydrographic
              conditions, and (3) examine the morphological and stable isotopic
              characteristics of the genotypes to assess their degree of ecological
              distinctiveness. By integrating to the genetic analyses, ecological analyses of
              the oceanographic data from the collected localities, as well as stable
              isotopic analyses of the foraminiferal shells, we will be able to test the
              importance of water-masses and/or depth habitat  in the evolutionary history
              and species distribution of planktic foraminifera.  Our work will help adjust
              morphological species concepts to better match the genetic and ecological
              subdivisions of natural populations.  This is a crucial requirement to create
              realistic paleoclimatic analyses based on foraminifer distributions and
              paleoclimate transfer functions as well as to understand the biodiversity and
              evolution of pelagic organisms.
