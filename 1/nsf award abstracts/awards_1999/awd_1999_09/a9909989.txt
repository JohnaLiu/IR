This award supports a US-Australia collaborative research
              program aimed at elucidating the function and evolution of feeding mechanisms
              in Red-tailed Black Cockatoos. The investigator proposes to describe the range
              of feeding mechanisms used by different species, subspecies, populations or
              morphs (the taxonomic designation of which is in flux), and to relate those
              mechanisms functionally to diet, and thus to gain insight into the evolution of
              the extreme variation in bill morphology present in this group. She proposes to
              accomplish this by observation of feeding birds in the wild, collection and
              analysis of debris from feeding events, and dissection and anatomical analysis
              of the beaks of specimens. 

The PI is recognized world-wide as an authority
              on the functional anatomy of the beak and tongue in psittaciform birds and is
              very well qualified to investigate the range of variation present in the
              anatomy of these very variable birds.  A better understanding of the feeding
              and feeding structures of these animals is also very desirable given that they
              are simultaneously threatened by the international trade in parrots, while
              functioning to some degree as crop pests at home.  The research will be
              conducted in partnership with colleagues in Australia, including researchers at
              the Australian National University, the CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology,
              and Queensland University of Technology.
