The upward motion of rock masses relative to the earth's
              surface has been documented for most major mountain belts, but because of
              compensating erosion, it is difficult to determine if significant topographic
              elevation developed and when in the tectonic cycle it occurred.  This project
              will utilize a relatively new method for estimating the age of topographic
              uplift in the Salmon River-Clearwater Mountains of Idaho, an area analogous to
              the Sierra Nevada further south in the cordillera, where paleoelevation has
              been shown to start during the Cretaceous.  Results will help determine the
              spatial pattern of elevation development in the Cordillera and will provide a
              further test or validation of the method.
