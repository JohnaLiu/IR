This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in applied
              statistics involves Theodore Chang and a graduate student of the University of
              Virginia, Richard Gordon of Rice University, and Jean-Yves Royer, of the
              European University Institute of the Sea in Brest, France.  The project,
              supported under the joint program of the National Science Foundation and the
              French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), is aimed at the
              development of refined statistical tools for the reconstruction of the past
              position of tectonic plates and for the assessment of errors in these
              reconstructions.  Specific geophysical phenomena to be studied are the
              deformation of the oceanic lithosphere in the vicinity of spreading ridges
              (Central Atlantic Ocean) and across diffuse plate boundaries (Indian Ocean),
              and the comparison of hot spot reference frames.

This award represents the
              U.S. side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for
              Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses of
              the U.S. investigators and graduate student.  The CNRS will support the French
              researchers' visits to the United States.  Chang will provide expertise on
              statistical methodology.  Royer and Gordon are responsible for collection of
              data and geophysical interpretation.  Their collaboration will advance
              understanding of global tectonic processes and impact on future directions in
              earth sciences.
