This award provides support for funding to collect
              micrometeorites from the South Pole Water Well (SPWW) before it is closed in
              2002.  In 1995, thousands of micrometeorites were collected from the bottom of
              the well and a precise flux and mass distribution for 50-700 micron cosmic
              spherules (melted micrometeorites) for 1100-1500 A.D was determined.  The new
              collection will allow the P.I.s to verify that the central plateau preserves
              the original surface flux of micrometeorites, quantify both melted and unmelted
              micrometeorites for the 400-1100 A.D. time frame, determine the flux for 1-50
              micron interplanetary dust particles (IDP's) and assess whether they are a
              subclass of micrometeorites or derive from different cosmic sources, quantify
              variations (if any) in the flux or compositional distribution of
              micrometeorites on 10-100 year time scales and  recover as many micrometeorites
              from the SPWW as possible.  In addition to micrometeorites, the P.I.s propose
              to collect diatoms, opal phytoliths and terrestrial mineral grains from the
              well.  Such collections will help researchers determine the sources of
              terrestrial particles landing on the Antarctic plateau.  Arrangements have been
              made for Johnson Space Center  (JSC)/NASA to curate the samples and make them
              readily available to researchers in earth and planetary sciences.
