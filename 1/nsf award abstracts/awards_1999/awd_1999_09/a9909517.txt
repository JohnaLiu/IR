This project is a continuation of ongoing research
              into the origins and consequences of continental flood volcanism.  Previous
              work has documented that the peak of volcanic activity during these events
              occurs over geologically brief intervals of 1-3 million years, but the details
              of magma production history are not well known in most cases. This study will
              provide more detailed Ar/Ar and U/Pb geochronologic data aimed at improved
              magma production histories in the Parana-Etendeka, Central Atlantic, and Deccan
              Traps provinces.  Comparison between detailed magma production histories and
              improved biostratigraphic time-scales will further clarify the relations
              between flood volcanism and mass extinctions.  Additional emphasis will be
              placed on dating igneous rocks in these provinces that are clearly associated
              with extensional tectonism, such as dikes swarms, to better constrain the
              relationship between rifting, magmatism, and the eventual formation of ocean
              basins.  A further goal of the project is to better delineate the spatial
              extent of these flood volcanic provinces, some of which overlap aerially with
              others and can be confidently distinguished only on the basis of age. 
              Delineating the extent of the Central Atlantic
Magmatic Province, only
              recently defined despite its widespread occurrence in North and South America,
              Africa, and Europe, is a top priority.
