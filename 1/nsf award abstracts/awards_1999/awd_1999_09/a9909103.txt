Abstract    :
              9909103  Noguera  The objective of research being conducted with support by this
              award is to investigate the microbiology and biochemistry of phosphate removal
              in full-scale wastewater treatment plants as steps toward improvement in
              operation of biotreatment processes for enhanced removal of phosphates from
              wastewater.  Laboratory work involves application of a technique based on
              differences of buoyant densities between cells of microorganisms that
              accumulate phosphates from those that do not accumulate them as a physical
              method for their separation and isolation.  In this work, a procedure will be
              used for visualization of polyphosphate staining in combination with
              fluorescent hybridization to allow simultaneous identification of
              microorganisms and determination of their accumulations of polyphosphates. 
              Results of laboratory-scale research will be correlated with knowledge obtained
              from studies of the microbial phosphorus accumulating communities of wastewater
              treatment plants located in Madison, Stoughton and Racine, Wisconsin.  the
              wastewater treatment plant in Madison uses a modified UCT (University of Cape
              Town) biotreatment process, the Stoughton plant operates an advanced oxidation
              process and the Racine wastewater treatment plant uses a conventional suspended
              microbial growth, non-enhanced biological phosphate removal process.  Results
              of this research are expect to relate knowledge obtained to improvement in the
              engineering design and operation of treatment plants and systems that utilize
              metabolic activities of microorganisms to remove plant nutrients from
              wastewater.  This work is complementary to research being conducted with
              support from NSF Grant No. 9875642, the objective of which is to investigate
              the microbial ecology of nitrogen removal from wastewater by aerated-anoxic
              processes.  ***
