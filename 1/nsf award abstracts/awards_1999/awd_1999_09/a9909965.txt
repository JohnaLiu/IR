This award provides partial support for the U.S.-China
              Workshop on Water Resources Management. 

The workshop was held in Tucson,
              Arizona April 19-22, 1999 in connection with a meeting of the Vice President's
              Form on Environment and Development.  The workshop brought together US and
              Chinese experts on water resources management to explore issues related to
              agriculture, forestry, ecology, industrial and domestic use, and flood and
              drought prediction and mitigation.  Enhanced cooperation with China in the area
              of water resources is an important element of a strategic dialogue on
              environmental and global scientific concerns related to climate and to food
              security.
