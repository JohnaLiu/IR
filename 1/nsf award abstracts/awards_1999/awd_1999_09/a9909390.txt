A recent pilot magnetotelluric (MT) experiment near Tucuman
              across the eastern Andean deformation front concludes that the lower crust is
              as electrically conductive as under southern Tibet.  Common to both areas is
              the rate of crustal strain.  If one can show that high conductivity is an
              inevitable consequence of high strain rate one would have a powerful tool for
              probing active deformation of the deep crust. 
  
In collaboration with
              Argentine colleagues, the investigators are proposing to collect and analyze
              new MT data to (1) Determine whether very conductive lower crust at Tucuman is
              a local or regional feature. (2) Elucidate the transition from resistive to
              conductive crust at the deformation front. (3) Investigate the possibility of
              shallow asthenosphere in the mantle. (4) Compare Tucuman with two distinctly
              different regions of the eastern Andean deformation: (a) San Juan, where the
              crustal strain rate is high, but the subducted slab is very flat and there may
              be no intervening asthenosphere and (b) Cordoba, the most eastern extent of the
              flat slab, where crustal strain islow, but kinematics suggests there ought to
              be an asthenospheric wedge.
