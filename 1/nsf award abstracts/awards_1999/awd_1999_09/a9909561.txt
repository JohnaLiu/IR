Project: Formation of
              Kaolinite in Inorganic and Organic Low-Temperature Systems


Kaolinite is a
              clay mineral that forms in tropical or temperate weathering environments or
              during the burial diagenesis of sandstones and shales.  Kaolinite is mined for
              its properties such as color and light reflectivity, which are important
              characteristics of industrial products such as ceramics and paper coatings.  It
              is a key mineral used to isotopically trace fluid flow pathways and past
              climate change, that alters porosity and permeability in subsurface sandstones,
              and that dominates certain soils. Although natural kaolinite has been
              extensively investigated using surface and microscopic analytical techniques,
              quantitative knowledge of fundamental controls on and rates of kaolinite
              formation at low temperatures is lacking.  In this project, the roles of
              dissolved organic molecules, natural organic materials, mineral substrates,
              solution composition, and temperature in controlling the formation of kaolinite
              will be investigated.  The approach combines well-controlled kinetics
              experiments, full characterization of solutions and solids, and empirical
              molecular modeling of interactions between dissolved ions and organic molecules
              with the mineral surfaces.   Organic molecules will represent soluble humic
              substances and organic exudates from plants and bacteria.  Results will provide
              a rate law for kaolinite nucleation and growth that can be used to model
              natural processes in soils, sediments, and sedimentary rocks and may also be
              applied in the related fields of soils science, petroleum exploration, and
              industrial mineralogy.
