              ABSTRACT

Knowledge of the uplift history of many
              orogenic areas is important paleogeographic reconstructions, paleoclimate
              changes as well as its reflection or proxy for lithospheric thermal structure
              and mantle processes.  However this parameter is quite difficult to measure and
              methods based on geomorphology, paleoflora, sedimentation and isotopic
              fractionation have major uncertainty stemming from using proxies which depend
              on factors other than elevation alone.  This project will refine and apply a
              method that appears to rely on a minimum of such parameters or assumptions and
              should be applicable to areas containing vessicular volcanic flows, a common
              component of orogenic environments.  By measuring the difference between
              vessicle size from flow top to bottom and flow thickness, paleoelevation can be
              calculated.  This method will be applied to the uplift history of the Colorado
              Plateau, which is a source of considerable concern and debate.  Results should
              help resolve between early and late scenarios for uplift of the Colorado
              Plateau and provide a significant test for this method, which will be of wide
              application if successful.
