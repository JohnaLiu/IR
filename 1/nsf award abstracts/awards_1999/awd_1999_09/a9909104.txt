This award provides support for three years for a
              project to develop a radiocarbon chronology for recession of grounded ice from
              the northwestern Ross Sea Embayment (northern Scott Coast) since the Last
              Glacial Maximum (LGM).  A key unresolved question in Antarctic glaciology
              concerns the stability of the marine-based West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS). One
              way to gain insight into present and future stability is to examine its past
              behavior.  In particular, the timing of deglaciation from the LGM position on
              the continental shelf is critical for isolating the mechanisms (sea level,
              climate, ocean temperature, and internal dynamics) that control WAIS dynamics. 
               The northern Scott Coast was likely the first area to become free of grounded
              ice and hence is critical for isolating triggering mechanisms.  Initial retreat
              from the Ross Sea Embayment was thought to have begun as early as 17,000 years
              ago; corresponding to the rise in sea level see in the Barbados coral record. 
              In contrast, recent glacial geologic mapping and relative sea-level work from
              the southern Scott Coast suggests that deglaciation of the Ross Sea Embayment
              was a Holocene event, with southward grounding-line migration past Ross Island
              shortly before 6500 14C yr. B.P.    This chronology suggests that rising sea
              level could not have driven grounding-line retreat to the Siple Coast, because
              deglacial sea-level rise essentially was accomplished by mid-Holocene.  One
              deficiency in the southern Scott Coast work is that it cannot differentiate
              among the possible triggering mechanisms that initiated retreat because it is
              450 km from the LGM grounding-line position.   In this project, relative sea
              level (RSL) curves will be constructed on a transect along the northern Scott
              Coast from accelerator mass spectrometer 14C dates of seal skin and shells
              within raised beaches.  These curves will provide information concerning the
              timing of the uploading of grounded ice from the northwestern Ross Sea
              Embayment.  This study should help to evaluate those factors which could have
              triggered deglaciation and hence controlled the extent of the West Antarctic
              ice sheet  (WAIS).
