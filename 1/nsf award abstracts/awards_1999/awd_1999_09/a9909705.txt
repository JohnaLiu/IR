The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory will develop "Cosmic
              Horizons:  Our Place in Space and Time."  This will be a 5,000-square-foot
              traveling exhibition to help visitors explore the extraordinary recent
              breakthroughs and current mysteries in our scientific understanding of the
              structure and evolution of the universe.  Cosmic Horizons will reach over 3
              million people on its tour of nine to twelve science museums.  A coordinated
              set of programmatic activities and resources for adult and family audiences,
              materials for teachers and students, and on-site workshops for host venues will
              be developed in partnership with Boston's Museum of Science to maximize the
              impact of this space-science education endeavor.
