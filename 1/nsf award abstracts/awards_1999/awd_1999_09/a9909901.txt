This is a proposal requesting consideration for a Small
              Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award.  The proposal describes a one-year
              activity in which the PI will conduct an investigation on spontaneous emission
              control and enhancement in microcavities fabricated from wide bandgap
              III-Nitride semiconductors.  The nature of the epitaxial growth of the
              HI-Nitride such as InGaN exhibited cluster growths that caused broadening of
              the emission spectrum due to random distribution of cluster composition and
              dimensions.  In addition, state filling can occur in such small clusters. 
              Enhanced spontaneous emission rate in microcavities has been shown in other
              material systems such as GaAs.  The proposal is aimed at demonstrations of
              microcavities in III-Nitride system for the enhancement of the spontaneous
              emission for many device applications.
