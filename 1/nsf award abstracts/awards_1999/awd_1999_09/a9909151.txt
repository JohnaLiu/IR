This grant provides Phase II technician support (TS) for
              Michael Cheatham to support operations, maintenance and development of the
              radiogenic isotope lab, stable isotope lab and x-ray fluorescence facility in
              the Earth Science Department at Syracuse University. This support follows three
              years of Phase I support (EAR-9528422) under the Instrumentation and Facilities
              (IF) program.  In the spirit of the IF TS program, the University
              administration has committed itself to underwriting this technician's salary
              for a minimum of two years following expiration of this grant in the event that
              funds from secured research support cannot fully fund the technician's salary. 
              As a result, Cheatham will continue to provide service to Professor's Samson,
              Bickford and Patterson and their students for studies of the evolution of
              continental crust, regional paleoclimatology and environmental isotope
              geochemistry which rely on radiogenic and stable isotopic analytical
              techniques.
