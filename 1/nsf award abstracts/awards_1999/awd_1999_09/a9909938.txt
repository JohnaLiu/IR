This award supports William M. Frank and one or two graduate
              students from Pennsylvania State University in a collaboration with Klaus
              Fraedrich of the Department of Meteorology at the U. of Hamburg, Germany.  The
              project will focus on the study of long-term variations in the Earth's
              hydrological cycle, and will make use of the University of Hamburg's Portable
              Climate Model of the Atmosphere.  The University of Hamburg is one of the
              leading climate modeling centers in the world, and Penn State has a long record
              of excellent work in convection studies, so the collaboration combines
              complementary expertise.  Their topic of study-the interaction of cumulus
              convection and climate-is a key climate issue and should lead to far-reaching
              results of importance to our understanding and modeling of climate and climate
              change.
