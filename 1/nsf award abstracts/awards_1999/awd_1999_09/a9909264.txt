This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in
              materials research involves Leonid Tsybeskov, graduate and undergraduate
              students at the University of Rochester, researchers at the Material Technology
              Laboratory of Motorola, and Christophe Delerue at the Institute for Electronic
              and Microelectronic Research in Lille, France.  The project, supported under
              the joint program of the National Science Foundation and the French National
              Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), is focused on silicon quantum dot
              electronics.  The collaborative research effort involves theorists (Lille),
              materials scientists and applied physicists (Rochester), and industrial experts
              (Motorola).  The Rochester group will conduct experiments on carrier transport
              in nanocrystalline Si superlattices and device prototype development.  This
              will be complemented by theoretical investigations in Lille on nanoscale
              objects and devices.  The Motorola group will serve as industrial mentor to
              this program and focus on the compatibility of manufacturing and
              microelectronic standards.  In addition, scientists at Motorola will help
              establish Si quantum structure metrology, a characterization technique, which
              eventually will be transferred from a university laboratory to an industrial
              fabrication line.
