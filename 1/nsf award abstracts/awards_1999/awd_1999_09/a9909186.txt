Geochemical
              studies have shown that the original isotopic record of carbonate composition
              is preserved in fossil mammal teeth.  The carbon content of fossil teeth
              indicates the plant diet of herbivores and the oxygen indicates ambient
              temperature.  During the late Pleistocene, the fossil horse Equus was very
              widespread throughout North America, and previous studies have shown that it
              was predominantly a grazer.  The goal of this study is to analyze the carbon
              and oxygen content of fossil Equus teeth from widespread localities during the
              Pleistocene to determine changes in N-S latitudinal gradients of C3 and C4
              grass distribution and temperature.  One-thousand isotopic analyses will be
              conducted using either bulk analysis or serial sectioning techniques.  The
              analytical data produced from this study will be integrated with other global
              change parameters through the establishment of a GIS (Geographic Information
              Systems) database.  Results from the last Full Glacial (ca. 20,000 to 15,000
              years ago) will be compared to those of the last Late Glacial (ca. 15,000 to
              10,000).  It is predicted that global latitudinal climatic belts were
              relatively compressed (i.e., more C3 grasses, colder, and more seasonality)
              during the last Full Glacial.  This study will have broad ramifications with
              regard to reconstruction continental-wide paleoclimates and paleoecology during
              the late Pleistocene.
