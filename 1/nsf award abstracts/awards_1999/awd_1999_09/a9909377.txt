Abstract    :
              We propose to continue a GPS-based study of the Rivera and northern
Cocos
              subduction zones using an existing 24 site GPS network in western
Mexico.  Our
              specific goals are to discriminate between the predictions
of
              elastic-slip-at-depth and viscous-flow-at-depth models for
postseismic motion,
              to determine whether postseismic slip decays within a
few years of the
              earthquake and is immediately followed by a resumption
of steady interseismic
              strain accumulation, to assess whether interseismic
strain accumulation is
              focused along parts of the subduction interface
that accommodated the most
              coseismic slip, to determine whether
barriers to the coseismic rupture (e.g.
              velocity-strengthening regions)
correspond to regions of significant
              afterslip, as might be expected if
friction along the subduction fault obeys
              rate- and state-variable
constitutive laws, and to determine whether
              interseismic strain
is consistent with a fully-locked fault, as comparisons of
              expected plate
slip versus coseismically-released slip suggest.  Toward these
              goals,
we will continue annual and continuous occupations of the network,
and
              intensive modeling of postseismic displacements.
