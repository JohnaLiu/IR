Abstract    :
              
This project proposes to develop a method to accurately determine seismic
              energy radiated from large earthquakes, and apply it to study the state of
              stress on subduction-zone megathrusts.  Radiated seismic energy estimates
              provide an important constraint on the state of stress in fault zones. 
              Unfortunately, the determination of radiated seismic energy is subject to large
              uncertainties, and estimates by different investigators can differ by more than
              a factor of 10.  In particular, the values derived from teleseismic data tend
              to be smaller than those determined from regional data, which is believed to
              result from complex source processes and propagation effects.  The research
              will improve the accuracy of energy determination using broad-band data from
              global networks and state-of-art methodology for computing synthetic waveforms
              for realistic source rupture models; both P and S waves will be used, since S
              wave carry more than 95% of the radiated seismic energy.
