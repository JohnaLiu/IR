The formation and evolution of the continents is a
              fundamental problem in tectonics and                   
geochemistry.  Despite
              differences between several current models, the Late Archean is recognized as a
              time of major crustal addition.  One well-recognized process of crustal
              addition is by plate-tectonic-style lateral accretion.  Another calls for
              crustal growth by magmatic addition, in which juvenile components are
              incorporated into magmatic arcs.  This project will attempt to determine the
              relative importance of these two mechanisms in the southern Wyoming Archean
              province.  Considerable current interest in the accretion of continental
              material to the southern edge of the Wyoming province makes the outcome of this
              work important and timely, and results may help understand mechanisms of the
              late Archean accretion pulse generally.
