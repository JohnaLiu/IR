This grant provides partial support for the costs of
              establishing a (U-Th)/He dating facility at Washington State University. The
              PI, Peter Reiners, is a recent addition to the Department of Geology, having
              just completed a postdoctoral program in helium thermochronometry at Caltech. 
              The primary functions of this facility will be to: 1) measure contents of
              radiogenic helium in minerals for applied thermochronologic studies of tectonic
              and geomorphologic processes, and 2) develop and establish new techniques and
              approaches of (U-Th)/He dating in order to expand the method to suit a wider
              variety of phases, closure temperatures, and geologic applications. The lab
              will consist of mineral preparation equipment, apparatus for diffusion
              experiments, a He extraction, purification, quadrupole mass-spectrometry vacuum
              line, and lab facilities for measurement of U and Th contents on the
              department's ICP-MS. The lab will provide thermochronologic capabilities to
              researchers throughout the Pacific northwest, including WSU, Central Washington
              University, the University of Washington, the University of Idaho, and a nearby
              commercial fission-track dating lab (Donelick Analytical). In addition to
              providing thermochronologic constraints to applied studies, this lab will also
              be focused on the experimental development of (U-Th)/He dating in a variety of
              minerals and systems, including economic ore systems.
