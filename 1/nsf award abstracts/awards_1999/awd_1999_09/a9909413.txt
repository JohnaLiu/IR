Order-disorder phenomena play a key role in
              the energetics and crystal chemistry of minerals.  Variation of the cation
              order-disorder distribution in minerals results in changes in their free
              energy, and, therefore phase stability and physical properties, such as
              strength, elastic moduli, and thermal conductivity.  The goal of this proposal
              is to study the cation order-disorder phenomena in mantle minerals at high
              pressure and temperature in order to understand accurately the physical
              properties of the minerals in the Earth interior.  The project will take
              advantage of new developments of the state-of-art in-situ x-ray diffraction
              system with a multi-anvil large volume press and monochromatic synchrotron
              radiation at the X17B beamline of the NSLS.  Crystal structure refinement based
              on the in-situ diffraction data is the major analytical tool.  The minerals to
              be studied include olivine, wadsleyite, orthopyroxene and spinel.  In this
              proposal we focus on the order-disorder distribution between Fe (or Ni) and Mg
              (or Al) cations in these minerals.  The proposed studies will significantly
              improve the detail in information of the physical properties of the minerals at
              the mantle conditions and increase the accuracy of critical physical parameters
              for mantle modeling.
