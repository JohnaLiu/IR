The human genome sequencing project has turned
              the focus of quantitative studies of genomic information from the gathering and
              archiving of genomic data to its analysis and use in prediction and discovery. 
              Key to this new era is work across many disciplinary interfaces, the
              utilization and development of quantitative tools, and the training of
              individuals who are comfortable and equipped to work at these evolving
              interfaces.  With this vision in mind, the La Jolla Interfaces in Sciences,
              LJIS, program will organize and host an event entitled:  "Quantitative
              Challenges in the Post Genomic Sequence Era:  A Workshop and Symposium".  This
              event will be held in San Diego, California.  It will consist of a two day
              workshop, January 11-12, 2000, followed by a three day international symposium,
              January 13-15, 2000.  Complete details are available on the LJIS website,
