This award provides support for two years of
              funding to construct a new record of interplanetary dust accretion, using
              Helium-3 (3He) measurements in polar ice core dust.  The objective is to test
              the hypothesis that the earth's 100,000 year, glacial-interglacial climate
              cycle, a major mode of 
paleoclimate variability, is caused by variations in
              the amount of extraterrestrial dust surrounding the earth.  Previous work has
              shown that measurements of extraterrestrial 3He in ice samples are accurate,
              
reproducible, and well within analytical capabilities.  Virtually all (> 98%)
              of the 3He in dust sample from Greenland and Antarctic ice cores is
              extraterrestrial, based on high 3He/4He ratios and total He budgets.  The
              
inferred extraterrestrial 3He flux, from measurements in recently deposited
              ice, agrees well with estimates based on other methods.  The specific objective
              of the proposed work is to compare variations in 3He flux to both climate
              variations and predicted variations in extraterrestrial flux based from models
              of extraterrestrial dust distribution in the solar system.  Because this is a
              new approach, optimal sample size requirements, size distribution, and
              statistics of 3He-bearing interplanetary dust particles (IDP's) in ice cores
              will also be determined.  This information will be important for models of 3He
              accretion and acquisition by IDP's.
