The Maryland Science Center is developing a large format
              film project on the inner workings of the human body.  The film, to be produced
              in collaboration with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), SDA of
              Canada, and the Science Museum of London, will focus on the daily activities of
              the human body  --  the simple yet astonishing things that happen throughout
              one's body on a single day.  Emphasis will be placed on such everyday events as
              hearing, sneezing, eating, healing, crawling and seeing.  It will be
              complemented by a range of ancillary educational materials including teachers'
              guides, a web site, and a small exhibit for placement in theater lobbies. 
              

The co-Executive Producers for the project are James O'Leary and Greg
              Andorfer, both from the Maryland Science Center; Richard Dale from the British
              Broadcasting System; Alison Roden from the Science Museum of London; and Andre
              Picard of SDA Productions.  Michael Ackerman, Assistant Director for High
              Performance Computing and Communications at the National Library of Medicine of
              the NIH, and Lord Robert Winston, Professor of Reproductive Medicine at
              London's Imperial College, will be the project's principal advisors.  Other
              advisors include:  Harry Chugani, Neurochemistry, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit;
              Susan Greenfield, Neuropharmacology, Oxford University, London; Chris Firth,
