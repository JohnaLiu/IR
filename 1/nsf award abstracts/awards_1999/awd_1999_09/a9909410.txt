The ability to decipher and date multiple thermal events
              in metamorphic terranes would be a major tool in understanding orogenic events
              and paleotectonic settings.  However minerals with moderate closure
              temperatures to radioactive isotopes useful for age determination commonly lose
              some or all of the accumulated time-dependant isotopic products, causing
              ambiguous results, whereas high closure temperatures invite inheritance and
              multiple overgrowths.  This project will explore the utility of using the
              
U-Pb pair in titanite to date polymetamorphic events.  Titanite has a high
              closure temperature with respect to this system, but unlike zircon and other
              accessory minerals, is composed of major components and therefore it can be
              more easily linked to specific metamorphic reactions occurring in a particular
              metamorphic event or phase.  The study will involve petrologic characterization
              of titanite-bearing rocks of New England to determine the causes and ages of
              growth.  These results will be applied to understanding the distribution and
              intensity of the Acadian Orogeny and overprinting by the Alleghanian Orogeny.
