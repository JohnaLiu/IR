This US-Brazil dissertation enhancement research proposal was
              submitted by Ms. Marjorie L. Patrick of the University of California, Irvine,
              under the sponsorship of Dr. Timothy J. Bradley.  Ms. Patrick will work with
              Drs. Adalberto Luis Val and Ruth Ferreira, of  Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas
              da Amazonia (INPA) in Manaus, Brazil.  Ms. Patrick plans to study the ion
              regulatory patterns of mosquito larvae of the Amazon region.
The PI will use
              two habitats that vary in ion composition and pH, the white water river of the
              Amazon River proper and the black water system of the Rio Negro, which is a
              major tributary of the Amazon.  She will use two species from the whitewater
              habitat and two from the blackwater to test whether physiological differences
              contribute to the diversity in habitat preferences observed for different
              freshwater mosquito species.  By studying the relationship between the
              physiology and chemistry of these habitats, we can further our understanding on
              how to control mosquito-borne disease.
Patrick will bring her expertise in ion
              regulatory physiology and field techniques to INPA.  Dr. Ferreria will provide
              her expertise in the biology of the species to be studies.  The Amazon
              rainforest has over 400 species of mosquitoes and a diversity of breeding sites
              with extremes in water chemistry, making it an ideal place to do this
              research.
