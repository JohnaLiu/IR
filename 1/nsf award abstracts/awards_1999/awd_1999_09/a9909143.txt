Abstract    :
              The proposed research will develop tools and methodologies that can be broadly
              applied for conducting integrated assessments of complex environmental issues
              in the United States and in other countries around the world, with specific
              application to Mexico City. The proposal focuses on four critical issues: (i)
              development of  integrated assessment methodologies and tools aimed at using
              the best available data and existing common and accepted models in order to
              produce policy-relevant results; (ii) development of  methods to couple urban,
              regional, and global air pollution models, particularly for aerosols; (iii)
              development of  methodologies to link emissions estimates and policy impacts in
              urban, regional and global contexts for energy, transportation, and industrial
              sectors; and (iv) development of  impact analysis methodologies for tailoring
              health effects damage functions based on composite US data to local conditions
              and demographics for use in policy analysis.
