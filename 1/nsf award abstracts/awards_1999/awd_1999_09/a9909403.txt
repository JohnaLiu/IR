Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research supports the extension of the
              grantees' earlier NSF- and other-agency-supported work delineating the nature
              of the design process.  This grant in particular supports the development of
              overlapping components of a design-in-movement approach to study of design,
              with a special focus on architectural design.  These are a studio-based design
              course addressing the issues of ready-made space and space-in-the-making;  and
              the research, documentation and dissemination of the results of interviews of
              several leading designers.  The research complements the course and documents
              some exemplary failures to achieve space-in-the-making.
