Abstract    :
              This project is to establish a Digital Music Library (DML) testbed. The testbed
              will focus on system architectures, content representation and metadata and
              network services.  Although the 
project will address a wide range of
              multimedia digital libraries issues, it is unique in it's comprehensive
              approach to musical content and the internet - pressing contemporary issues
              capturing 
intense public and commercial interest.  The project will involve a
              large team of interdisciplinary researchers at multiple sites.  There is as of
              yet no comparable digital music library to that presented in 
the proposal. 
              As a digital library system, the DML will provide integrated multimedia access
              to a large corpus of musical material.  As a research and educational resource
              for a large, diverse group of 
communities, the project promises to draw out
              new uses and user needs and stimulate creative activities in many areas.
