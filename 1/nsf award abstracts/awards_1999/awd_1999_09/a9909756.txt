This award supports the participation of American scientists
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Mesoscopic Phenomena on Surfaces, to be held in Park
              City, Utah, in the spring of 2000.  The co-organizers are Professors Ignatius
              Tsong at Arizona State University and Professor Ayahiko Ichimiya at Nagoya
              University in Japan.  Physics and chemistry at mesoscopic length scales produce
              a rich variety of thermodynamic, kinetic, structural, electronic and magnetic
              phenomena.  Engineering on the mesoscopic scale poses serious technical
              challenges.  The purpose of the seminar is to explore fully all the critical
              issues confronting both theory and experiment carried out on mesoscopic
              phenomena that occur on surfaces of solids.  Mesoscopic systems are not
              described well by continuum models and yet are too large for microscopic
              first-principle methods.  These are the issues that require new theoretical
              approaches.  

In view of the continual emergence of exciting new areas in
              this field and its tremendous growth potential in the new century, it is timely
              to hold a topical seminar to discuss the critical issues confronting the study
              and understanding of mesoscopic phenomena that take place on surfaces.  Seminar
              organizers have made a special effort to involve younger researchers as both
              participants and observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese
              experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work,
              and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Dissemination plans
              for the seminar proceedings include publication in the international journal
              "Surface Review and Letters."
