	Support for this research is provided to develop a project
              focusing on agricultural assessment in the Southeastern United States that will
              formally quantify uncertainties in spatial assessments based on dataset sources
              and various methods of spatial scaling of the data sets and various means of
              calibrating and validating crop models over space. The objectives of this
              research are to
1. Evaluate and characterize uncertainties associated with
              alternative input data sources and methods for scaling up crop model
              estimations for regional climate impact assessments;
2. Identify appropriate
              spatial scale matches for observed crop data and the different types of crop
              model input data, and develop methods for aggregating or disaggregating data to
              a given spatial scale;
3. Characterize the errors and uncertainties that
              result when applying spatial data sets and crop simulation models to assess
              regional-scale impacts of climate on agriculture;
4. Provide a validated,
              gridded spatial data base of calibrated soil parameters, daily weather time
              series, representative management inputs, and historical crop yields in the
              Southeast US for climate impact assessment; and
5. Extend and apply these
              methods to another region of agricultural importance, the central Great
              Plains.
