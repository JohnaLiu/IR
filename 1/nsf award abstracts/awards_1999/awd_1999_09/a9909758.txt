This 15-month award will support US participation in a joint
              international workshop on advances in energy studies to take place in La
              Spezia, Italy, in May, 2000.  Mark Brown of the University of Florida and
              Sergio Ulgiati of the University of Siena, Italy, will organize the workshop. 
              The workshop involves US researchers' participation in a forum for a diverse
              group of researchers from the US and Europe to develop opportunities for future
              collaboration on the theoretical basis of energy and resource use and the
              development of policy and management tools to deal with the economy and the
              environment.  The focus of the meeting will be on the evaluation of energy
              sources, environmental and economic constraints, and quantitative and
              qualitative decision making tools.  The broad scope of the meeting will enable
              a multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach.  The ultimate objective is to
              encourage future cooperative research aimed at better understanding the link
              between energy, environment, and the economy.
