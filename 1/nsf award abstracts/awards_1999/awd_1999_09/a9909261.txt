PI plans to continue his laboratory experiments on
              how turbidity currents construct submarine fans.  The work is being done in a
              water-filled basin, 5 m by 5 m in area and 1 m deep, with a false floor onto
              which a suspension of silt-size glass bead sediment, at concentrations of a few
              percent by volume, is introduced as turbidity currents.  Thirty to forty such
              flow events build a large submarine fan, with distinct internal stratification.
               As the deposit builds up, patterns of shifting channels develop on the fan. 
              The next phase of the work will make use of more sophisticated profiling
              equipment to characterize in more detail the stratigraphic architecture of the
              deposit as a function of the flow characteristics of the turbidity currents.
