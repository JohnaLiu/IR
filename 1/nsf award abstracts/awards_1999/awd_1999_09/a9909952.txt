This award supports Frank Pfenning and two students from
              Carnegie Mellon University in a collaboration with Dieter Hutter of the German
              Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) in Saarbruecken, Germany.
               The project will focus on the development of a generic meta-langauge (or
              logical framework) in which various systems for formal reasoning can be encoded
              concisely.  The central objective of this collaboration is to further the
              understanding of how standard techniques of redundancy elimination, efficient
              implementation, and heuristic search from specific logics can be generalized
              and applied to logical frameworks.  Intended applications include formal
              methods and inductive reasoning about programming languages and logics.  This
              work will make possible new advances in software engineering and artificial
              intelligence.
