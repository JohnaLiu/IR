Abstract    :
              The acclaimed Antarctic Bibliography, prepared by the Library of Congress for
              the period 1951-1998, covers all the world's serious nonfiction literature
              regarding Antarctica and the Southern Ocean.  It will be reactivated by the
              American Geological Institute (http://www.agiweb.org/), producer of GeoRef,
              which will work with institutions and scientists worldwide to sustain
              efficiency, completeness, utility, and visibility.  The gap in coverage since 1
              October 1998 is to be closed within 2 years.  The Antarctic Bibliography will
              be available on the web and on CD-ROM.

The bibliography covers the
              scientific, engineering, and operational disciplines pursued by some 27
              Antarctic Treaty nations, including the United States.  AGI's tasks are to add
              new citations and abstracts to the existing database of some 60,000 items, to
              ease availability of full texts of newly cited items, and to seek to improve
              availability of the microfiche file of full texts of items that have been cited
              over the life of the project. The goal is to ease access to the literature in
              order to increase scientists' effectiveness in defining research projects and
              achieving research output and to improve access to research for scientists,
              educators, students, and others.
