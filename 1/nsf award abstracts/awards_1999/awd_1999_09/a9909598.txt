This  proposal  requests  funds  from  the  National  Science
              Foundation  to upgrade and refurbish one of the VG Sector  thermal ionization 
              mass  spectrometers that has been in  service  at  the University of Michigan
              since 1987. The workhorse of two radiogenic isotope  research groups in the
              Department of Geological  Sciences for  over  a  decade,  this mass
              spectrometer  has  the  "Multi-1" collector block with six old-design,
              short-life Faraday cups  that are  moved manually. Because of their advanced
              age and throughput, the  Faraday  detectors  have  suffered  some  damage 
              leading  to degradation  in gain and peak shape. The net result of  this  wear
              and tear is poor precision and reproducibility in the measurements of  Sr  and
              Nd isotopic ratios. In addition, electronic components in the instrument have
              aged and are beginning to impose disruptive downtimes.  Most  critical  of 
              these  are  the  Solatron  digital voltmeters  (DVM's), which are known to
              become temperamental  with age and have been the source of frustrations in many
              other isotope labs.  Solatron  DVM's are no longer manufactured,  and 
              therefore finding adequate parts to fix them has become a problem. In  order to
               lengthen  the service of this mass spectrometer,  the  Faraday detectors, the
              Daly detector and the DVM's need to be replaced  by their more modern
              equivalents, which have superior performance  in stability,  sensitivity  and
              durability.  Modest  funds  are  also requested   to  purchase  a  filament 
              outgasser  for  this   mass spectrometer.  The  mass spectrometer and its
              periphery  equipment are  critically  important  to  the research  of  several 
              faculty members, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students as detailed in the
              proposal.
