"Traditional Knowledge in a Changing Arctic: Gathering,
              Preservation, and Sharing of the Yup'ik 'Way of Being'"

The goals of this
              project are as follows: (1) to document traditional knowledge; (2) to
              disseminate that knowledge within the Yup'ik community and between the Native
              and scientific communities; (3) to provide science training at the local level;
              and (4) to improve communication between Yup'ik people and social and
              physical/natural scientists. The Calista Elders Council, a non-profit
              organization representing the tradition bearers of the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta in
              southwestern Alaska, will coordinate the collection and sharing of information
              on a regionwide basis.
