This award contributes to graduate student participation at
              the 47th Midwest Solid State and Midwest Solid State Theory Joint-Conference to
              be held 15-17 October 1999 at Ohio University. This is an annual meeting hosted
              by a different Midwestern institution each year.  The conference is designed to
              be accessible to graduate students and a broad range of researchers by being
              inexpensive, and by having colloquium level talks and a poster session. The
              goals of this meeting include: bringing graduate students in contact with a
              dynamic scientific community, and bringing together experimental and
              theoretical researchers that are established in the same geographic region for
              intellectual exchange and to spark collaboration.  Topics of special emphasis
              this year are: semiconductor growth, disordered systems, mesoscopics, and
              neuro/bio-physics.
