We propose to continue a GPS-based study of the Rivera
              and northern
Cocos subduction zones using an existing 24 site GPS network in
              western
Mexico.  Our specific goals are to discriminate between the
              predictions
of elastic-slip-at-depth and viscous-flow-at-depth models
              for
postseismic motion, to determine whether postseismic slip decays within
              a
few years of the earthquake and is immediately followed by a resumption
of
              steady interseismic strain accumulation, to assess whether interseismic
strain
              accumulation is focused along parts of the subduction interface
that
              accommodated the most coseismic slip, to determine whether
barriers to the
              coseismic rupture (e.g. velocity-strengthening regions)
correspond to regions
              of significant afterslip, as might be expected if
friction along the
              subduction fault obeys rate- and state-variable
constitutive laws, and to
              determine whether interseismic strain
is consistent with a fully-locked fault,
              as comparisons of expected plate
slip versus coseismically-released slip
              suggest.  Toward these goals,
we will continue annual and continuous
              occupations of the network,
and intensive modeling of postseismic
              displacements.
