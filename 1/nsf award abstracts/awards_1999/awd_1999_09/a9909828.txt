Twin Cities Public TV is producing 13 half-hour programs of a
              new science show for children to be on public television.  The show would be
              based on the children's magazine, "Dragonfly," and would present children doing
              science experiments that they developed and planned themselves.  From time to
              time, the children would be joined by adult scientists who tell of their own
              research, their discoveries, and their love of science.  The goals of the
              project are to foster in children a greater interest in science and the process
              of scientific inquiry; demonstrate the parallels between children's scientific
              explorations and the research conducted by professional scientists; and feature
              and promote science projects involving under-represented communities,
              particularly ethnic minorities and girls.

Outreach for the project will
              include a monthly "Young Investigator's Field Book," a Dragonfly TV teachers'
              companion multi-page insert that will be integrated into the NSTA grade school
              and middle school journals for teachers, and a Dragonfly TV website.  The
              project also will establish community outreach partnerships with the Boys and
              Girls Clubs of America and the 4-H National Science and Technology Network.
