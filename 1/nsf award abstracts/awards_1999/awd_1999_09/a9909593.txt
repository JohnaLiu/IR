This project is a three-year study of the radiative
              characteristics of cirrus clouds and the light-scattering properties of ice
              crystals in the atmosphere at South Pole Station, using a high-resolution
              digital cloud particle imager to automatically classify cloud particles by size
              and shape.  A number of theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated
              that particle size and shape strongly affect the radiative effects of cloud
              particles, and specifically ice crystals.

Two cloud particle imagers will be
              operated in Antarctica in cooperation with an ongoing radiation transfer
              program, with field work to be carried out in the 2000-01 and 2001-02 austral
              summer seasons.  Particle images, concentrations, and size distributions will
              be processed on site and preliminary analyses will be conducted to assure data
              quality.  Current software capabilities of the system allow the rejection of
              artifacts, the computation of various size and shape parameters, of scattering
              characteristics, and of ice/water fraction.  

The individual observations,
              as well as the collective statistics will significantly add to several
              concurrent experiments concerning the emission characteristics of snow, of ice
              crystals in the atmosphere, and of greenhouse gases near the surface.  This
              data, together with measurements of environmental conditions such as cloud base
              altitude, temperature, and humidity structure, will allow the development of a
              climatology of cloud and cloud particle properties, and of new algorithms to
              substantially improve representations of radiation processes in general
              circulation models.
