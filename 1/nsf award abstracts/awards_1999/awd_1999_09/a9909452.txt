The quantitative use of amphiboles for deducing the
              pressures, temperatures, and oxygen fugacities attending metamorphism or
              partial melting in the Earth's crust requires information on iron-rich
              amphiboles.  This proposal will focus on the key iron-rich amphibole
              ferro-actinolite (Ca2Fe5Si8O22(OH)2) using two complementary approaches: (1)
              investigation of ferro-actinolite stability and chemistry in the chemical
              system CaO-FeO-SiO2-H2O, and (2) investigation of the ferro-actinolite
              component in solid solution with the magnesium-rich amphibole tremolite.  One
              particular goal of this research is to synthesize pure iron-bearing amphiboles
              under known pressure, temperature, and oxygen fugacities.  These amphiboles
              will be studied by X-ray diffraction for the purpose of determining the
              distribution of iron and magnesium in the crystal structure of amphibole using
              Rietveld structure analysis and will be studied by Mossbauer spectroscopy to
              further characterize the cation distribution and to see if ferric iron is
              present.  Additional characterization of these extremely fine-grained synthetic
              amphiboles will include analytical transmission electron microscopy to obtain
              direct chemical analyses of individual grains and to assess the amount of
              defects, if any, that are present in their crystal structure.  From this study
              we will gain important insights into the thermodynamic properties of the
              end-member ferro-actinolite, test the hypothesis that ferric iron may greatly
              increase its thermal stability, and determine how iron influences the
              properties of magnesium-rich amphiboles.  This study will provide a valuable
              point of reference for understanding chemically complex amphiboles.
