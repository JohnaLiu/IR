The potential for catastrophic structural failure
              of volcanoes and related hazards implications are now well recognized, but
              apart from a study at Mount St Helens, the mechanisms of collapse are poorly
              understood.  The major edifice failure on Montserrat in December 1997 provides
              an unusual opportunity for a comprehensive analysis of collapse.  The failure
              occurred on the altered south flank of Soufriere Hills volcano, generated a
              debris avalanche that reached the coast, and triggered a volcanic blast.  The
              failure has been well documented, and abundant volcano monitoring data have
              been collected by Montserrat Volcano Observatory; one of us, BV, is a member of
              this organization.  We propose to analyze the deformation and stability of this
              volcano, using powerful computer-modeling tools not used previously in volcano
              analyses.  The study will evaluate realistic models representing gradual to
              sudden collapse, examine the effects of earthquake loading in a rigorous
              fashion, and consider the potential for collapse prediction from monitored
              data.  The results of this study are likely to have a significant impact on
              evaluations of potential structural failure at other volcanoes, with an 
              important bearing on volcano hazard management.
