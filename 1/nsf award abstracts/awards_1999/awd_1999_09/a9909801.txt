The objectives of WISE 2000 is to
              support the participation of two additional engineering students each year in
              the 1999-2001 Washington Internships for Students of Engineering (WISE)
              programs.  The NSF grant will be used to help facilitate the participation of
              students from underrepresented minority groups and currently underrepresented
              engineering disciplines to make the program truly multidisciplinary and
              diverse.

Since 1980, the WISE program has brought up to 18 students each
              summer a total of 279 thus far-to Washington, DC to learn first-hand how
              government officials make decisions on complex technological isssues and how
              engineers contribute to legislative and regulatory public policy decisions. 
              Throughout the ten weeks, the students interacted with leaders in the Congress
              and the Administration, industry, and prominent non-  governmental
              organizations.  Meetings with Congressional committees, executive office
              departments, and corporate government affairs offices were daily activities. 
              In addition, each student researched and completed a paper on a current and
              topical engineering-related public policy issue.
