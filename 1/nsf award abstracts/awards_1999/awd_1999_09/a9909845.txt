Abstract    :
              This proposal describes a novel idea and a new technique to identify intense,
              landfalling hurricanes in the geologic record. It is based on the fact that
              hurricanes produce a large amount of rainfall with a very different oxygen
              isotope composition from that of normal summer rainfall. Hurricane rainfall is
              also isotopically distinct from water in lakes, rivers and streams, groundwater
              and the sea surface. It therefore comprises a natural isotope spike which is
              likely to be incorporated into the calcium carbonate skeletons of aquatic
              organisms. Although the isotope spike in seawater will quickly dissipate
              through mixing and dilution, if incorporated into skeletal carbonate it will
              remain preserved for centuries or even millennia as a record of each
              hurricanes' passage. We predict that the CaCO2 skeletons of massive, long-lived
              corals inhabiting shallow reef in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico contain this
              isotope spike and therefore preserve a record of many of the hurricanes which
              have made U.S. landfall over the past several centuries. We will test this
              prediction by measuring the isotope composition of corals from the Dominican
              Republic, an island hit by several intense hurricanes over the past few
              decades.
