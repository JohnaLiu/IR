Significant residual elevation of ancient mountain
              ranges is difficult to explain, but several examples of elevated mountainous
              topography in long-inactive orogens exist.  This study will investigate the
              suggestion made by the presence of a large volume of post Miocene sediments in
              the Baltimore Canyon that as much as 3 kilometers of material has been removed
              from the New England Appalachians in the last 20 My, despite cessation of
              orogenesis nearly 200 My earlier.  The project involves application of a
              relatively new radiometric technique that has the potential to detect and
              quantify denudation of such magnitude.  Results are expected to test the
              possible recent exhumation in this area and to provide insight into intraplate
              and post-orogenic processes of rock-uplift.
