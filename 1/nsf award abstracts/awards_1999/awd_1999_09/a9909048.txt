Abstract    :
              This project supports the measurement of nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs),
              selected halocarbons, and a number of light alkyl nitrate in whole air samples
              collected aboard the NCAR C-130 aircraft during the Tropospheric Ozone
              Production about the Spring Equinox (TOPSE) experiment. TOPSE will investigate
              the widely observed springtime maximum of tropospheric ozone in the Northern
              Hemisphere Subarctic and Arctic. NMHCs are involved in the photochemical
              production of tropospheric ozone and can directly influence hydroxyl radical
              concentrations. Changes in composition of NMHCs also will be used to diagnose
              oxidation mechanisms and rates over the winter/spring transition.
