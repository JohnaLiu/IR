Title:
              Investigation of Linkages Between Global Climate System Behavior and Regional
              Climate Impacts

This Small Grant for Exploratory Research funds a project
              which involves the design and initial implementation of several demonstration
              projects that identify and quantify the linkages between global climate system
              behavior (including its predictability) and regional climate impacts.  Those
              linkages will be established through the combined use of observational data,
              statistical techniques, and a suite of models, some coupled.  The research will
              be conducted collaboratively by scientists from the University of Oklahoma,
              Texas A&M, and UCSD, SIO.  

This research is important because the regional
              impacts of climate change has large economic and social consequences and
              understanding those impacts and consequences will help deal with their possible
              mitigation.
