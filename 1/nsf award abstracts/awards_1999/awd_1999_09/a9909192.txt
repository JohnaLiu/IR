Abstract    :
              "Response to an Acute Environmental Accident across 
an Ethnically Diverse
              Community"

This investigation explores, in a timely manner, the risk
              perspectives, behaviors and responses of an ethnically and socioeconomically
              diverse community following an acute and significant environmental accident. 
              In March of this year, the Chevron oil refinery in Richmond, California
              experienced a significant explosion and fire in a processing unit for gasoline
              and airline fuel.  Several thousand nearby residents were warned to avoid
              contact with resulting fumes, and more than one-thousand residents visited
              emergency rooms with varying symptoms or complaints.  Recent research
              activities in the city of Richmond, examining risk perspectives and judgments
              prior to the Chevron incident, offers the research team an unusual opportunity
              to compare responses after the environmental accident to baseline or a priori
              beliefs, evaluations and values regarding environmental risk issues.  This
              longitudinal study uses multiple methods to assess how diverse social groups
              within this community respond over time to the recent environmental accident,
              and whether differences on preexisting beliefs and in the framing of risk
              problems predict variability in response to the explosion.  Additionally, the
              study examines the stability of prior beliefs given a significant risk event,
              and considers how these beliefs affect the processing, interpretation of and
              memory for scientific information about a serious environmental accident.
