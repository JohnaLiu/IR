Abstract    :
              This project, funded under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research mechanism,
              is an exploratory study of the polarization pattern of the cosmic microwave
              background radiation at South Pole station in the 1999-2000 austral summer
              season and the following austral winter.  The project involves the installation
              of a new sensor system in an existing telescope, and the development of an
              observing protocol.  
	
The cosmic microwave background radiation is the
              remnant of a cosmological event that occurred approximately 300,000 years after
              the big bang when the expanding and cooling universe could no longer sustain
              undifferentiated plasma.  The on-going, and successful, search for small
              temperature differences in the background radiation (anisotropies) implies that
              the primordial plasma was in fact not totally homogenous, but that differences
              existed, which would have induced gravitational waves whose expression (today)
              exists in the curl of the polarization field of the background radiation.  It
              appears that the analysis of this field is currently the only way of obtaining
              any information about the state of the universe prior to the 300,000-year
              event.

The polarization of the microwave background is an extremely active
              area at the forefront of cosmology with several major investigations under way,
              and has great significance since the results should better constrain the
              fundamental cosmological constants, and define our thinking about the
              evolutionary state of the universe.
