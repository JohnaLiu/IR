Math in the Garden is a collaborative project between the
              University of California's Botanic Garden and 17 organizations around the
              nation that work with underserved urban youth, as well as rural communities. 
              The project will create a series of five (5) guidebooks with activities that
              bring adults and children together in the garden to learn the mathematics
              inherent in the nature of gardening.  The materials and activities will teach
              mathematical concepts and skills, feature plants, flowers, and fruits as math
              manipulatives, promote active learning, and support NCTM and National Science
              Standards.

The guides will organize activities into clusters for various
              times of the year and contain appropriate activities for elementary through
              middle school-aged youth.  Partner organizations will coordinate a trial test. 
              Afterwards, the  formative evaluation will guide the revision and finally,
              national distribution of the guides will be in conjunction with Dale Seymour
              Publishers.  A national Advisory Committee of mathematicians, botanists,
              science educators, math educators, botanical garden staff, and leaders working
              in community gardens has been established.  The entire project will be
              evaluated at every stage of development for its ability to increase math
              skills, garden knowledge, and to encourage young people to engage in active,
              inquiry learning.
