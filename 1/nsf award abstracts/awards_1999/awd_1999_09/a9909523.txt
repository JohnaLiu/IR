Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a study to obtain a high resolution (decadal
              scale) record of drought and/or soil erosion in the mid-western United States
              throughout the Holocene using varved lake sediments. The proponents intend to
              develop a set of magnetic parameters to rapidly characterize the magnetic
              fraction of a sediment sample in terms of mineralogy, concentration and
              particle-size distribution and to identify the key parameters that are
              indicative of eolian and erosional input. To assess accuracy, reliability and
              robustness of our method they will compare their magnetic results for selected
              horizons with more time-consuming sedimentological and geochemical proxies of
              eolian dust and erosion.
