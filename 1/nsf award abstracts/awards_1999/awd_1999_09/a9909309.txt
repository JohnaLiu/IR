Abstract    :
              This project seeks to improve the paleomagnetic record through acquisition of
              precise 40Ar/39Ar age determinations coupled with magnetic measurements of lava
              flows that record in detail the behavior of the geodynamo.  Three problems will
              be addressed: (1) The duration and temporal fine-structure of the
              Matuyama-Brunhes reversal process will be probed using many new
              incremental-heating data from lava flow sequences in Chile, Tahiti, Hawaii, and
              Washington that apparently were erupted at different times during the reversal.
              (2) Five volcanic areas in the southern hemisphere will be developed as new
              recording sites in a globally balanced array designed to measure paleosecular
              variation of the magnetic field over the past 5 million years.  The new
              geochronology will play an important role in determining the periods and
              polarity states recorded by the lavas essential to modeling time-averaged
              behavior of the magnetic field.  (3) The frequency, timing, duration, and
              geographic extent of reversal attempts are important observational constraints
              on modeling the geodynamo.  Accordingly, we will expand efforts to verify the
              timing and geographic extent of at least three polarity events or subchrons in
              the late Matuyama chron.  These include the recently proposed Punaruu (1.10 Ma)
              and Santa Rosa (0.92 Ma) events, and the Kamikatsura event (0.90 Ma).  Laser
              fusion and incremental-heating of sanidine phenocrysts from silicic lava flows
              in New Mexico and California will provide the needed age resolution and spatial
              coverage.
