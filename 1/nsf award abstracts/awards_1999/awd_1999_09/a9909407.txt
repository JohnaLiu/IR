Abstract    :
              This starter grant award of the Special Projects Office of the Chemistry
              Division supports the research of Professor Andrew L. Feig at Indiana
              University.  The theme of the research is the development of a new methodology
              for observing metal binding to nucleic acids based on circular dichroism
              spectroscopy.  In particular, the role that Mg2+ ions play in RNA biochemistry
              will be examined.  Spectroscopic examinations of two small RNAs will be
              compared to kinetic studies that have probed metal binding.

Metal binding to
              RNAs is essential for biological activity.  One of the applications of this
              project is insight into the mechanisms of RNAs with catalytic activity. 
              Ultimately, the methods developed here can be used to study a wide variety of
              structural changes and other dynamic processes in proteins and nucleic acid
              molecules.
