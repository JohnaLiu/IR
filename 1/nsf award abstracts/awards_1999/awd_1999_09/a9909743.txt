Abstract    :
              This award will continue the operation of a Fabry-Perot interferometer at South
              Pole for the purpose of measuring temperature and winds in the neutral
              atmosphere in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere (~100 Km altitude). 
              The relative simplicity of the atmospheric conditions at the Pole makes it an
              ideal place to learn more about the mechanisms that drive the dynamical
              behavior of the upper atmosphere.  At lower latitudes, the diurnal effects of
              heating and cooling and changes in the ionization caused by sunlight make the
              dynamical situation very complex; whereas, at the Pole these confounding
              effects are absent.  Therefore, by comparing the two regions the global effects
              can be separated from the large daily signals.  During the period of operation,
              the Thermospere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED)
              satellite will be launched, and the South Pole measurements will complement
              those of the spacecraft.
