Abstract    :
              This research project will advance the science of integrated assessment through
              a regional study focusing on human adaptation to climate change, petroleum
              development, and tourism in the Arctic.  A research team consisting of natural
              and social scientists in partnership with stakeholders from Native American
              communities on the North Slope of Alaska and Canada are examining the effects
              of global change on the size and availability of the Porcupine Caribou Herd, as
              well as other herds, and the potential impacts on communities depending on
              caribou for subsistence.  The team will also expand the caribou sustainability
              research to examine the important issues surrounding sustainability of marine
              resources important to coastal communities.  By involving stakeholders in the
              research the team will continue to utilize the traditional knowledge of Native
              Americans as a research tool and to examine the policy implications of the
              integrated assessment method in the local community.  This approach will
              improve the information value of integrated assessment modeling.
