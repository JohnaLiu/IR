Workshop: Riparian Zones: Functions and Strategies for
              Management

Riparian zones are land areas adjacent to waterways that are
              intricately related to water quality and quantity and to the structure and
              functioning of aquatic ecosystems. The importance of riparian zones has been
              understood for some time and there has been a flurry of interest more recently
              that relates to land-use issues and water quality. In addition, interest in
              riparian zones has included biodiversity maintenance. In this project, the
              National Academy of Sciences will undertake the study of riparian zones to
              describe the nature and functioning of riparian zones and assess the condition
              and trends of riparian habitats with respect to their hydrological and
              ecological structure and functioning. The study will also review criteria for
              improved management and mitigation of adverse impacts and the decision-making
              necessary for the best use of these lands.
