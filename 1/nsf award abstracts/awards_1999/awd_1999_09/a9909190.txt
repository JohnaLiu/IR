Abstract    :
              This award will continue the development of Howard University's effort in
              atmospheric sciences by establishes Howard's participation Howard's
              participation in the Unidata community through Howard University Program in
              Atmospheric Sciences (HUPAS) and the Center for the Study of Terrestrial and
              Extraterrestrial Atmospheres (CSTEA).  Specifically, the acquisition of a data
              server is proposed to upgrade an existing student computer laboratory, and as a
              result enable participation in Unidata's Internet Data Distribution system.
