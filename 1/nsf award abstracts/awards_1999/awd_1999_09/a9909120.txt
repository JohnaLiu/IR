The paleogeographic positions of the Carolina terrane,
              including the timing of its accretion to Laurentia, are poorly constrained. 
              This study will determine the age distribution of detrital zircons from clastic
              sedimentary rocks within the Carolina terrane and compare the age groups with
              known ages of orogenic belts from various cratons.  Detrital zircons from
              sandstones of three different ages, including Neoproterozoic, Cambrian, and
              Ordovician, will be examined to determine if any fundamental changes in age
              distributions occur that can be correlated to different paleogeographic
              positions.  The ages of detrital zircons from Ordovician sandstones will be
              used to test the hypothesis that the Carolina terrane was in close spatial
              association with the eastern Laurentian margin in mid-Ordovician time and had
              accreted to Laurentia by the end of the Ordovician.
