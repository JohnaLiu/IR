Abstract    :
              This award is for support for one year of funding to produce a dated record of
              the late Pleistocene highstand and subsequent retreat of the Lambert Glacier
              and its tributaries in East Antarctica.  These glaciers comprise one of the
              largest outflow systems in the East Antarctic ice sheet, draining ~ 10% of its
              area.  Cosmogenic isotopes will be used to date boulders from glacial maximum
              moraines and younger retreat moraines at two sites; on the Lambert Glacier at
              the Mawson Escarpment, and on the Fisher Glacier, at Mt Menzies.  These sites
              were mapped and sampled in 1997/98.  The goal of this study is to produce an
              ice-surface reconstruction of the Lambert Basin from the last glacial maximum
              to present.  In particular, dating the moraine sequence in the Mawson
              Escarpment will constrain the surface lowering history of the Lambert Glacier
              itself, indicating whether this giant outlet glacier withdrew rapidly or
              gradually from its glacial maximum position.  This work will complement
              evidence from marine studies in Prydz Bay and will allow comparisons to be made
              with the deglaciation of the Ross Sea region.  The reconstruction will also
              help to define the ice loading history of the Lambert Basin for isostatic
              rebound modeling and geodetic studies.
