Abstract    :
              This project will utilize data from several different satellites along with
              transport models of energetic particles to determine the source region for the
              energetic electrons that create the radiation belts during magnetic storms.  In
              addition, the modeling effort will examine the processes by which the electrons
              are energized.  This proposal is linked to a companion proposal from the
              University of California, Berkeley, (ATM99-09358, M. Temerin, PI).
