This project seeks to link
              theoretical models for low-mass star formation with observational data. 
              Three-dimensional radiation transfer codes will be developed which attempt to
              take into account that the process of star formation involves extremely
              non-spherical geometry such as rotationally-modulated collapse to flared disk
              structures, as well as bi-polar outflows.  Several existing theories describing
              this process will be tested and compared to the newest high-resolution
              mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy data that are now available.  In previous
              work, it has been assumed that the spectral energy distribution of a pre-main
              sequence star indicates a unique evolutionary state. The new computed models
              will combine imaging, polarization and spectral energy distributions to test
              this hypothesis, with particular emphasis on identifying the most relevant: 
              (1) infall scenarios; (2) observational signatures of the current paradigm, the
              magnetic accretion model;  (3) dust properties in the circumstellar
              environment; and (4) binary formation processes.
