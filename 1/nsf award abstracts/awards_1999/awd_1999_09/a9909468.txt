Most of the methods currently used for studying the
              magnetic properties of natural and synthetic materials only provide information
              about the average size of the magnetic grains. The investigators are developing
              a new method that will actually provide information about the size distribution
              of the magnetic grains.   This information is contained in contour plots
              (called FORC diagrams) that are generated from a set of partial hysteresis
              curves. Preliminary results indicate that it is possible to characterize a wide
              range of samples using FORC diagrams and to identify and discriminate between
              the different types of assemblages that have the same average grain size. The
              goals of this project are 1) to develop a simple and rapid means of producing a
              FORC diagram so that the method can be more widely used, and 2) to demonstrate
              how FORC diagrams can solve problems that can not be easily solved using other
              techniques.
