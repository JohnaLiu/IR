Abstract    :
               

This proposal requests NSF a block travel grant of $40,000 to support 12
              educators and researchers from USA to participate in the second
              Japan-USA-Vietnam workshop on Research and Education in Systems, Computation
              and Control Engineering to be held in HoChiMinh City in Vietnam, June 7-9,
              2000.   This workshop follows the successful first workshop in Hanoi in 1998,
              where we recognized the need of continuing the workshop until the relation
              between Vietnam, Japan and USA matures to the stage where exchange programs and
              collaborations become easily accessible to students, researchers and educators
              of all the three nations. The second workshop serves as a milestone of our
              efforts toward that common goal by bringing together educators and researchers
              from these three countries to study and discuss ways of integrating research
              and education in systems, computation and control engineering. The Engineering
              Systems Research Center (ESRC) at UCB will administer the distribution of
              funds.
