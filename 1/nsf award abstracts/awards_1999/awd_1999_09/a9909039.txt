This award to the Polytech
              University awards funds to plan the feasibility of establishing an
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Biocatalysis and
              Bioprocessing of Macromolecules (BBM).  A planning meeting will be held to
              finalize the research program and to assess company interest to participate. 
              Industrial members will be recruited, and the structure and operation of the
              Center will be finalized.
