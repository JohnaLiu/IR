Abstract    :
              The proposed work is an addition to a four-year study of the sulfur chemistry in
              the antarctic atmosphere, including two summer field seasons at South Pole
              station, one in 1998-99 and the second to occur in 2000-01. Investigations of
              Sulfur Chemistry in the Antarctic Troposphere (ISCAT) is a major project,
              involving ten principal and senior investigators at five institutions with
              seven additional contributing investigators.
	
During the 1998-99 field
              season ISCAT scientists found levels of reactive nitrogen in the atmospheric
              boundary layer at South Pole station that greatly exceeded levels predicted
              from standard gas phase tropospheric chemistry models.  Since it is highly
              unlikely that these nitrogen species could have been transported in from lower
              latitudes, it was supposed that there is a local source within the antarctic
              snow cover.  This supposition has enormous consequences because it means that
              the snow does not act as a simple accumulator and integrator of atmospheric
              trace gases, and that observed concentrations in snow and ice cores cannot be
              simply taken as reflecting atmospheric conditions at the time the snow was
              falling.
	
In the 2000-01 season the observational protocol of ISCAT will
              include an expanded nitrogen oxide chemistry.  Nitric and nitrous acid will be
              measured both in the atmosphere and in the snow, with the reduced data
              available in near-real time to guide the ISCAT observational program.
