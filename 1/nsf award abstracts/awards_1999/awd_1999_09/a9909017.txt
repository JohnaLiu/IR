Abstract    :
              This project explores the synthesis and properties of polythioether macrocycles
              which have considerable potential use as ligands for transition metal ions. 
              Historically, these molecules have been difficult to make.  However,  new
              procedures for synthesizing these molecules have recently been discovered. 
              These procedures center around a metal-catalyzed ring opening reaction of
              smaller sulfur-containing molecules in which the metal can act as a template
              for construction of the cycle.

With this Award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Richard D.
              Adams of the University of South Carolina.  The research project that Professor
              Adams will conduct under the auspices of this Award involve the creation of
              molecules that are molecular rings and in which sulfur atoms are placed at
              regular intervals.  Such molecules interact with metals as though they were a
              crown of thorns, with the sulfur atoms connecting the crown to the metal.  In
              this way the properties of the metal are modified, potentially in such a way
              that the usefulness of the metal in chemical reactions is enhanced.
