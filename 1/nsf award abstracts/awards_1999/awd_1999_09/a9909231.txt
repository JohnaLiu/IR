Eurasia comprises several major cratonic blocks
              separated by mobile belts which cover about half of the continent.  While
              phanerozoic motions of the major blocks are relatively well defined, the
              tectonic evolution of Eurasia's older mobile belts remains enigmatic.  This
              project involves paleomagnetic and geologic studies to determine the motions of
              major units of Kazakhstan.  Results should help resolve past position of such
              terranes as the Ural-Mongol belt, tarim and other blocks involved in the late
              paleozoic evolution of Eurasia.
