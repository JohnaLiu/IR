U.S. Participation in GCTE Focus 3 Conference
              "Food and Forestry - Global Change and Global Challenge"

This project will
              support U.S. participation by four senior scientists and three early-career
              scientists in workshops associated with the Global Change and Terrestrial
              Ecosystems (GCTE) conference on food and forestry to be held in Reading,
              England on 20-23 September 1999. The workshops are entitled:
o    Effect of
              agricultural intensification on trace gas emissions
o    Linking ecosystem and
              economic models at regional scale
o	Developing or modifying crop production
              models to simulate losses due to pests and diseases under global change.
The
              conference objective is to develop research agendas for two broad areas: 1) the
              environmental consequence of increasing food, fiber and fuel supply, and 2) the
              affect of climate variability on production systems and environmental
              degradation. In particular, the organizers wish to bring a more effective focus
              on the interactions between ecosystems - particularly agroecosystems - and
              elements of global change.
