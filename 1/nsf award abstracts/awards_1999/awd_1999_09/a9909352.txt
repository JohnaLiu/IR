Abstract    :
              This project proposes to perform a detailed investigation of the 1994 Java
              earthquake and its larger aftershocks, by using seismsc waveforms and other
              geophysical and geological datasets.  The 1994 Java earthquake was a large
              shallow subduction zone thrust-earthquake that was followed by a tsunami. 
              Preliminary work shows a large discrepancy between the short period and long
              period behavior of the main shock in terms of moment rate and directivity.  The
              aftershock sequence is highly unusual because of the normal faulting nature of
              almost all of its mechanisms, in contrast with the thrust main shock mechanism.
               By performing source inversions for the Java events, determining a detailed
              rupture model of the main shock, relocating aftershocks, investigating the
              origin of the aftershock pattern, and combining these seismic observations with
              tectonic datasets to develop a model of this unusual event, this project will
              be able to significantly enhance the understanding of how shallow subduction
              zones work.
