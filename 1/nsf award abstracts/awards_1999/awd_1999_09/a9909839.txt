The buried Chicxulub impact crater on the Yucatan
              Penninsula in Mexico is scientifically important because of its great size
              (>200 km), its excellent preservation state, and its link to the
              Cretaceous-Tertiary extinctions.  The International Continental Scientific
              Drilling Program (ICDP) has agreed to provide funds to drill and continuously
              core a 2.5 - 3 km hole in the crater, assist in initial core documentation
              operations, and conduct a basic logging program.  There are three Principal
              Investigators for the Chicxulub Scientific Drilling Project (CSDP) - two
              Mexican scientists and the author of this proposal, Virgil Sharpton.

This
              award provides funding for the development of a science program with U.S.
              participation.  Specifically, funds will be used to: 1)  assemble members of
              the Science Team through a call for short proposals in Eos and GSA Today; 2) 
              meet with other PIs, Co-PIs, and representatives from other relevant
              institutions and agencies to plan and implement a science plan; and 3) prepare
              the proposers' effort in CSDP by continuing analysis of existing samples from
              the Mexican-led campaign of shallow coring along the southern flank of the
              Chicxulub basin.
