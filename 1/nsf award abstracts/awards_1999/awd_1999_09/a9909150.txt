Under tectonically stable conditions continental cratons
              are expected to have a positive relief with respect to average sea level and
              with respect to oceanic crust.  Dynamic topography is also a reflections of
              underlying mass, density and thermal structure.  Recent analysis of Nd isotopic
              signatures of Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments from North America has suggested
              that sediments deposited on the Canadian Shield in conjunction with paleozoic
              orogenies were not eroded to expose the basement shield rocks for as much as
              300 My afterwards, a result incompatible with existing models of large-scale
              continental freeboard.  This study will examine and unbroken succession of
              sedimentary rocks in the Sverdrup Basin of Canada that spans the Pennsylvanian
              to Late Cretaceous to attempt to detect when shield basement rocks first
              contributed sediment.  Confirmation of very long negative relief of the
              Canadian Shield will have considerable impact on models of continental
              freeboard and the thermal structure of the mantle during this time interval.
