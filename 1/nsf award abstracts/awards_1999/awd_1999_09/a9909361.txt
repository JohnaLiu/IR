A new analytical protocol will be applied to
              separate biological markers in ancient sediments and oil in order to make
              reliable d13C measurements.  The proposed studies will improve understanding of
              bulk carbon isotopic excursions, water stratification, atmospheric CO2 budget
              and ecological changes, especially at mass extinction events.  Initial targets
              for study will include rock sequences around the Late Ordovician (Ashgillian)
              mass extinction event, the Ordovician (Caradocian) isotopic excursion, and an
              oil survey that will provide broad new knowledge about global
              paleoenvironmental conditions at times when organic rich rocks were
              deposited.
