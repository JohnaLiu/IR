Superlattices and quantum wells were introduced 29 years ago
              to widen the choice of materials for electronic and optoelectronic devices. 
              Unlike compound semiconductors, lacking a suitable barrier material for silicon
              has prevented silicon to play an important role in new quantum devices.  The
              discovery of epitaxial growth beyond an adsorbed disordered monolayer of oxygen
              has opened the door to a new type of superlattice, Si/O superlattice.  The
              previously observed electroluminescence originates from e-h recombination from
              holes generated by e-h pair generation in the deep depletion of the silicon
              substrate.  This proposed study involves the replacement of the Schottky
              barrier by p-n junction so that both electrons and holes are injected into the
              active Si/O superlattice region.  Moreover, pulsed operation and lifetime
              measurements will be carried out.  Therefore, the frequency response of the
              electro-luminescent LED can be established.  The potential impact of the
              project may serve as a quantum jump in the future silicon optoelectronic
              devices.
