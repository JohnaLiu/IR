This award supports Thomas Gallagher and students from the
              University of Virginia in a collaboration with Ulrich Eichmann of the Division
              of Laser Fields and Excited States at the Max Born Institute in Berlin,
              Germany.  The project will investigate the effects of valence-electron
              correlations in two-valence electron atoms exposed to intense laser pulses. 
              The two groups will carry out experiments which will clarify the physics of
              multiphoton processes in two-electron atoms.  In particular, they will
              investigate inner electron ionization and double ionization from prepared
              doubly excited states.  Both groups are positioned to attack this problem using
              differing and complementary approaches.  Beyond that, the collaboration should
              lead to entirely new ways of approaching the problem of multiphoton
              ionization.
