Abstract    :
              
The PI proposes to perform supplemental data analyses on a 5-km line of
              combined seismic reflection and refraction data collected by the USGS near
              Parkfield, California.  The 1998 Parkfield survey used acquisition parameters
              appropriate for imaging reflections from steeply dipping structures, such as
              the near-vertical San Andreas Fault, and data plots from the experiment
              demonstrate the existence of the expected type of fault-plane reflections.  The
              PI will employ prestack migration to create the first-ever seismic reflection
              image that includes a major near-vertical strike-slip fault as a reflector. 
              The image to be produced by this proposal will directly constrain location and
              potentially internal properties of the fault zone in the upper 1 kilometer of
              the crust.
