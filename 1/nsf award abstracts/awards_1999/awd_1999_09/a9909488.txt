One of the most provocative - yet largely untested - recent
              hypotheses concerning orogenic evolution is that regional variations in climate
              strongly influence spatial variations in the style and magnitude of deformation
              across an actively deforming orogen.  Recent progress in quantifying rates of
              both tectonic and geomorphic processes and in modeling surface and lithospheric
              processes sets the stage for an integrated, quantitative, field-and model-
              based investigation of the interactions and feedbacks between geomorphic,
              climatic, and tectonic processes.  This project involves an examination of
              these interactions where they are likely to be most clearly expressed:  the
              Nepalese Himalaya.  Not only is this the quintessential colloisional orogenic
              belt, but its topographic growth and erosional history have been suggested as
              key controls on global climatic changes.  The integrated study focuses on a
              major transverse catchment, stretching from the edge of the Tibetan Plateau to
              the foreland and traversing some of the highest topography in the world.  This
              transect spans the major structural elements of the Himalaya, as well as
              monsoon-to-rainshadow climatic conditions.  The Principal Investigators bring
              together expertise in process-based geomorphology, glaciology, climatology,
              structural geology, thermochronology, cosmogenic radionuclide dating, modeling,
              and documentary film making for a multi-pronged approach intended to evaluate
              one overarching, but largely untested hypothesis:  Rates of erosion vary
              spatially as a function of climate and this spatial variability in erosion
              controls the partitioning of deformation within an orogen.
