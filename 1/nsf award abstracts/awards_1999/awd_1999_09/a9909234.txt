A combined
              theoretical and numerical simulation approach will be undertaken to study
              macroscopic behavior based on microstructure of three two-phase flow systems:
              bubbly liquids at large Reynolds numbers and finite Weber numbers, sheared
              suspension of coalescing drops, and suspension of bidisperse particles at high
              concentrations.  A method for computing Laplace and Stokes interactions in
              which the computational effort increases only linearly with the number of
              bubbles or particles in suspension will be extended for these situations.  The
              large Reynolds number simulation with deformable bubbles (finite Weber numbers)
              will extend the previous results for non-deformable bubbles characteristic at
              small Weber numbers.  Drop coalescence induced by flow is considered within
              drop suspension shear flows.  The mixture properties of bidisperse suspensions
              will be investigated over a wide range of particle size ratios.  If successful,
              the predictive methodology will lead to design methods of various multiphase
              systems with potential application in processing industries.
