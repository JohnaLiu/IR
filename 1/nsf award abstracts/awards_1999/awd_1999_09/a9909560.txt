A large-body impact at the Cretaceous-Tertiary (KT) boundary
              targeted 3 km of carbonate platform covering crystalline basement on the
              Yucatan peninsula.  This study seeks to reconstruct the sediment transport
              dynamics and geochemistry of the KT impact by analyzing ballistically ejected
              carbonate sediments deposited close to the Chicxulub crater.  The age, source,
              transport mechanisms, and post-depositional alteration of these deposits will
              be reconstructed from a well-exposed platform top section at Albion Island,
              Belize.  Accretionary lapilli interpreted to be of impact origin will also be
              analyzed from the platform margin El Guay section in Mexico, The genesis of
              these impact-derived sediments will be determined using cathodolumineseence
              (CL) petrography, elemental and isotopic geochemistry (bulk rock and
              microsamples), and quantitative water-rock interaction modeling.  Preliminary
              analyses have identified several CL-distinct crystalline features in the
              lapilli and breccia blocks that will provide important new constraints on vapor
              cloud sedimentary mechanisms and geochemistry.  Tests will be conducted to
              determine whether symmetrical trends in global seawater 87sr/86 Sr standard
              curve (0.7077 to 0.7079) through the KT boundary can be used to determine: (1)
              the depositional age of original sedimentary components (breccia blocks,
              lapilli, skeletal material, marine cements), and (2) syndepositional or early
              post-depositional events of impact glass
