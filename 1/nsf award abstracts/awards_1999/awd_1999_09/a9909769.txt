Ignimbrite flare-ups are explosive outpourings of magma
              that occur at convergent margins. Ignimbrite episodes are of fundamental
              importance in understanding the environmental impact of large scale explosive
              volcanism, the potential for volcanic hazards, and the geochemical cycling at
              subduction zones. The record of ignimbrite episodes is well preserved as
              volcanic ash fall layers in marine sediments. Recent drilling of ODP Leg 165 in
              the Caribbean recovered an exceptional 76 m.y.-long sequence with over two
              thousand ash fall layers. Two major explosive volcanic episodes - one of
              mid-Miocene and the other mid-Eocene age -  originate from the Central American
              volcanic arc, where voluminous silicic ignimbrites were erupted in Nicaragua,
              Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.  This is a two-year project to address the
              nature of explosive volcanic episodes, or ignimbrite flare-ups, using the
              Central American and Caribbean deposits as a primary example. The principal
              objectives of the research are to 1) assess the frequency and nature of
              explosive events by using a high resolution chronostratigraphy, 2) characterize
              the composition and volatile content of a representative suites of tephra
              layers from the main volcanic episodes by using electron microprobe and ICPMS
              laser ablation analysis of glasses and minerals;  3) model the transport and
              deposition of ash layers, and 4) collect and analyze samples from major
              ignimbrite deposits in Nicaragua and Honduras to begin to build up a
              geochemical database with which to integrate the marine and terrestrial
              records.    The results of the study will provide important new information on
              the frequency of large-scale explosive eruptions in Central America during the
              Cenozoic, the production rate of silicic magma and aerosol-forming volatiles
              during major episodes of explosive volcanism and their potential impact on
              global climate, and the volcanological nature of individual source eruptions
              and their influence on tephra dispersal and deposition.
