Abstract    :
              Ths project will rigorously test models describing grvity waves and their
              interaction with chemical processes and associated nightglow in the mesosphere,
              using extensive, high-quality data derived from the Starfire and Meso-D
              campaigns.  The PI has already progressed considedrably in modeling the effects
              of gravity waves on the distributions of minor species in tghe mesosphere/lower
              thermosphere region, and of subsequent perturbations in thed airglow emissions
              involving these minor species.  In addition, he has developed a realistic
              full-wave model describing gravity wave propagation in an inhomogeneous
              atmosphere.  The chemical/nightglow perturbation model has been linked with
              their  full-wave model to provide a powerful tool for exploring gravity wave
              interactions with chemical and nightglow processes.  However, he was required
              to make assumptions in simulations that couldn't be tested due to lack of
              corroborative measurements.  With the Starfire and Meso-D data sets, the PI
              will perform realistic simulations of observed nightglow fluctuations by
              incorporating realistic background winds and temperature profiles in the model.
               This will provide a unique opportunity for the PI to further characterize
              waves and their effects in the region by quantitatively evaluating the
              energetics of the waves, evaluate the forcing of the mean state by the waves,
              and elucidate the coupling between tghe upper and lower atmosphere.
