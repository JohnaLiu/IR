We propose to investigate the tectonic processes
              occurring in the deep lithosphere of the SW US through studies of mantle
              xenoliths erupted along an E-W transect from the Sierra Nevada to the Colorado
              Plateau. Petrography, mineral and major element chemistry, thermobarometry and
              Re-Os isotopic compositions will be determined for several suites of mantle
              xenoliths from the Sierra Nevada mountains (Big Creek and Oak Creek), the Basin
              and Range (Cima volcanic field) and the Colorado Plateau (the Thumb). This
              traverse samples Proterozoic crust that has been subjected to diverse tectonic
              influences:  arc magmatism (Sierra Nevada), compressional tectonism (Colorado
              Plateau) and back-arc extension (basin and range).  The goal is to map the
              lithospheric mantle in these diverse regions in order to determine the present
              day thickness and age of the lithosphere.  These data will then be integrated
              with surface geology and geophysical remote sensing of lithospheric structure
              to infer the processes that have shaped the deep lithosphere.
