This project is a continuation of MIT's collaboration
              with international partners to define plate motions and intra-plate
              deformations 
in the eastern Mediterranean region using the Global Positioning
              System 
(GPS).  This work will follow three principal directions, including,
              1) 
continuing to use GPS to monitor deformation in the zone of interaction of
              
the Arabian, African, and Eurasian plates with a focus on specific tectonic
              
features such as triple junctions, active faults, and the eastern
              
Turkey/Caucasus collision zone, 2) incorporating other geological and
              
geophysical information to determine the relationship between present-day
              
deformation and deformation on geologic time scales, and to characterize
              
the principal forces driving deformation and the physical nature of the
              
lithosphere responding to these forces, and 3) developing detailed
              
numerical models to test alternative hypotheses.  It is anticipated that this
              
research will add substantially to our understanding of the basic
              
principles that govern continental deformation in zones of active plate
              
interactions, and will provide an improved physical basis for estimating
              
and mitigating future earthquake hazards.
