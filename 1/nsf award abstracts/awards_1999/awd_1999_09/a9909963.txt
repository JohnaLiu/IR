This award supports Susanne Stemmer from Rice University  in
              a collaboration with Christian Ruessel of the Department of Glass Chemistry at
              the University of Jena, Germany.  The collaboration studies the titanate family
              of molecules, such as barium titanate, which have attracted attention recently
              for many important applications such as information storage devices or tunable
              microwave devices.  Techniques that provide information about the distribution
              of defects within these microstructures are currently lacking.  The cooperative
              work funded here will develop a method to quantify the point defect chemistry
              and dielectric properties of titanates almost down to the atomic level by means
              of electron energy-loss spectroscopy.  The project benefits from synergy of
              expertise in defect-property relationships of multicomponent oxides and
              expertise in the synthesis of oxides from highly reduced melts.  The research
              will also benefit from sharing characterization facilities and
              materials-synthesis facilities.
