One of the most fundamental questions in Earth
              sciences is how the geomagnetic field is generated and is able to reverse
              polarity. During the last few years considerable effort has been devoted to the
              acquisition of records of the short transitional periods during which the field
              reverses polarity. Thus, today one of the most exciting geophysical
              measurements being made is the detailed recording of the Earth's magnetic field
              in transitions between polarities. Much of the current interest in geomagnetic
              field reversals is concentrated on documenting the detailed field behavior
              during polarity reversals in order to constrain the various models of the
              geomagnetic dynamo. Detailed polarity transition records are necessary in order
              to understand the reversal processes generated in the Earth's core. The
              investigators propose to study volcanic records of three successive polarity
              transitions located in two different sections found in the Wai'anae volcano,
              O'ahu, Hawaii. These reversals are the Upper Mammoth (R-N), the Lower (N-R) and
              Upper Kaena (R-N). In this one-year project, the investigators will drill both
              sections, perform the necessary paleomagnetic and rock-magnetic laboratory
              measurements, and complete analysis and interpretation of the results. This
              detailed study of the transitional behavior of the paleofield of those
              reversals will also serve as the basis for the construction of the
              magnetostratigraphy of the Wai'anae volcano. The results will provide insight
              into the paleofield behavior from the Gilbert-Gauss to the Upper Kaena
              reversals and their relationship to the geodynamo.
