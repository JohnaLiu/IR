Abstract    :
              Tobin  9909270 


In crustal faults such as the San Andreas and subduction
              zone megathrusts, anomalous seismic velocity, seismic reflectivity, and
              electrical conductivity have been interpreted as signatures of fluid content,
              pore pressure, fault gouge presence or composition, and damage zone effects. 
              However, the relative contribution of these factors to detectable fault zone
              properties is poorly known.  The PIs will conduct a combined field and
              laboratory study of seismic velocity and electrical conductivity across an
              unweathered exposure of the active Seal Cove strand of the San Gregorio Fault
              in Moss Beach, California.  Compressional and shear wave velocity and
              anisotropy and electrical conductivity will be measured in the field through
              very high-resolution seismic and resistivity surveys, and in the laboratory on
              representative samples at elevated pressure.  Field measurements will document
              long length-scale effects that cannot be sampled in the laboratory, bridging
              the gap between laboratory and geophysical field data, while the experimental
              data will document pore pressure and stress effects at depth and the
              relationship of physical properties to lithology and structural geology.  The
              results will be used along with existing lithologic and structural data to
              create an integrated model of fault zone physical properties.
