This award, provided by the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics
              Program of the Office of Polar Programs, supports an investigation of the
              recent and contemporary stress field of the Dry Valleys segment of the
              Transantarctic Mountains. This "Antarctic Stress Map Project" (ASMAP) will, as
              an initial phase, obtain data from Neogene-Quaternary volcanic vent alignments
              within the Transantarctic Mountains and adjacent West Antarctic rift system in
              the Ross Sea region. The distribution, alignments, and morphologies of volcanic
              cones and other volcanic features will be mapped using high resolution
              satellite imagery (SPOT, SAR) and aerial photographs. Field tests will assess
              structural associations of faults and volcanic vent alignments. These data will
              be coupled with existing chronological and petrological information on the
              volcanic rocks as well as other dike and fault data in order to interpret
              alignments and to define neotectonic stress states throughout this sector of
              Antarctica. This analysis of the stress regime will be interpreted in
              conjunction with other ongoing studies of contemporary tectonics and
              paleo-kinematics of the Transantarctic Mountains rift flank and adjacent rift
              system. New stress field data from the unique Antarctic setting will help to
              constrain the role of plate-boundary and crustal buoyancy forces in actively
              deforming intraplate regions.
