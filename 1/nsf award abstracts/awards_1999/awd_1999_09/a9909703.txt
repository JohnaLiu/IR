	This pilot project involves the research of a cultural
              anthropologist from Arizona State University conducting summer field research
              on the relationships between migration, culture and the management of marine
              resources in Palawan, the Philippines.  The chief aim is to lay the groundwork
              for the subsequent submission of a larger proposal that explores the conditions
              under which both recent migrants and long-term local residents may be motivated
              to adopt cooperative management practices designed to protect marine resources
              from unsustainable levels of exploitation.  During the summer the three
              researchers (two funded from other sources) will participate in a planning
              workshop, conduct basic ethnographic inquiry on fishing activities, the role of
              international capital in the local fishing industry, and the local definitions
              of the crisis in the fishery. This research should allow the investigators to
              prepare an improved research design that should advance our understanding of
              the causes of environmental degradation in this important region of the world.
