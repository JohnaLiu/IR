Abstract    :
              Dense, non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) represent a significant threat to the
              quality of many groundwater aquifers in the United States.  Being denser than
              water, DNAPLs tend to sink to the base of an aquifer, spreading laterally and
              becoming trapped by low permeability strata.  Using traditional vertical wells
              to remediate DNAPL contaminated sites have proven inefficient owing to the
              limited contact area between the well and the contamination plumes.  Horizontal
              wells are thought to be efficient and cost-effective in such situations owing
              to the large interactive areas with the DNAPL plumes.  However, the present
              knowledge has not provided solutions of water-DNAPL two-liquids flows to a
              horizontal well.  This fact substantially prohibits the wise use of this
              technology for environmental practices.  This project is a combined theoretical
              and experimental study of DNAPL recovery using horizontal wells.  It will
              provide answers to problems such as the water-DNAPL interface change, and
              subcritical, critical and supercritical flows occurring in water-DNAPL
              two-liquid systems.  The relationship between water-DNAPL recovery ratio and
              parameters such as well location, pumping rate, density and viscosity
              differences, and permeabilities will be determined.  This research will provide
              a solid foundation for the improved application of horizontal well technology
              in DNAPL recovery.
