Abstract    :
              This award is jointly supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
              (OMA) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the
              Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE) in the Directorate for Education and
              Human Resources (EHR).  It provides funding for a workshop on improving
              undergraduate education in the mathematical and physical sciences through use
              of technology.  The workshop will be held July 20-22, 1999 in Arlington, VA and
              will involve approximately ninety participants well versed in research and
              undergraduate education in the MPS disciplines and in the use of technology in
              those settings.  Under the direction of Professor Arthur Ellis of the
              University of Wisconsin and a broadly informed external steering committee, the
              workshop will seek to identify current effective practices in the use of
              technology in undergraduate MPS education; research in MPS that benefits the
              development of technology for undergraduate education in the MPS disciplines;
              challenges and opportunities to enhance learning in the MPS disciplines through
              the effective use of technology; strategies to engage the MPS community in the
              more effective use of technology in undergraduate education; and mechanisms to
              ensure access to effective technologies by all genre of institutions.  Also to
              be addressed by the workshop are implications that technology-assisted learning
              has for the integration of research and education; K-12 teacher education and
              continued professional development; increased participation and success of
              groups underrepresented in the MPS disciplines; and increased scientific
              literacy for all citizens.

The report from this workshop is expected to
              provide important guidance to the effective utilization of technology in
              undergraduate education in the MPS disciplines.
