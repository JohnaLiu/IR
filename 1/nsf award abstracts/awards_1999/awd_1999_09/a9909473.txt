The chain of Hawaiian Islands is the surface expression
              of one of the most active mantle plumes ('hot spots') on Earth.  Measurements
              of U-series disequilibria, major and trace element compositions and Nd, and Sr
              isotopic ratios in young basalts from across the Hawaiian Island chain will be
              used to determine melting conditions in the Hawaiian plume. For that purpose,
              we will analyze a suite of rocks that include lavas from volcanoes that extend
              from the leading edge to the trailing end of the Hawaiian chain and cover most
              of the geochemical range exhibited by Hawaiian lavas. The main objective of
              this project will be to use this "zero age" time slice along the island chain,
              the U-series measurements, and numerical models of melting to characterize the
              change in melting dynamics from the core of the plume to its fringes.
