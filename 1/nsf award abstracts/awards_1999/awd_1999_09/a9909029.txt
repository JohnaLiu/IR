Abstract    :
              This proposal is for a workshop focused on the integration of new, developing
              genetic/genomic technology into the study of behavior.  The need for such an
              integration to maintain cohesion in the field of animal behavior is well argued
              by the PI.    The PI has also enlisted the participation of an outstanding
              group of scientists to explore how gene mapping, functional genomics,
              bioinformatics and gene transformation can be applied to a better understanding
              of animal behavior at all levels.  The workshop will provide a forum for
              sharing information, stimulate discussion on the scope of possible advances in
              this field, and discuss the support needs associated with potential growth. 
              The agenda has been altered so that there will be more time for discussion than
              is noted in the proposal to that both goals, the sharing of information as well
              as the definition of the field and facilitation of its growth can be
              accomplished in the time frame of the workshop.  This workshop is both timely
              and important.  It will aid in the process of incorporation of new genetic and
              genomic technologies in to the study of complex behavioral phenomena.
