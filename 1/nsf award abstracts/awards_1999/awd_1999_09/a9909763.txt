Abstract    :
              This project will focus on using a novel scanning probe microscope to study the
              effects of membrane preparation and pretreatment on the surface ionic and
              catalytic activities of proton conducting membranes.  The technique being
              developed by the PI consists of an atomic force microscope in which the circuit
              is modified to include voltage-sensing capability.  This dual-mode
              scanning-probe microscopy technique will be used to probe the topography of
              ionic clusters on the outer surface and within wells of the outer surface of
              membranes exposed to both liquid water and water vapor.  Previous attempts to
              scan membrane surfaces have been made using scanning electrochemical
              microscopy.  This technique relies on measuring a current generated from an
              electrochemical reaction on the surface; consequently, the resolution has been
              low.  In the proposed method, the PI will attempt to measure the potential
              resulting from a platinum nanoprobe contacting an ionic cluster.  Higher
              sensitivity and higher two- and three-dimensional resolution is anticipated. 
              If the topography of the ionic clusters can be measured, the effects of
              membrane pretreatment and manufacturing process on cluster formation could be
              quantified.  Fundamental understanding of the behavior of ionic clusters could
              lead to improvements in fuel-cell membrane assemblies.
