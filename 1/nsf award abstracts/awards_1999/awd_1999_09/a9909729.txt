Abstract    :
              This study seeks to understand and assess the cultural validity of science and
              mathematics assessments used widely in elementary schools.  The aim of the
              study is to understand how students from different cultures react to specific
              forms of test items so that the factors can be made more explicit and then
              considered in the development of standardized tests.  The investigators will
              administer test items selected from the National Assessment of Education
              Progress (NAEP) to diverse populations ranging from Chinese urban to rural
              Yup'ik.  The investigators propose to work individually with each cultural
              group and ask them to "think aloud" as they engage in solving items on the
              assessment.  Students will explain how they interpreted the item and how they
              relate its content to their personal experience.  Another instrument would be
              used to measure soci-cultural activity.
