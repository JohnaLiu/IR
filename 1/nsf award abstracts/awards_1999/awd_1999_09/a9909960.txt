The Ocean Studies Board will conduct a community-wide workshop
              and study to examine the scientific merit of, technical requirements for, and
              overall feasibility of establishing the infrastructure to implement a system of
              Deep Earth Observatories on the Seafloor (DEOS).  The study will also attempt
              to gauge the level of support for such a program within the ocean science
              research community and to what extent DEOS addresses future requirements for
              conducting ocean science research.

DEOS is a community-developed initiative
              to promote observatory science from the seafloor, to understand Earth and ocean
              processes in the temporal domain and complete our spatial imaging of Earth
              structure. The DEOS effort seeks to coordinate the growing interest in seafloor
              observatory science among geoscience initiatives such as RIDGE, MARGINS,
              JOIDES, OSN and CABLE.
