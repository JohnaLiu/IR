This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in earth
              sciences involves John Larsen and a graduate student from Lehigh University and
              Raymond Michels at the University Henri Poincare in Nancy.  The investigators
              propose a study of the conversion of kerogens to petroleum.  Kerogens are
              cross-linked molecular organic solids present in sedimentary rocks and are the
              sources of petroleum and natural gas.  Using complementary approaches, the U.S.
              and French teams will study changes in chemical structure of kerogen and its
              products.  The goal is to better characterize natural processes for petroleum
              formation and to compare these with laboratory processes that attempt to
              duplicate (or come close to duplicating) the natural process.  The U.S. team
              has expertise in physical organic chemical processes.  This is complemented by
              French expertise in geochemistry.  The French group will carry out thermal
              reactions of kerogens in various media and will provide samples of
              kerogen-organic liquid to the U.S. group, who will characterize the changes in
              kerogen macromolecular structure, the thermodynamics, and the molecular weight
              distribution of the extracts.
 
This award represents the U.S. side of a
              joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific
              Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the U.S.
              investigator and one-month training visits for an U.S. graduate student.  The
              CNRS will support the visits of the French researchers to the United States.
