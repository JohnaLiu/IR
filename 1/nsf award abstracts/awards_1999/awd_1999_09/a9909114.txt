Abstract    :
              This project will develop infrastructure to support a structured,
building
              blocks approach to distributed system development, focusing
on group
              communication systems middleware.
An important goal is to bridge the gap
              between theory and systems
research in this area.
Theoretical work will
              include study of the semantics of group
communication systems, development of
              new algorithms to implement
these semantics, and analysis of correctness and
              performance of these
algorithms.
Systems work will include implementation of
              group communication
algorithms, performance experiments, and comparisons of
              observed and
predicted performance.
The project will also study the use of
              these building blocks in
applications, and compare this approach with other
              approaches to
building the same applications.
