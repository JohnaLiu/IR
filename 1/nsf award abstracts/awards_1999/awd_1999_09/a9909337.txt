Abstract    :
              
This project proposes to study small scale scattering in the mantle using
              3-component network and array recordings of PKP precursors and coda. 
              Limitations of previous work using only vertical component global seismic
              network data are that rapid variations in scattering strength exist and in some
              regions, where energetic precursors are recorded without crossing paths, it is
              not possible to distinguish between near-source and near-receiver scattering. 
              This project will analyze the slowness of precursors, as well as their temporal
              variations, using 3-component global and regional network data to reduce the
              source-receiver ambiguity problem.  The study will analyze broad aperture array
              data to produce high resolution regional images of scattering strength.  The
              project will also use PKP coda arrivals, which sample a thicker section of the
              mantle than is sampled by precursors, to examine small-scale scattering more
              than 1000 km above the CMB.
