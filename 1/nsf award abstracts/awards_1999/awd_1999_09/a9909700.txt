There is a lack of field data bearing on the details of how
              caldera collapse relates to eruption progress during large ignimbrite
              eruptions.  We shall study the variation of both pumice and accidental rock
              fragment composition with stratigraphic height and geographic position in the
              chemically zoned Otowi Member of the Bandelier Tuff, erupted at 1.61 Ma during
              formation of the Valles caldera, New Mexico.  Pumice compositional variations
              supply information about which part(s) of the magma body were sampled by an
              ignimbrite emplacement lobe.  Rock fragment lithologies will be tied to
              pre-caldera geology to identify vent locations, and to study how vent
              geometries and positions change with time.   We shall use these data to
              constrain the progress of caldera collapse as the magma body vented during the
              eruption.  In the process, we shall test our new model of caldera formation
              through lateral block sliding following unbuttressing by establishment of dikes
              feeding an initial vent inside the developing caldera.  New vents then open
              around the caldera margin as unbuttressed blocks move to fill the central void,
              allowing rapid eruption from deeper levels in the system.  This model
              potentially has general applicability to all large continental calderas and
              their eruptive products.
