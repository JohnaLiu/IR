Abstract    :
              The Atmospheric Sciences Program at the Univesity of Kansas plans to upgrade its
              student synoptic-mesoscale laboratory to meet the growing needs of the program
              and to better take advantage of current software capabilities and data streams.
               The program has a steady flow of students and will be seeking to add another
              faculty member in the next year.
