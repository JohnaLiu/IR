Abstract    :
              This project will continue investigation into the structure and evolution of the
              Earth's deep interior.  The research will build on previous high-resolution
              global seismic models that have demonstrated the many slabs of subducted
              lithosphere have sunk into the lower mantle.  The research will improve seismic
              wavespeed models by 1) enhancing data coverage with new data (e.g., waveform
              based PP, PKP, PcP, and Pdiff data) and by using realistic 3D sensitivity
              kernels to account for finite frequency effects, 2) make models compatible with
              observed frequency shifts of the Earth's free oscillations, 3) use data to
              constrain variations in bulk sound speed and wavespeed ratios (e.g., Poisson's
              ratio), and 4) after having optimized data coverage, use a flexible
              parameterization to resolve small scale structure in well sampled region.  The
              proposed work would also obtain quantitative estimates of uncertainties.  For
              selected regions, the PI will collaborate with colleagues to study mantle flow
              across the upper and lower mantle transition zones in detail by integrating
              high-resolution imaging, waveform modeling, detailed plate reconstructions, and
              numerical flow calculations.
