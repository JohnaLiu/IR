Conventional theory argues that ecotones gradually shift in
              elevation or latitude over thousands of years. Recent evidence, however,
              suggests that rapid shifts may be occurring in the Southwest due to climate
              changes brought about by drought. At low elevations, pinyon pines growing in
              poor soils on exposed southern slopes have suffered 40-100% mortality as a
              result of the 1996 drought. This SGER research has two major goals. First,
              because many of these trees are now being harvested in salvage operations, it
              is important to document the geographical patterns of mortality before the
              evidence is removed. Second, by studying the patters of mortality within
              individual sites, much can be learned about the factors that determine who
              lives and dies, improving our understanding of the community-level consequences
              of this mortality. This study will record an event that impacts vegetation
              patterns at large spatial scales. This is especially important in the arid
              Southwest where the predicted impacts of global climate changes are thought to
              be great. Furthermore, because pinyon pine is a dominant tree of the third
              largest vegetation type in North America, anything that affects this tree is
              likely to have ripple effects on the rest of the dependent community. Analyses
              will provide evidence of the dynamic nature of boundary populations, document
              short-term responses of long-lived species, and quantify rapid stand
              replacement of one dominant by another. Demonstrating such events has important
              implications for understanding of community and ecosystem responses to record
              droughts and climate change. The results of this project will be incorporated
              into an on-going LTREB research program in this area.
