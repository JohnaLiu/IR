	This project advances a unique geochronometric approach
              for unravelling the details of polymetamorphism in complex Precambrian terrains
              along the northwestern and southeastern margins of the Archean Wyoming
              Province.   The research will be focused on crystalline rocks magnificently
              exposed in the Black Hills (South Dakota) and the Dillon Block (southwestern
              Montana), where overprinted deformational fabrics and mineral assemblages of
              uncertain Precambrian age are widespread.  A comprehensive three-year program
              of field work, petrology, thermobarometry, and geochronology will be undertaken
              in these terrains to establish: (1) the timing, duration, rate, intensity,
              frequency, and heat source(s) of metamorphism; and, (2) the interplay of
              deformation and fluids in space and time.  Timing of fabrics and assemblages
              will be determined using new single-mineral geochronometers developed and
              validated during the late 1990's.  One new method involves Pb stepwise leaching
              (PbSL) of rock-forming metamorphic minerals, followed by 207Pb-206Pb isotopic
              analysis.  PbSL offers reliable growth ages for low-U minerals like garnet,
              even where high-U inclusions like zircon and/or monazite are present.  The
              other new method involves electron microprobe (EMP) analysis of monazite (a
              Pb-retentive accessory) - for Th, U, Pb, and other major elements. EMP analysis
              offers a viable chemical means for reconnaissance dating of monazite growth
              generations - in situ and with high spatial resolution.  Regionally, the
              results obtained in this project will provide new insights into the nature and
              timing of Precambrian continental collision(s) involving the Wyoming Province
              margins during the assembly of supercontinent Laurentia.  Globally, these
              results will demonstrate a new approach for investigating Precambrian
              (plate-)tectonic processes in general.
