Abstract    :
              This award is for support for two years of funding to develop a 480,000 year
              climate record for West Antarctica using samples obtained from a 600 meter
              "horizontal ice core" from the Mt. Moulton blue ice field. Continuous analyses
              of the deuterium/hydrogen (D/H) ratio of ice (dDice) and detailed analyses of
              the elemental/isotopic composition of trapped gases along the Mt. Moulton
              horizontal ice core will be made to confirm the continuous nature of the
              record, by comparison with the continuous Vostok ice core record, which spans
              the last 423 kyr. Once the continuous nature of the record has been confirmed,
              these results will be correlated with similar records from other Antarctic and
              Greenland ice cores. In addition, the radiometerically dated tephra layers from
              Mt. Moulton can then be transferred to other ice cores (namely Vostok) via the
              gas records (methane (CH4) and oxygen isotope (d18O) of paleoatmospheric O2) to
              improve the current ice core age models for these cores.  Results from this
              study will be very useful in deciphering the recently published Taylor Dome
              dDice record in the context of the continent-wide climate history of
              Antarctica. The Moulton climate records will also be correlated with similar
              records from the Siple Dome and inland WAIS deep ice core sites when they
              become available.
