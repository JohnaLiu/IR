Abstract    :
              These studies will utilize functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
              to
examine the changes in brain activity that accompany adaptation to
              stress.
There is little known about the changes in brain activity associated
              with
adaptation to acute stress even though the neurochemical and
              hormonal
adaptations to stress are well known.   Two closely related species,
              the
cotton-top tamarin and the common marmoset which have many biological
              and
behavioral similarities but have very distinct temperaments will be
              studied.
The marmoset is calmer and less anxious while the tamarin is
              extremely
excitable and prone to stress-related diseases like colitis and
              colon
cancer.  Male marmosets and tamarins will be fitted into a custom
              designed
head and body restrainer and imaged while fully conscious inside the
              MRI
device for one hour each day over several consecutive days.  Their
              brain
activity as measured by small magnetic shifts associated with changes
              in
blood flow to areas of increased neuronal activity will be compared
              and
correlated with saliva concentration of a stress hormones as they adapt
              to
the stress of repeated immobilization.

These studies will provide a
              global perspective on the neural networks in
the brain which are involved in
              the adaptation to repeated acute stress in
non-human primates with different
              temperaments.  With the advent of
noninvasive fMRI  in awake animals, it is
              now possible to follow the same
animal over several stressful events and map
              the global changes in brain
activity accompanying adaptation.
