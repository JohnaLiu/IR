At the 1999 MRS Fall Meeting in Boston, MA (November 29 -
              December 3) a symposium will be held on "Electrical, Optical, and Magnetic
              Properties of Organic Solid-State Materials V"  (Symposium BB).  The goal of
              the symposium is to facilitate interdisciplinary interactions and information
              exchange within a broad spectrum of researchers with interests on electronic,
              optical and magnetic propeties of organic structures for photonics and
              electronics will be highlighted.  The NSF funds will be used to support the
              attendance of young Americans scientists.  

There are emerging opportunities
              related to the design, synthesis, physical properties, processing, and device
              applications of organic materials.  Great potential for technological advances
              exist primarily in the area of communications that are based on solid state
              materials.  This is a strategic area of emphasis at NSF.
