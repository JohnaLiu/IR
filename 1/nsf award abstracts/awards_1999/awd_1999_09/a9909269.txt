Supercontinent assembly and dispersal
              throughout geologic time represent a fundamental theme in earth history.  The
              Phanerozoic assembly and dispersal of Gondwana and Pangea has been extensively
              studied but was preceded by an earlier supercontinent, Rodinia, which began to
              assemble at 1300 Ma, possibly incorporating most or all continental crust by
              1000 Ma and began to disperse at 750 Ma.  This project focuses on a key element
              in both the Rodinian and Gondwanan supercontinents which involves a
              large-scale, poorly understood 1.1. Ga within plate igneous province in the
              Kalahari craton.  One interpretation is that the igneous province, and possible
              correlatives in Antarctica and Laurentia, originated from a large-scale mantle
              thermal anomaly or plume near one of the main sites of plate convergence during
              Rodinia assembly.  This project will gather geochronological, paleomagnetic and
              geochemical data required to test the hypothesis that the Umkondo and
              Laurentian provinces are expressions of a single large-scale magmatic event. 
              Results will help paleogeographic reconstructions of the neoproterzoic and has
              implications for formation of large igneous provinces in relation to
              supercontinent evolution in general.
