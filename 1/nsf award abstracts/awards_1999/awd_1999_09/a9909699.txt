It is now widely recognized that convergent
              margins can experience accretion or subduction erosion with rates that depend
              on a variety of factors.  The processes by which accretionary wedges grow are
              well documented, however the processes by which accretionary wedges erode are
              more enigmatic.  This project will examine the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica and
              evaluate the current rates and the total shortening associated with active
              thrust faults in the inner fore arc of the Middle America Trench-faults that
              allow subduction erosion through underthrusting of the outer fore arc.  Results
              will be used to evaluate whether there has been an arcward shift in the
              location of rapid shortening from the toe to the interior of the wedge for this
              area of rough crust and shallow subduction.  This work is expected to increase
              knowledge about how accretaionary wedges erode.
