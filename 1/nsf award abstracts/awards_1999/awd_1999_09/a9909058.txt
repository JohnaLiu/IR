Abstract    :
              North Carolina A&T State University

This project, TALENT-21: Gateway for
              Advancing Science and Mathematics Talent, is a framework to increase the number
              of students in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology, enhance the
              career competitiveness of SMET graduates, and encourage more graduates to
              pursue the Ph.D. in science or engineering. These goals are accomplished by (1)
              curricular reform in calculus, chemistry, and physics; (2) broadening
              interdisciplinary programs; (3) faculty development in successful models of
              student learning and in effective use of technology in teaching; (4) structured
              undergraduate research training; (5) undergraduate research experiences with
              universities, industry, national laboratories; (6) scholarships; (7) summer
              institutes to help students transition from high school to college and to build
              academic foundations for success in first and second-year courses; and (8)
              competitive recruitment. Outstanding qualities of TALENT-21 include a unified
              approach among faculty in physics, chemistry, and mathematics to improve
              learning in the SMET "gate keeper" courses, and early involvement of students
              in research through structured training experiences.
