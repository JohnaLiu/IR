The aim of the project is to obtain a time-series data set
              that will be used to understand the processes that control the physical and
              chemical character of ocean-island volcanoes and their evolution through time.
              The project will concentrate on intermediate hundred thousand to million year
              time scales, which is on the order of the lifetime of volcanoes erupted in the
              intra-plate oceanic setting. The proposed work will focus on five carefully
              chosen volcanic sections from La Palma and El Hierro, the two westernmost
              islands on the Canary Island archipelago. The sections have been recovered from
              drill-core in exceptionally thick sections that traverse the entire history of
              the volcanoes (100-300,000 years before present). Some of the samples have been
              characterized through field mapping, paleomagnetic studies and K-Ar dating by
              Dr. Juan Carlos Carracedo, director of the Estacion Volcanogica de Canarias.
              The geochemical data to be obtained in this study will be used to address
              several issues fundamental to understanding ocean island volcanism. The Canary
              Islands data set will be compared with similar data from Hawaii. Because these
              two volcanic chains have distinct contrasts in age, compositions, fluxes and
              physical evolution, this comparison will provide additional insights into the
              range of processes that control planetary volcanism.
