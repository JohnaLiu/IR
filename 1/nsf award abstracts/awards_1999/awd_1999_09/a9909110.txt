This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration involves
              Joel Koplik and a graduate student of the City College, City University of New
              York and Jean-Pierre Hulin of the University Marie and Pierre Curie in Paris,
              France.  The investigators propose to study several interrelated problems
              involving transport phenomena in geological fracture systems.  They will
              emphasize the consequences of pore space geometry associated with fractured
              rock surfaces and networks of fractions on fluid flow and on the motion of
              suspended particles.  The key geometrical feature of this work is the
              self-affine nature of fracture surfaces and the resulting correlations in the
              velocity field when fluid flows through such a fracture.  The U.S. investigator
              brings to this collaboration theoretical and numerical expertise.  This will be
              complemented by the experimental studies on reconstructed fractures conducted
              by the French group.  The project will advance understanding of the motions of
              fluids and particles in geological formations, with application to water
              supply, hydrocarbon production, and waste disposal.  The work is motivated by
              environmental concerns about groundwater contamination and safe disposal of
              nuclear waste in fractured rocks. 

This award represents the U.S. side of a
              joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific
              Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the U.S.
              investigator and graduate student.  The CNRS will support the visits of the
              French researchers to the United States.
