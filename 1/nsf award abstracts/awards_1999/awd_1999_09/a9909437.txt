The Southern Alps of New Zealand are a
              relatively simple and geologically young example of transpressive continental
              collision, and has been the site of considerable recent research.  However,
              important questions remain concerning the initial development and early
              evolution of the orogen.  This project will attempt to determine the timing of
              the transition between pure transcurrent relative movement to the present
              obliquely convergent geometry of the suture fault, whether this event was
              diachronous along the Australian-Pacific plate fault and whether shear heating
              along the Alpine fault contributed to the thermal structure of the orogen. 
              This work includes determining the time-temperature history of granitic rocks
              from the western footwall of the Alpine fault and thermal modeling.  Results
              are expected to clarify early events in the development of the modern orogen.
