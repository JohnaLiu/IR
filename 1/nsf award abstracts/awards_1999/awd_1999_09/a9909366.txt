Abstract    :
              "The Seventh Conference on Small Genomes" is being held in Arlington, VA.,
              November 13-17, 1999. The goals of the conference are to provide a forum for
              investigators from different fields to interact with each other and to update
              the recent advances in microbial genomics. This meeting is focussing on
              defining gene functions and regulatory networks using integrative
              multidisciplinary approaches and exploring genome sequence information to
              understand various biological processes. Sessions include: (1) microbial
              diversity, microbial genome sequencing, and microbial genome programs; (2)
              bioinformatics and functional genomics; (3) genomic technology and functional
              genomics; (4) genetic and biochemical technology for defining gene functions;
              (5) cellular processes, regulatory networks and evolution; (6) systematic
              functional analysis of genome sequences; and (7) applied functional genomics. 
              This award is providing travel support to graduate students, postdoctoral
              fellows, and young faculty attending the conference.
