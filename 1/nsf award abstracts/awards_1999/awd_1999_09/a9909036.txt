Abstract    :
              On August 27, 1998, 10:22 UT, the most powerful cosmic burst ever to hit the
              solar system was recorded by the X-ray and gamma-ray detectors on the
              interplanetary network of spacecraft.  The gamma-ray burst had a significant
              effect on the Earth's middle and upper atmosphere.  Ionization in the upper
              atmosphere increased to near daytime levels.  The effects were observed in the
              Very Low Frequency (VLF) radio region by Stanford University's Holographic
              Array for Ionospheric Lightning research (HAIL).  Changes in the propagation
              characteristics of the VLF signals indicated an abrupt change in plasma
              densities in the lower ionosphere.  This one-year SGER effort will examine the
              global effects of the gamma-ray burst on ionization, conductivities, and minor
              species chemistry in the middle and upper atmosphere.  The primary tools to be
              used in this study are a coupled photon-electron transport model, and a
              comprehensive time-dependent model of ionospheric chemistry.
