Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses three needs of the Aeronomy community and the TIMED
              program. i) Determine the removal rates for the OH (u = 7, 8, and 9) levels by
              O2 at mesospheric temperatures to the required accuracy of15%.  ii)Measure the
              removal rate of various levels of vibrationally excited OH by O atoms to the
              required accuracy of 50%.  iii) Study the pathways of energy disposition from
              the collisional removal of vibrational energy from the OH(u = 7, 8, and 9)
              levels.  Currently, the collisional removal rates of the OH (u= 7, 8, and 9)
              levels by O2 are only known, through the PI's previous measurements at room
              temperature, to an accuracy of 29%, 13% and 65%, respectively.  These
              measurements also showed that the rate for OH (u = 10) removal by 02 increased
              by 37% as the temperature was reduced from 310 K to 223 K.  There are no
              measurements or calculations of the collisional removal rates for vibrational
              levels of OH by O atoms.  Finally, the mechanisms for vibrational energy
              removal have only been deduced form modeling studies, with uncertain results. 
              Thus, the proposed laboratory measurements are needed if the SABER experiment
              of the TIMED program is to meet its accuracy goals and to understand the
              intensity of OH emission in the atmosphere
