Abstract    :
              This project will research and develop innovative techniques for indexing
              handwritten historical manuscripts.  Automatic indexing of historical archives
              to create indexes similar to those at the back of most printed books would
              potentially make available a whole new set of materials to scholars and
              students.  Conversion of printed materials usually involves Optical Character
              Recognition (OCR) to convert them to machine-readable form.  OCR does not work
              well on handwritten text.  The investigators propose to use a scheme known as
              Word Spotting in which a document page is segmented into words and lists of
              words are created.  By matching word images against each other multiple
              instances of the same word are then identified.  A user then provides the ASCII
              equivalent to a representative word image from the lists and links to the
              original documents are automatically generated.  For this approach to succeed,
              a number of problems need to be solved including new techniques for "cleaning
              up" a document by removing non-meaningful visual artifacts, extending existing
              algorithms for word segmentation of handwritten documents, and building new
              algorithms to find similarity between handwritten word images.
