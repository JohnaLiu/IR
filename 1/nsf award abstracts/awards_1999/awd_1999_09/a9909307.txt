BROWN

The National Science Foundation, Office of Polar
              Programs (NSF/OPP) has sponsored a Request For Proposal issued under the
              identification CPO-98-016, "National Science Foundation Satellite Ground and
              Space Operations for Telecommunications to Remote Locations."  The purpose of
              this solicitation is to provide expanded satellite telecommunications services
              in support of the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) that have been previously
              supplied under NSF assistance grants.  The increased importance of satellite
              communications to both the science research program and operational USAP
              support mission at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station and an increase in scope
              of support services anticipated require NSF to change the method of service
              acquisition from an assistance grant to a full contract.  A significant
              escalation in scope requires the telemetry, command, and flight operations of
              the GOES-3 satellite, once acquired by NSF/OPP under agreement with the
              Department of Commerce, NOAA, for the transfer of the GOES-3 satellite to NSF
              control.

NSF/OPP and the NSF Contracts and Policy Oversight Division
              (NSF/CPO) have received a justification for other than open and full
              competition (JOFOC) from the NSF Competition Advocate that permits the issuance
              of a sole source contract to the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of
              Marine and Atmospheric Science (UM/RSMAS), the established provider of
              satellite communications services to South Pole Station via multiple prior
              assistance grants.  UM/RSMAS has extensive expertise with the Government
              provided ATS-3, LES-9, and GOES-3 satellites, to include related telecommand
              and flight operations experience with ATS-3 under a separate NASA contract. 
              Following a mandatory Commerce Business Daily announcement of intent, no
              alternative sources were identified.

A five year contract period, consisting
              of one base year with four one-year renewal options, has been negotiated with
              UM/RSMAS.  The contract will be managed as a cost-reimbursement contract that
              will utilize annual program plans to define the actual level of effort and cost
              for each option year.  The pricing proposal accepted by NSF consists of
              contract Year 1 at a cost of $663,289.  Out-year estimates for Years 2-3 are
              $816,891, $716,352, $746,024, and $760,713 (sequentially) for an estimated five
              year total of $3,703,269. 

It is recommended that a letter contract be
              issued initially in order to assure continuity of service from the expiring
              grant.  Restrictions limit initial letter contract awards to 50% of the first
              year cost.  Two FY 1999 funding awards are anticipated to cover Year 1 costs
              for the periods of June-October and November-December (1999).  The second
              increment is recommended to allow continuity of service while administrative
              processing one additional contract Year 1 FY 2000 funding increment at the
              start of the new Fiscal Year.  Incremental funding is therefore recommended,
              and an initial award of $323,134 is recommended for FY 1999 funding to cover
              the period June-October of the base year cost of $663,289.
