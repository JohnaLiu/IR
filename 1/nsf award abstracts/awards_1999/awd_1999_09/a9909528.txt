The Middle Triassic Latemar Limestone (Italy), a thick
              succession of hundreds of meter-scale shallow marine depositional cycles, is
              unique in that to date it is the only cyclic sedimentary deposit that has been
              intensively analyzed for Milankovitch forcing (Hinnov & Golldhammer, 1991) as
              well as radiometrically dated (indirectly) using the zircon single crystal
              technique on volcanoclastic interbeds in the coeval basinal deposits (mundil et
              al. 1996).  Unfortunately, the published results of the two methods as applied
              to the Latemar Limestone are in serious conflict (Brack et al. 1996; Hardie &
              Hinnov 1997).  In essence, the zircon dates have been interpreted to indicate
              that the Latemar cyclic succession was deposited in 2-4 m.y. whereas the
              cyclostratigraphic analysis indicates a Milankovitch origin which implies
              deposition over a ca. 10-12 m.y. period.  These conflicting results present a
              serious dilemma that goes well beyond the Latemar problem in view of the fact
              that both zircon single crystal and cyclostratigraphic methods have come to be
              widely applied in chronostratigraphic studies.  In an effort to resolve the
              problem, PIs propose to (1) re-examine the Latemar cyclostratigraphy for
              Milankovitch forcing using the latest time series modelling and analysis
              techniques, and (2) determine U/Pb ages of zircon crystals from volcanoclastic
              interbeds, the source ignimbrites, and the Predazzo granite that cuts trhough
              the Latemar massif.  The important new approach PIs will bring to the zircon
              dating will be pre-screening of the zircons using CL and BSE imaging techniques
              (Hanchar & Miller, 1995) and the dating of microslices of selected parts of
              single zircon crystals.  It is their hope that this proposed new study of the
              "Latemar controversy" will function as an important test case for high
              resolution dating of cyuclic sedimentary successions.
