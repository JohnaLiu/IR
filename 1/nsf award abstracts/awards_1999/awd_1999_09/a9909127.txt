Abstract    :
              The Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) Symposium provides an annual forum for
              research exchange in the area of rapid prototyping.  The meeting draws
              approximately 200 researchers from universities, companies and national
              laboratories from all over the world.  Approximately 95 talks and posters were
              presented at the 1998 meeting. The meeting is well regarded by the research
              community. The SFF Symposium also attracts graduate students worldwide. The
              previous NSF support contributed to the reduction of student registration fee
              in the past.  The 1999 SFF Symposium will be held at the University of Texas at
              Austin, August 9-11.

This SFF symposium is perhaps the best research meeting
              on rapid prototyping in the world. It is of significant importance to the
              researchers and provides an excellent learning experience for the participated
              graduate students.
