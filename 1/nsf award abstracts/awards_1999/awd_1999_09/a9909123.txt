Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a workshop to be held in the Washington area
              on May 26, 1999 to  explore the possibilities for a major program in digital
              library research by a consortium of institutions in the EPSCOR states. The
              workshop will be attended by university researchers from the EPSCOR states,
              representatives of the major national organizations in the digital library
              area, a few representatives of universities playing lead roles in the digital
              library arena, and representatives of the EPSCOR organizational community. The
              need for this workshop is critical to determine the need for digital library
              programs in the EPSCOR states and the technological needs for extending digital
              library research into new areas.
