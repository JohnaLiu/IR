This study seeks to understand the geology of a large region
              in the remote Sierra Madre mountains of western Mexico.  Although south of the
              border, previous investigations have shown that volcanic rocks of the sierra
              are a manifestation of the same plate tectonic forces as those that triggered
              volcanism across the western United States.  The volcanic record in the sierra,
              however, is much more voluminous and complete than in equivalent volcanic
              fields to the north.  Although only about 5% of the Sierra Madre Occidental
              volcanic field has been mapped, a recently completed road to Mexico's famous
              Copper Canyon has opened the heart of the world's largest rhyolitic volcanic
              province to geologic exploration.  The principal investigator and several
              undergraduate student researchers will map the volcanic centers and volcanic
              units of the 3,500 km2, Copper Canyon area.  The result will be the largest
              mapped region in the central Sierra Madre Occidental.   As with other
              "discovery phase" mapping projects, this research is expected to lay the
              groundwork for dozens of subsequent investigations of broader scientific and
              economic impact.  In the process, a group of undergraduates, minority students
              underrepresented in the earth science field among them, will learn the
              practical skills they need to propel them toward a graduate education and
              productive careers in the United States - Mexico Border Region.
