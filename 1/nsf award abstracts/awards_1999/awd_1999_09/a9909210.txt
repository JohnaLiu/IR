After extensive episodes of compressional faulting
              during orogenesis it is not uncommon for a region to undergo a period of
              relaxation and regional extension, accompanied by differential uplift and
              erosion.  However, the timing of these events relative to compressional phases
              and the relationship of uplift to preexisting faults is unclear.  This project
              will examine the uplift, erosion and post-orogenic reactivation faulting in a
              portion of the New England Appalachians where preliminary data has indicated
              Cretaceous uplift and erosion with a suggestion that differential uplift is
              spatially associated with older, compressional faults.  Results are expected to
              clarify the pattern of post-orogenic uplift and erosion and may provide insight
              into the general processers of regional tectonic transition from compressional
              to extensional environments.
