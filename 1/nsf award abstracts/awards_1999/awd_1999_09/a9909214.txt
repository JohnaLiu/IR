Abstract    :
              9909214
There is a tremendous growth in technologies associated with
              microdevices using
active polymers for microfluidics and microrobotics
              applications. This SGER
project uses a coupled experimental and analytical
              approach to provide the
constitutive descriptions necessary for systematic
              design using compliant active
materials. A novel Biaxial System for Active
              Materials (BSAM) is being developed
to measure the finite deformations of thin
              films of such materials, including
hyperelastic and viscoelastic behavior and
              active response under mechanical
load, by measuring local deformation and
              applied force histories while
controlling the trajectory in stretch space.
              Criscione invariants will be used
to characterize the hyperelastic
              potentials.
