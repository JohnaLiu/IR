This Americas Program award will fund travel and related
              expenses for support of a group of ten US senior and post-doctoral level
              scientists and five Central Americans to participate in the Latin American
              Symposium on Solid State Physics to take place in Cartagena de Indias,
              Colombia.  Organizers are Dr. Sergio E. Ulloa, Ohio University, in
              collaboration with Prof. Jairo Giraldo, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.
              

The emphasis of the meeting will be on novel materials and low-dimensional
              systems, although without excluding more traditional topics in solid state
              physics.  A high level of expertise exists in Latin America in this area, both
              in experimental and theoretical aspects, so there will be reciprocal benefits
              for participants of both countries.  Apart from diverse direct scientific
              interactions, participation by American scientists, both at the junior and
              senior level will facilitate exchanges with scientists in Latin America which
              could lead to future scientific collaborations.
