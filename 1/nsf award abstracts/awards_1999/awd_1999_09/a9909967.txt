This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative
              research in marine microbial biology involves Arthur Grossman and a
              postdoctoral researcher at the Carnegie Institute of Washington, located at
              Stanford University, and Daniel Vaulot of the Roscoff Biological Station of the
              French National Center for Scientific Research.  They will collaborate on
              studies of physiological processes in freshwater and marine cyanobacteria and
              the control mechanism, which allows acclimation to environmental change.  Using
              a technique known as differential display, the investigators propose to
              identify environmentally triggered changes in gene expression in freshwater
              Synechoccus and Prochlorococcus.  

The U.S. investigators bring to this
              collaboration expertise in photosynthetic bacteria.  This is complemented by
              the French investigator's expertise in biological oceanography.  Their
              collaboration will advance understanding of the processes in cyanobacteria when
              environmental conditions are altered and how these acclimation processes are
              tailored to the diverse habitats in which cyanobacteria can thrive.  This award
              will support the incremental costs of this international collaboration; that
              is, the travel to Roscoff, France and subsistence expenses of the U.S.
              investigator and postdoctoral researcher.
