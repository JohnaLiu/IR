Some Cu and Au-bearing ores, such as many porphyry, skarn and
              sheeted vein-type deposits, are related spatially and temporally to
              intermediate to felsic intrusive igneous rocks.  However, the controls on the
              Cu to Au ratio in these deposits are not clear.  We propose to study one aspect
              of the magmatic behavior of Cu and Au that can shed light on how Cu/Au of ore
              can be affected by magmatic parameters.  In the proposed research, we will
              investigate the partitioning of Cu and Au among the phases magnetite, biotite
              and melt.  Experiments on magnetite and biotite will be conducted over a range
              of temperatures and pressures.  The oxygen fugacity will also be varied in the
              experiments.  We will combine the results of the proposed research with our
              published results on the partitioning of Cu and Au between sulfide minerals and
              melt to evaluate the effect of the sequestering of ore metals on the Au/Cu
              ratios of intrusion-related ore fluids.
