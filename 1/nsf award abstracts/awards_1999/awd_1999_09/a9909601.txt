Anomalous biotic and
              physical trends in mid-Cretaceous strata of the northern U.S. Western Interior
              basin have prompted some authors to propose a brief connection between the
              northern/Boreal and southern/Tethyan arm of the Western Interior sea at the
              time of the Early/Late Cretaceous boundary, even though no direct physical
              evidence for such a connection is yet cited.  The proposed research will test
              this hypothesis by applying sequence stratigraphic, paleontologic, palynologic,
              and chemostratigraphic techniques to mid-Cretaceous strata in the central
              Western Interior where a connection may be recorded.  The study aims to clarify
              several stratigraphic issues in economically important mid-Cretaceous strata of
              the United States and Canada.  Its broader implications are to reevaluate
              Cretaceous faunal mixing and evolutionary trends, and to constrain the
              enigmatic Lower/Upper Cretaceous boundary in North America.  The resultant
              integrated stratigraphic framework is also the first step in testing the
              currently published hypothesis that the proposed brief marine connection is
              responsible for the regional anoxic event, and associated changes in the global
              carbon cycle, recorded in mid-Cretaceous strata of Canada.  This is
              particularly important to modem climate modeling, because many modem
              transgressing oceans are separated by only a low and narrow isthmus.
