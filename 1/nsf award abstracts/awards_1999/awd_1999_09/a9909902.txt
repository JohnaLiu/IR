Model surfaces with molecularly
              controlled random roughness will be investigated, all based on the
              self-assembly of rigid thiols on gold surfaces with large atomically flat
              areas.  The wetting properties of these molecularly rough surfaces will be
              studied using simple polymeric liquids; the adsorption of liquid crystalline
              molecules and of polymers to these surfaces will also be investigated.

The
              research is aimed at answering the following questions:  (1) Can model surfaces
              be prepared wit molecularly designed roughness using self-assembly of rigid
              thiols of different molecular lengths?  (2) Does critical molecular roughness
              exists, beyond which the wetting by simple and polymeric liquids is affected? 
              (3) How does the wetting of rough surfaces by a polymeric liquid depend on
              molecular weight?  (4) What is the relation between surface tension and surface
              roughness and how do they affect wetting?  (5) How does adsorption depend on
              molecular roughness?  (6) Can enthalpy be used as the driving force for
              engineering polymer surfaces using interactions with molecularly roughness
              surfaces?

A foundation will be established to start answering these
              questions in this one-year exploratory research program.
