The Maryland Science Center requests $1,586,279 to develop
              "Titanic Science."  The Maryland Science Center will develop an 8,000-square
              foot interactive traveling exhibition focusing on recent scientific and
              forensic investigations surrounding the Titanic tragedy of 1912.  A planning
              grant from NSF enabled key personnel to participate in the five-week 1998
              scientific expedition to the Titanic wreck site and interact with professional
              scientists.  This expedition will target the general public and provide
              educational services for students in grades 6-9.  The exhibition will travel to
              15 host sites and be seen by over 2.5 million visitors.  To help parents and
              educators make the most of this exhibition, a Titanic Explorers Kit and
              teachers guides will be developed.
