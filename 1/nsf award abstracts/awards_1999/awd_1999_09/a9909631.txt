This project involves the collaborative research of
              anthropologists from the University of Colorado in 9904044 and a demographer
              from the University of North Carolina.  The research will build on over ten
              years of prior research to examine causal factors resulting in a shift from
              pastoral to agricultural land use by Maasai people of Tanzania.  Using social
              surveys and intensive interviews conducted by US and Tanzanian researchers, the
              project will examine family demography, history, and changes in subsistence
              strategies to explain the constraints and choices impelling a gradual shift
              from pastoral to agricultural household economy.  The trend towards sedentism
              by East Africa pastoralists has been significant, and has affected the wildlife
              preserves in the region.  This research will explain the decision to move from
              one means of livelihood to another by household level decisions, and will
              provide information valuable to local planners as well as relevant to other
              comparable situations in the world.
