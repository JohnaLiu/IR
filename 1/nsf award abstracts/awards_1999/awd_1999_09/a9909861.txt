Abstract    :
              This project is a collaboration between the University of New Hampshire and the
              University of Alaska.  It was submitted to the Environmental Geochemistry and
              Biogeochemistry Program (EGB) and is supported by the Atmospheric Chemistry
              Program of the Division of Atmospheric Sciences; the Petrology and Geochemistry
              Program, and the Hydrologic Sciences Program of the Division of Earth Sciences;
              and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division of Chemistry of
              the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.  	

Methyl bromide
              and methyl chloride are anthropogenically influenced trace gases that play an
              important role in the stratospheric ozone balance.  Although their
              biogeochemisty is not well understood, it is known that these gases have
              significant natural sources.  The atmospheric budgets of these gases are out of
              balance because the identified sinks for both gases outweigh known sources. 
              Recently, it has been discovered that flooded peatlands are a terrestrial
              source for these gases which could impact their global budget.  Information is
              still lacking about the regional distribution and magnitude of this new source
              and how the flooded soils might affect their ambient mixing ratios.  In this
              project direct flux measurements of methyl bromide and methyl chloride will be
              made in a variety of peatlands and experiments will be carried out to determine
              the chemical, physical, and biological parameters controlling these fluxes.
