This award is for support for three years of funding to develop
              a history of snow accumulation and physical processes occurring in the upper
              layers of ice deposited at several sites in Antarctica, using cosmogenic
              in-situ  Carbon-14 (14C) and cosmogenic Beryllium-10 (10Be) as radiotracers. 
              The proposed research emerges from recent studies of cosmogenic in-situ 14C in
              GISP2 Holocene and several  Antarctic ice samples, which revealed marked
              differences in the 14C concentrations in the samples, compared to the
              theoretically expected values.  The GISP2 samples have about the expected
              amount of 14C but the Antarctic samples are deficient by 30-50% or more.  These
              results suggest that in slowly accumulating ice samples (such as occur in
              Antarctica), the cosmic ray implanted 14C is somehow partially lost, but
              quantitatively preserved in samples from areas of high accumulation.  These
              results suggest that after deposition of the cosmogenic 14C, its concentration
              is decreased in firn due to processes such as recrystallization,
              sublimation/evaporation and redeposition.  In order to quantify these
              processes, the atmospheric cosmogenic 10Be in ice samples will also be
              measured.  Since 10Be and 14C have different responses to the firnification
              processes, their simultaneous study can help to elucidate the nature and 
              importance of these processes.  Samples from Taylor Dome, Vostok and Siple Dome
              will all be studied.
