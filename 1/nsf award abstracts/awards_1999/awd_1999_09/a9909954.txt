This award supports the participation of American
              scientists in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Coherent Quantum Systems, to be held in
              Newport, Rhode Island from September 18-22, 2000.  The co-organizers are
              Professors Mark Kasevich at Yale University in New Haven and Professor Masao
              Kitano at Kyoto University in Japan.  The past three years have seen the
              development of unprecedented methods to manipulate and investigate the
              coherence properties of simple quantum systems involving atoms and photons. 
              Examples include:  1) the experimental observation interference between two
              initially isolated condenses;  2) the demonstration of atom holographic
              techniques;  3) the study of the phase evolution of two species condenses;  4)
              the experimental beginnings of non-linear atom optics;  5) the creation of
              entangled states with ions;  6) theoretical advances in quantum computing;  7)
              the observation of slow group velocities in a Bose-Einstein condensates; and 
              8) the demonstration of quantum teleportation.  With this explosion in growth
              of methods in a diverse group of physical systems, this meeting provides the
              opportunity for catalyzing advances by bringing together U.S. and Japanese
              researchers.  The discussion topics for the seminar include:  (1)
              electromagnetically-induced transparency/coherent interactions;  (2) atom
              optics and interferometry;  (3) precision measurements;  (4) cold atoms and
              molecules;  (5) Bose-Einstein condensation;  and (6) quantum computation and
              quantum measurement.  

Recent progress in the fields of quantum optics and
              atomic physics continues to strengthen our ability to observe and manipulate
              coherent quantum systems.  In addition to amplifying our understanding of
              fundamental issues of quantum coherence, these advances are opening exciting
              applications in the areas of atom optics and interferometry, precision
              measurements, non-linear optics, quantum measurement, and quantum computing. 
              The Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve younger
              researchers as both participants and observers.  The exchange of ideas and data
              with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance
              their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects. 
              Dissemination of information from the meeting will be available at the
