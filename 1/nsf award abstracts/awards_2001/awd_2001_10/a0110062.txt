Abstract    :
              Professor Sandra Greer of the University of Maryland is funded by the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform experimental
              measurements of the phase behaviors of polymers in solution.  Many of the
              proposed measurements will generate data that can be used to definitively test
              recent theoretical proposals of liquid-liquid phase separation in polymer
              systems.  Methods include magnetic densimetry, rheometry, tensiometry and small
              angle neutron scattering.  

The polyethylene oxide polymer systems to be
              investigated have important applications in a broad range of industries, and
              the characterization of PEO/solvent phases should be of direct interest in many
              of these areas.
