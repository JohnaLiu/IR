Abstract    :
              Professor Michael De Rosa in the Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State
              University, Delaware County Campus is supported by the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies on new syntheses of
              2-aminopyrroles and the development of new routes to various polycyclic
              compounds by cycloaddition reactions of 2-aminopyrroles.  Diels-Alder and
              inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder reactions with 2-aminopyrroles will be
              investigated to form novel heterocycles.

With the support of the Organic and
              Macromolecular Program, Professor De Rosa is developing new methods for
              preparing various organic compounds which may have useful pharmaceutical
              applications.  The research will be carried out with the assistance of
              undergraduate students who will receive extensive training in organic synthesis
              methodology.
