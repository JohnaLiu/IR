Genetic analysis of asymmetric cell division in C. elegans
              early embryos has identified a set of conserved PAR proteins important for the
              establishment and/or maintenance of zygotic and cellular polarity.  The PAR
              proteins are localized asymmetrically in early blastomeres and their
              mislocalization correlates with changes in the patterns of cell cleavage and
              the distribution of cell fate determinants.  Drosophila and vertebrate PAR
              homologs are also asymmetrically localized and important for cell polarity in
              these animals.  Therefore, investigating how the C. elegans PAR proteins become
              asymmetrically localized and how their activity controls cellular architecture
              essential for asymmetric cell division is likely to reveal universally
              important molecular mechanisms.

Biochemical analysis in mammalian cells
              indicates that the highly conserved cell polarity protein Cdc42 binds to and
              activates the mammalian PAR homologs.  Genetic analysis of cdc-42 function in
              C. elegans early embryos, performed in Dr. Hunter's laboratory, is consistent
              with these results.  Dr. Hunter proposes to investigate how Cdc42 activity
              controls the localization and activity of the PAR proteins during the
              establishment of embryonic polarity.  A transgenic strain expressing a
              PAR-6::GFP fusion protein will be constructed and PAR-6:GFP localization
              followed in living embryos in response to changes in Cdc42 activity.  Equally
              important to how the PAR proteins become asymmetrically localized, is how the
              PAR proteins control cell polarity.  Dr. Hunter proposes a second set of
              experiments to investigate the function of and determine the molecular identity
              of roc(qt1), a gene required to coordinate embryonic polarity with cytoskeletal
              organization.
