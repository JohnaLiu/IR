Abstract    :
              Eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G coordinates ribosomal binding and
              subsequent ribosomal
scanning on the 5'NTR of an mRNA by binding to factors
              that are required for both steps. eIF4G is a
subunit of eIF4F, which also has
              eIF4E (cap-binding protein) and eIF4A (helicase) subunits. This project
will
              characterize the roles of eIF4G and associated factors in these two stages of
              initiation using mRNAs
that depend on either the 5'-terminal cap or an
              internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) for ribosomal
binding. Loading of the 40S
              ribosomal subunit onto mRNA may involve local unwinding of mRNA by
bound eIF4F
              and interaction between eIF4G and ribosome-associated eIF3. The roles of
              eIF4G's
interactions with RNA, eIF4A and eIF3 in ribosomal attachment and
              scanning will be characterized by
integrating biochemical assays (such as
              eIF4G's influence on eIF4A's helicase activity) with
reconstitution of
              initiation on model mRNAs. The role of Ded1p, another RNA helicase that has
              been
implicated in scanning will also be characterized. Initiation on the
              encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)
IRES requires specific binding by eIF4G/4A.
              The mechanisms of recognition of this IRES by eIF4G/4A, of
enhancement of
              binding of eIF4G/4A to related IRESs by specific IRES trans-acting factors, and
              of
promotion of ribosomal attachment by the eIF4G/4A/IRES complex will be
              determined. The cap-binding
activity of eIF4F is down-regulated during mitosis
              and apoptosis when some cellular IRES-containing
mRNAs remain active. The
              hypothesis that these IRESs resemble EMCV in interacting with eIF4G/4A
              to
promote ribosomal binding when eIF4E is inactive will be tested. These
              studies will provide insights
into mechanisms for selective translation of
              specific mRNAs.
