Abstract    :
               This award to WTEC, Inc. is for organization of a workshop at NSF in February
              2001 that will provide a preliminary assessment of U.S. and international
              research activities in quantum information science. Quantum information science
              (QIS) is an emerging field of science and technology that draws on the
              disciplines of physical science, mathematics, computer science, and
              engineering. Its aim is to understand how fundamental laws of quantum mechanics
              can be harnessed to dramatically improve the acquisition, transmission, and
              processing of information. The exciting scientific opportunities offered by QIS
              are attracting the interest of a growing community of scientists and engineers,
              both nationally and internationally. Although the U.S. maintains a leadership
              role in this research, major centers of excellence exist abroad, principally in
              Japan, Europe, and Australia. The goal of the workshop is to gather information
              by a panel of U.S. experts for the purposes of planning a more extensive global
              study of QIS. Its scope is to identify the leading individuals, institutions,
              and centers of excellence in international research and development in the
              field. A full international technology assessment study may then be organized
              separately to complete the major study. Several Divisions in the Directorates
              for Engineering, for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and for Computer and
              Information Science and Engineering at NSF are supporting this award.
