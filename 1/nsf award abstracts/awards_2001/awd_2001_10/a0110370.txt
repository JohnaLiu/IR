Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will continue
              development of a new electrochromic device based on self-assembly of organic
              nanomaterials.  Phase I used these materials to create laboratory scale
              devices.  Precise control of the material composition at the nanometer (nm)
              scale, combined with the thin layers deposited (40 nm thick), allowed switching
              speeds of 25-50 milliseconds for the first time, which are nearly fast enough
              for display applications.  Further, it was found that these materials,
              fabricated in the solid state, could be switched by applying only 1.0 volt. 
              Phase II will focus on optimizing device performance, developing tri-state and
              multi-color devices, and evaluating performance under environmental conditions
              necessary for commercial product development.  

Markets for the technology
              are very large and range from automotive self-dimming rear-view mirrors to
              smart windows for residential and commercial buildings, smart glasses, and
              display products.  Phase III is planned for manufacturing scale-up and will be
              conducted in an industrial partnership.
