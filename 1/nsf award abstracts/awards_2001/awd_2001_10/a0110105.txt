Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
              new optically transparent intrinsically conducting polymer (ICP) that can be
              processed from organic solutions.   Despite much information on ICPs in the
              technical literature, the number of commercial applications of ICPs is still
              very small because of their intrinsically poor stability and the lack of
              reasonable processing methods.   Phase II will address the problem of
              processability.  Phase I successfully prepared ICPs that are soluble up to 15%
              weight in alcohols.  Cast films are optically transparent, have conductivity of
              1-100 Siemens per centimeter, and maintain constant conductivity when elongated
              up to 30%.  ICPs were made from commercially available monomers.  Phase II will
              bring the polymers developed in Phase I from a feasibility stage to commercial
              products by optimizing their composition and synthesis and scaling up
              production and purification. 

These materials could be used to replace
              indium tin oxide in flat panel displays and other electronic applications. 
              ICPs are expected to find application in the manufacture of electronic
              components, inks, biomedical materials, electronic devices, and specialty
              coatings.
