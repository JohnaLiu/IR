Abstract    :
              The Seattle protests against the World Trade Organization not only received much
              media attention, but also demonstrated the growing importance of public
              pressure for political accountability of international economic institutions. 
              The importance of such pressure raises several issues about the relationships
              among domestic social movements, transnational organizations, and international
              institutions.  Social movements face special problems of collective action in
              contending against transnational opponents.   They may deal with the problems
              by organizing domestically against the consequences of global economic actors,
              by supporting transnational umbrella groups, or by creating movement
              organizations that span two or more nations.  This project examines how and why
              domestic activists select certain channels to become transnational
              actors.

In studying the "transnationalization" of social movements, the
              project focuses on five sectors of transnational activism (labor,
              religious/human rights, indigenous groups, global warming, and genetic foods),
              and three international institutions (the United Nations, the European Union,
              and the World Trade Organization).  It creates a quantitative data set from the
              existing archive of the Yearbook of International Organizations, and adds to
              the data set information obtained on protests at international conferences, on
              founding and government funding of activists groups, and on network links among
              domestic movements, transnational organizations, and international
              institutions.  Analysis of the data set allows the investigators and others
              interested in transnational movements to understand how domestic forms of
              contention give way to transnational mobilization.
