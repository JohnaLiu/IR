Interest in solid state chemistry has undergone
              explosive growth in recent years due to the broadly based recognition of the
              technological importance and scientific challenges involved in the discovery
              and study of new materials, and due to the influx of scientists from other
              disciplines who see the opportunities for performing exciting research in this
              area. The 2001 Solid State Chemistry Gordon Research Conference will be held at
              Queens College, Oxford, England  September 16 - September 21, 2001. The goal of
              the conference is to facilitate international collaborations and  information
              exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers with interests in solid state
              chemistry.  The NSF funds will be used to support the attendance of young
              American Scientists as well as senior U.S. session chairs and invited speakers.

The Solid State Chemistry chemistry community continues to have
              direct impact on technological advances of high significance to society by
              designing new materials such as porous solids and molecular sieves, catalysts, 
              and magnetic and electronic materials.
