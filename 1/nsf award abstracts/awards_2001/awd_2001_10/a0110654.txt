Abstract

During nervous system development,
              individual axons navigate through an extremely complex environment to find
              their target cells.  The motile growth cone at the axon tip senses guidance
              cues in the environment and directs growth of the axon.  Although considerable
              work has focused recently on guidance molecule activity, the mechanisms by
              which these molecules function in vivo to coordinate axon pathfinding are
              largely unknown.  Dr. Halloran's research focuses on one family of potential
              axon guidance molecules, the semaphorins.  The semaphorin gene family is highly
              conserved from invertebrates to humans. This suggests that semaphorins have
              crucial functions for embryonic development and survival.  Semaphorins have
              been implicated in the regulation of axon pathfinding, sometimes acting as
              inhibitory guidance molecules, and other times attractive.  The semaphorin gene
              family is very large and diverse, however little is known about the in vivo
              function of most family members.   
	The aim of this proposal is to understand
              the in vivo function of one semaphorin of unknown function, sema3D, and to
              determine how it directs the growth of axons during nervous system development.
               The potential role of sema3D in guiding growth cones of two neuronal types
              will be investigated.  Dr. Halloran's strategy is to manipulate sema3D gene
              expression in the developing zebrafish and analyze the resultant effects on
              axon growth by time-lapse video microscopy of living axons in vivo.  The
              examination of the effects of altered sema3D expression on growing axons should
              reveal how the axons are normally guided by sema3D.  The proposed experiments
              will likely provide novel insights into how semaphorins regulate growth cone
              motile behaviors within the complex in vivo environment.  The ultimate goal is
              to better understand how the wiring of the nervous system is established during
              embryonic development.
