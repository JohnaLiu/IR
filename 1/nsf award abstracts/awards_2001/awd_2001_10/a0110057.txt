Abstract    :
              Copper is essential for normal growth and development of mammalian cells. It
              serves as a cofactor for numerous enzymes mediating neurotransmitter
              biosynthesis, radical detoxification, oxidative phosphorylation, and iron
              transport.  Currently, little is known on how copper became incorporated into
              these proteins and how concentration of copper in a cell is regulated. This
              project addresses these fundamental questions.  The research is focused on
              HAH1, a copper-chaperone, which delivers copper specifically to
              copper-transporting ATPases in mammalian cells.  The long-term goal of the
              studies is to understand how HAH1 functions in a cell, and how its function is
              regulated.  The experimental approach includes combination of protein
              biochemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, protein fragment complementation assay
              in cultured cell lines, and chemical labeling.  These techniques are utilized
              (i) to determine the oligomerization state of intracellular HAH1 in the
              presence of different copper concentrations, (ii) to characterize copper
              occupancy of HAH1 within the cell, and (iii) to determine whether the in vivo
              interactions between HAH1 and the copper-transporting ATPase are regulated by
              changes in copper concentration.  The results of these experiments will
              generate new information regarding key copper transporters in mammalian cells
              and will advance understanding of basic mechanisms regulating intracellular
              copper distribution.
