Abstract    :
              Neurotransmitter-mediated signaling is one of the basic forms of communication
              between neurons and their targets. The release of neurotransmitters from
              neuronal cells is controlled by the so-called SNARE proteins (soluble N-
              ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor). The
              SNAREs are multiple proteins that form a large complex that leads to the fusion
              of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles with cell plasma membranes.  In this
              application, Dr. Yuechueng Liu proposes to dissect the events that involve the
              assembly and disassembly of the SNARE proteins at the molecular level using
              engineered fluorescent SNARE proteins. By measurement of fluorescence changes
              in cells during neurotransmitter release, the interaction of the SNARE proteins
              can be monitored and studied. This research will provide us with fundamental
              knowledge regarding how neuronal cells communicate with each other,  and it
              will ultimately help us to understand many normal and abnormal brain functions
              such as learning and memory, depression, and schizophrenia.
