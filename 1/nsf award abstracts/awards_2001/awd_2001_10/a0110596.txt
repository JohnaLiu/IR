Abstract    :
              Most investigations of molecular evolution examine single genes, without respect
              to their interactions with other genes.  However, most genes do not act in
              isolation, but interact with many other genes, which are likely to influence
              each other's evolution.  One goal of this project is to determine whether and
              how such interactions actually cause predictable variation among genes in their
              rates of evolution.  Specifically, genes of the anthocyanin pigment pathway in
              morning glories (genus Ipomoea) will be examined to determine whether observed
              evolutionary rate variation is due to differences in selective constraint (i.e.
              whether genes downstream in the pathway are less subject to purifying natural
              selection because they influence fewer characters).  A second goal of this
              project is to begin examining the relative importance of regulatory and
              structural genes in adaptive divergence between species by determining the
              molecular basis of phenotypic divergence. The long-term goal of this project is
              to examine a large number of species whose color pattern has diverged from the
              presumed ancestral type of cyanidin-based blue/purple pigmentation throughout
              the corolla limb and throat.  For each species the relative contribution of
              structural and regulatory genes to divergence will be determined.   However,
              the current objective is more limited: to characterize the genetic changes that
              have resulted in the production of white flowers by two species, I. alba and I.
              igualensis.  Initially, investigation will concentrate on these two species to
              demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.
