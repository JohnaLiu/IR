Abstract    :
              Museum collections are the main repository for past and current baseline
              biodiversity information.  In order to utilize that baseline information as
              fully as possible for research and management decisions, the information must
              be available. This project will convert separate collections in Colorado into
              one distributed biodiversity database and research toolkit for the southern and
              central Rockies and adjacent plains.  This area features tremendous biological
              diversity and has experienced and continues to experience many environmental
              changes that impact biodiversity.  The collection involves almost 300,000
              biological specimens.  The format relies upon linking data to a geographic
              information system database.  The system will allow for the query, analysis and
              synthesis of local and network information through a web interface, for
              researchers, managers and educators, as well as the public.
