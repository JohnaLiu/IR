Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes the
              development of a low-cost desktop true three dimensional (3-D) information
              display system suitable for commercialization during Phase III. The proposed
              video monitor will provide highly realistic static and dynamic 3-D images by
              presenting information over a volumetric space, rather than a conventional
              planar space. As a result, the displayed information neither suffers from the
              loss of actual depth information as in a conventional monitor, nor requires the
              use of specially designed eyeglasses needed for stereovision systems. Fullcolor
              true 3-D views will be generated by projecting plane-by-plane image slices onto
              a projection screen that moves backward and forward in synchronization with the
              information generated on a CRT screen. By accessing these planes-of-view 30
              times per second, flicker-free true 3-D views are generated over a volumetric
              space that are viewable from multiple angles. The anticipated low cost of this
              practical system should make it affordable for personal use since it will be
              designed primarily with commercially available system components, aided by
              novel digital imaging techniques and software approaches.

Thus, the proposed
              system is expected to find many diverse applications ranging from scientific
              and industrial visualization to entertainment.  Some of the initial
              applications include biomedical image processing, scientific visualization,
              protein structure determination, general-purpose 3-D computer graphics, radar
              imaging, battlefield management, and aircraft design.
