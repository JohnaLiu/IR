Abstract    :
              Ribonuclease H (RNase H) genes and/or their activities have been identified in
              all systems studied to date ranging from archaebacteria to man.  This suggests
              that they may be one of a limited number of activities required for minimal
              biological life.  Multiple RNase H isoforms exist in prokaryotes and eukaryotes
              and all known for their ability to degrade the RNA strands of RNA:DNA
              heteroduplexes.  This simple function implicates the enzymes in regulating
              RNA:DNA duplex formation during DNA replication, RNA transcription, chromatin
              ultrastructure and viral and cellular reverse transcription.  The existence of
              multiple RNase H isoforms also suggest that what is learned of isoforms in one
              system may relate to our understanding of isoform structure and function
              elsewhere.  The studies described here are broadly significant in scope,
              impacting conserved and novel roles for ribonucleases H in all biological
              systems.  Furthermore,they exploit the genetics of Trypanosoma brucei, a system
              that has been the prototype for unmasking unusual nucleic acid metabolic events
              such as RNA editing and RNA trans-splicing.
