Abstract    :
              The introduction of double-stranded RNA into cells from a variety organisms,
              including plants, nematodes, flies, protozoans, and mammals causes potent and
              specific post-transcriptional gene silencing.  In animals, this is called RNA
              interference (RNAi). It has been hypothesized that the natural role of RNAi may
              be to protect the germ line from viruses, transposons, and other molecular
              parasites.  A mysterious aspect of RNAi is that gene-specific information is
              communicated between cells, that is RNAi is systemic.  The goal of this project
              is to identify and characterize C. elegans mutants that either enhance or
              suppress systemic RNAi, but do not affect autonomous RNAi.  A transgenic strain
              has been constructed that allows direct monitoring of systemic RNAi of a
              GFP-reporter gene.  This strain will be mutagenized and animals with a
              suppressed or enhanced systemic RNAi response will be isolated and
              characterized genetically and molecularly.  Selected genes will then be cloned
              and the expression and function of their products will be further
              characterized.
