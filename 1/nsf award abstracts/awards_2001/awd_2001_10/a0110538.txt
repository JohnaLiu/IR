Abstract    :
              This project will make direct measurements of the production rate of radiocarbon
              in the atmosphere by exposing a known amount radiocarbon free air to
              atmospheric radiation at a known altitude (near 16 km), latitude, and longitude
              using a balloon platform.  This is the first time that the production rate will
              be directly measured in the atmosphere near the level of maximum production. 
              The measured rate will be compared directly with those previously calculated by
              extrapolation from thermal neutron measurements.  An accurate measurement of
              the production rate is needed for using radiocarbon as a tracer of global
              hydroxyl radical distribution, and for developing a better understanding of the
              global carbon cycle.
