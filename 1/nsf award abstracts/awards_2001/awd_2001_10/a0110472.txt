Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will use a novel
              high throughput platform comprising of many, small gene arrays, contained
              within the wells of microtiter plates.  This platform, termed Multi-Array Plate
              Screening (MAPS), allows simultaneous testing of the expression of a specific
              group of genes of interest and appropriate controls using RNA derived from 96
              separate samples, within each well of a 96-well plate. MAPS provides the
              endpoint assay for a high throughput screen, in which investigators can
              evaluate how different chemical compounds, applied to cells, tissues, or
              organisms in vivo, affect the expression pattern for the genes of
              interest.

This technology will address an unmet need of the agricultural
              industry to make efficient use of novel genomics information in a manner that
              does not require distribution of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the
              form of transgenic plants. The plants are grown in each well of a 96 well plate
              to facilitate high-throughput screening. The platform allows facile and
              efficient testing of gene targets including newly identified genes, and also
              provides important information about selectivity and specificity.  The
              commercial potential from this project is in the agricultural market.
