The process of cell differentiation is the process by which
              cells become specialized during the development of multicellular organisms. 
              Although a great deal is known about how cell differentiation is initiated,
              considerably less is known about how these early events control the actual
              events leading to cellular specialization.  The shoot epidermal hairs
              (trichomes) of Arabidopsis are now well established as a model for the study of
              plant cell differentiation.  The long-term goal of this research program is to
              uncover the molecular mechanisms connecting the trichome cell fate decision to
              the generation of the mature trichome phenotype.  There is particular interest
              in the endoreduplication cell cycle during trichome development.  The specific
              goals of the proposed research are to identify direct downstream targets of the
              trichome initation regulators GL3 and GL1, to isolate the SIM gene and
              determine its function in the endoreduplication cell cycle, and to isolate
              extragenic modifiers of sim mutants.
