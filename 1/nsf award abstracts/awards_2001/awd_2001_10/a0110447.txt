Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop
              advanced magnetorheological fluids for various damping applications.  The Phase
              I project focused on a microwave plasma synthesis technique (NANOGENTM) and
              chemical precipitation technique; both techniques were successfully used to
              synthesize nanoparticles of iron, cobalt and iron oxide.  NANOGENTM was
              selected as one of the 100 most innovative technologies in 1998 when it won the
              prestigious R&D 100 Award.  MR fluids were prepared from these fluids and
              preliminary results on their damping behavior was found to be comparable with
              commercially available fluids.  The Phase II project will scale-up the
              production of nanopowders and will conduct testing of their damping
              characteristics to help foster the development and application of MR fluids in
              key technology driven areas.

The possible commercial applications will be in
              automobile suspensions, hybrid actuator valves, semi-active vibration control
              in turbines and bridges as well as for seismic damping.
