Abstract    :
              Life science data is valuable and hard to produce; it is important to share it
              in order to promote discovery. Effective database interoperability will
              facilitate the way life science data is accessed, retrieved, analyzed, and
              combined with other data.  The original effort with focus on life science data,
              specifically databases concerned with four organisms, a plant, an animal, an
              insect and a simple eukaryote.  General purpose databases of sequence and
              structure will also be integrated. The provision of methods for integrating
              proprietary data as well as public data will enable collaborations with
              industry.  The system is based on a mediator-wrapper approach, which will be
              automated through wrapper induction, by using a domain ontology and independent
              source data models.  The system will help overcome the scalability, maintenance
              and upgrade challenges in many life science databases.
