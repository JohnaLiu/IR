Abstract    :
              The proposed research will use the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model
              system for the evolution of water balance in insects. A total of 27
              populations, derived from three collection sites, will be studied. Nine
              populations will be selected for resistance to desiccation stress, and 18 will
              serve as controls for the selection treatment. Physiological characters
              associated with desiccation resistance (water content, water loss, metabolic
              rate, activity) will be assayed at intervals of ten generations. Genetic
              differences between populations will be investigated using DNA microarrays
              (gene chips). Genes that are turned on or off in response to water stress will
              be identified, as well as other genes that contribute to desiccation
              resistance. By integrating physiological and genetic studies, it will be
              possible to relate specific changes in gene expression to physiological
              mechanisms of desiccation resistance. These experiments will also be used to
              identify new physiological mechanisms by identifying novel genes that respond
              to selection, and thereby to learn more about how insects and other organisms
              respond to environmental stress.
