Abstract    :
                 Control of reproductive development in mammals is quite complex.  The primary
              regulatory level is the hypothalamus in the brain, containing neurons (nerve
              cells) that synthesize and release gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).  GnRH
              is released in a pulsatile manner to the pituitary gland to activate the
              reproductive axis.  Before puberty, GnRH release is low, but during puberty and
              maturation, increases in pulsatile GnRH release occur, and are much more
              dramatic during the night than the day.  This project uses a physiological
              approach to deliver timed GnRH doses, to determine whether the nocturnal high
              release is obligatory for pubertal development, how the brain controls the
              timing of the pulsatile release, and the role of age in the pubertal increase
              in nocturnal GnRH release.
    Results will be important in understanding
              regulation of the onset of puberty and important for vertebrate reproduction
              beyond mammals.  The project also has a substantial component of student
              training in a lab with an excellent record of mentoring.
