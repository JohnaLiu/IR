	This award provides partial-funding support for a workshop
              to discuss research facilities needed by the mineral physics research community
              and to begin the process of defining a consortium organization to manage those
              shared facilities. The workshop is to be held 2-4 February 2001 at the
              Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at the University of California,
              San Diego.
