Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will design,
              build, and test a hybrid Raman analyzer suitable for "on-demand" or continuous
              process monitoring.  The Phase I project demonstrated feasibility by designing
              and testing a unique combination of components that yielded greater than 100
              times improvement in sensitivity (defined as the signal-to-noise ratio)
              compared to traditional Raman analyzers. The novel design also demonstrated
              high resolution (1 cm -1), invariant wavelength stability, and freedom from
              fluorescence interference; which are critical requirements for autonomous
              chemical process monitoring or rapid raw-material identification.  The Phase II
              project will further improve sensitivity, as well as demonstrate long-term
              temperature and vibrational immunity, and fast "turn-on" time.  Complete
              internal analyzer diagnostics will allow greater than 1000 hours of unattended
              operation.  As such, the analyzer will be rugged, compact and portable (10"x
              12" footprint), low-maintenance, require minimum power, and suitable for
              numerous industrial applications. 

The commercial applications will be
              directed toward the chemical manufacturing industries. The Phase II prototype
              will be used to develop specific applications with customers during Phase
              III.
