Abstract    :
              Simple and complex animals, including humans, are always faced with the need to
              decide wisely upon actions using incomplete information. How the nervous system
              is organized to do this has been a major puzzle. However, we know that animals
              make most decisions using their own affective state as information, and that in
              their computations they integrate their own internal state with sensation and
              experience to arrive at decisions. The result represents a cost-benefit
              analysis of a behavioral decision in terms of probable benefit, resource loss
              and possible self-damage. This proposal describes plans to study the neural
              basis of cost-benefit analysis in decision-making in foraging behavior using a
              model predator species with simple body form, behavior and nervous system.
              Three goals are outlined: 1) to find how satiation and prey-avoidance learning
              influence decision-making mechanisms in the nervous system for attack or
              avoidance; 2) to determine the role of serotonin, a critical biasing factor, in
              the mechanisms of decision-making; and 3) to summarize and test the results in
              a computational model of the neural networks. The expected results are
              significant to the development of autonomous robots capable of making
              least-probable-error decisions in a noisy environment, and to the evolution of
              artificial intelligence for which motivation-based processes may provide the
              critical regulation of goal related activity, just as in real intelligence
              systems. The results also relate directly to health issues of weight-control in
              anorexia and obesity, in that they approach the organization of processes
              regulating nutritional homeostasis.
