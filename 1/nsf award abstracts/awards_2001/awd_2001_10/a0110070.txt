The primary goal of this proposal is to develop techniques to
              image  two colors simultaneously at video rates (>30 frames/sec) so that either
              two different probes, or a single probe with two different emissions, can be
              imaged synchronously. Further, to develop the techniques for using multiple
              lasers for excitation. This goal will allow two different kinds of studies:
              First, it would allow multiple proteins to be studied in a single cell. This is
              important for addressing questions of protein-protein interactions. Second, it
              will allow many physiological studies using dual-emission dyes that can be used
              to quantify important cell signaling molecules such as calcium or pH. The
              spatial and temporal dynamics of these molecules are key for understanding many
              aspects of cellular signaling.
