Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
              innovations pertaining to optrodes (optical sensors) and electro-optical
              instrumentation for advanced material characterization.  Specifically, this
              project will develop the first commercially available high-resolution
              volumetric dilatometer.  In addition, the innovations will allow for: (1) a
              linear dilatometer that possesses a resolution that is 2-3 orders of magnitude
              better than its conventional linear counterparts; (2) an optical control system
              for micro-translation stages; (3) an optrode for thin film characterization
              that possesses a linear resolution exceeding 1 nanometer; and (4) an
              ultra-fast, high-resolution spectrometer that will enable commercialization of
              three optical sensors (pressure, temperature, and load) suitable for harsh
              environments.

Potential commercial applications are expected in electronics
              and microelectronics manufacturing for dilatometry, thin films analysis,
              micro-translation stages, ultra-fast spectroscopy, and various optical
              sensors.
