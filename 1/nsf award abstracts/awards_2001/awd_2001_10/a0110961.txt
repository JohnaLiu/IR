Abstract    :
                 Thyroid hormones have profound effects on growth and development of many cell
              types (including brain cells) and also regulate the basal metabolic rate and
              other functions of adult tissues.  The actions of thyroid hormones in brain
              were believed to be limited to effects on gene expression during the early
              developmental period, but new evidence has shown that the hormones can
              influence the adult brain.  Biochemical and molecular approaches are used to
              study the mechanism of actions of thyroid hormone in adult central nervous
              system.  Using a synaptosomal preparation of brain tissue without cell nuclei,
              the details of regulation of protein phosphorylation by thyroid hormones will
              be examined.  The research will increase the understanding of a novel mechanism
              of action of thyroid hormones in adult brain.
   The significance of the
              findings will extend beyond the field of neuroendocrinology to add to the
              general comprehension of cell signaling pathways in cell biology.   The project
              also offers undergraduates opportunities for neuroendocrinology research
              training in a laboratory that has an excellent history of such education.
