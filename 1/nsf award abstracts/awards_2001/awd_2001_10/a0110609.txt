Although the major event of fertilization is known to be the
              release of intracellular calcium, the exact cause of this calcium release is
              unknown.  Activation of phospholipase C appears to be required for the release
              of calcium at fertilization; however, it is not known how this enzyme is
              activated.  One possible path to activation of phospholipase C may be through
              another lipid signaling path.  In an effort to quantify various lipid signaling
              paths, it has been noted that the mass of sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine
              and phosphatidylinositol decrease whereas choline, IP3, DAG and phosphatidic
              acid increase (phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine do not change)
              during Xenopus fertilization.  From these data and others, it is suggested that
              phospholipase D plays an important role in fertilization.  Phosphatidic acid is
              a product of the reaction catalyzed by phospholipase D.  Phosphatidic acid may
              be required for membrane fusion events (e.g.: sperm-egg merger, cortical
              granule-plasma membrane merger) and the DAG increase (since phosphatidic acid
              can be dephosphorylated to DAG) at fertilization.  Most importantly,
              phosphatidic acid binds to and activates phospholipase C; thus, phosphatidic
              acid from sperm or that produced in the newly formed zygote may induce the
              central event of fertilization: the increase in intracellular calcium. Through
              the use of exogenous phosphatidic acid, or inhibition of phospholipase D, the
              role of this enzyme and the product phosphatidic acid in fertilization will be
              examined.
