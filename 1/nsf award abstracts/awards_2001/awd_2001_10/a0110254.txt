Abstract    :
              PlantGDB is a database of plant genomic sequences, in particular Expressed
              Sequence Tags (ESTs) that correspond to fragments of genes that are actively
              transcribed under particular conditions.  The database organizes the ESTs into
              contigs that represent tentative unique genes.  The contigs are annotated and,
              whenever possible, linked to their genomic DNA origins.  The PlantGDB web site
              includes a number of bioinformatics tools that facilitate gene prediction and
              cross-species comparisons.  The database will provide snapshots of the current
              knowledge of plant gene composition and facilitate our understanding of plant
              genetics and evolution.
