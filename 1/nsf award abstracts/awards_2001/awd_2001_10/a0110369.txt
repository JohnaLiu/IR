Abstract    :
              Professor Paul Barbara of the University of Texas at Austin is supported by the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study single molecule
              spectroscopy of organic polymer films, including poly-phenylene-vinylene
              polymer, a fluorescent conjugated polymer.  Among the other systems to be
              examined are photo-driven polymeric motors and model single-molecule photonic
              devices.  Polymer conformation, conformational relaxation, photophysics and
              chain-chain interactions are some of the issues.  Ultrapure conducting polymers
              are to be prepared and their photophysics studied in the presence of charges,
              as in a LED device.   The PI proposes to attempt femtosecond time-resolved
              measurements on these single molecules.

The materials to be studied are
              important in electro-optic, opto-electronic and photovoltaic applications.
