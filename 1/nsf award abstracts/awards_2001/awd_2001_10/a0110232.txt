Abstract    :
              Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) synthesis from adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP)
              and inorganic phosphate (Pi) is catalyzed by closely related enzymes in the
              energy transducing membranes of chloroplasts, mitochondria and some bacteria.
              Electron transport generates electrochemical proton gradients across the
              coupling membranes and the flow of protons down these gradients through the ATP
              synthase drives ATP synthesis. The chloroplast ATP synthase contains nine
              different polypeptides and a total of about twenty polypeptide chains.  The
              enzyme may be separated into two parts: CF1 and CFo.  CF1 contains the
              nucleotide binding sites of the enzyme and is catalytic.  CFo anchors CF1 to
              the membrane and translocates protons.  Interactions among the polypeptide
              subunits of CF1 and CFo will be studied, with emphasis on the smaller subunits
              of CF1 (gamma, delta and epsilon) and the regulation of activity.  This project
              will examine roles of the binding of nucleotides in regulation. The location of
              the C-terminal domain of the e subunit within CF1 and its roles in ATP
              synthesis, regulation and proton gating will be evaluated making extensive use
              of site-directed mutagenesis. Whether the position of the C-terminal portion of
              the g subunit in CF1 differs from that in mitochondrial F1 will be
              investigated. The ease of preparation of large amounts of CF1, ability to
              manipulate its subunit composition and nucleotide content, and the high ATP
              synthesis activity of thylakoids, make the chloroplast ATP synthase an
              excellent subject for this research.  The results of this work will be
              applicable to all ATP synthases and to protein-protein interactions, in
              general.
