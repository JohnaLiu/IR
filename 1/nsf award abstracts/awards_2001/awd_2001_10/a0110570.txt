Abstract    :
              

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop
              a reliable prototype of a novel, compact and low cost solar air conditioning
              system for hot and humid climates. The system will consist of an air-cooled
              single effect absorption machine driven by an array of high performance flat
              plate collectors and a thermal storage tank. A microncontroller based control
              system will allow an optimal system operation. The capacity of the system is
              projected to be in the range of 3-5 cooling tons. 

The marketing,
              manufacturing, installation, and product development of the proposed technology
              is envisioned as a partnership of three small businesses dedicated to: 
              installation of A/C systems, marketing  and manufacturing of solar collectors,
              and to research.
