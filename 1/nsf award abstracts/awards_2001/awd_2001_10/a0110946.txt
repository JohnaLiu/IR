Abstract    :
              This project studies borrowing constraints and their implications for
              firm
growth and survival. Recent empirical work suggests that
              financial
constraints are an important determinant of the evolution of small
              and young
firms.  As repayment of loans cannot be always guaranteed,
              long-term
contracts can often provide better incentives to borrowers. Applying
              recent
advances in contract theory, this project considers the optimal design
              of
such long-term lending contracts. Implications for firm dynamics --growth
              and
survival-- of small and young firms are considered.
