Abstract    :
              This proposal requests continued support for biophysical studies of the
              mechanism of the charge separation and recombination steps in photosynthetic
              reaction centers (RCs) and the higher-order organization of photosynthetic
              membranes. An important part of our work involves the development of new
              experimental and theoretical methods that can have a broad impact in other
              areas of science and biotechnology. Understanding the mechanisms of energy and
              electron transfer in photosynthetic systems has proven to be an exceptionally
              fertile area for such developments and for training scientists. In this
              project, research will be performed in the following specific areas that relate
              to the mechanism of charge separation in the reaction center: (i) determination
              of the fundamental parameters that control alternative electron transfer
              pathways initiated by excitation of the monomeric bacteriochlorophyll on the
              functional side using resonance Stark spectroscopy; (ii) application of the
              resonance Stark method to other pathways created by engineering the RC; (iii)
              measurements of the activation energy and magnetic field dependence of the
              decay of the special pair triplet state to determine the energetics of the
              primary charge separation in RC mutants; (iv) attachment of spectator dye
              molecules near the functional components to probe the dynamics of charge motion
              during the first electron transfer step(s); (v) organization of components in
              the photosynthetic membrane in supported bilayers. By integrating this range of
              approaches, our understanding of the mechanism of initial electron transfer and
              the related phenomenon of unidirectional electron transfer can be advanced and
              brought into the larger context of structure-function relationships in complex
              biological assemblies.
