LAY SUMMARY

Terrestrial
              salamanders have a unique system of chemical communication.  This system
              features non-volatile pheromones (chemical signals) that a male delivers to the
              female during courtship.  The male courtship pheromone is produced by an
              enlarged gland under the male's chin, and the male taps this gland on the
              female's nose in order to deliver his pheromone.  In their subsequent
              evolutionary history, plethodontids modified this pheromone delivery system in
              a variety of ways, including delivery methods in which the pheromone is
              "injected" into the female's circulatory system.  This chemical communication
              system -unique among vertebrates- has been retained by diverse groups of
              plethodontids throughout their evolutionary radiation.  
Recently, it has been
              established that the plethodontid pheromone increases female sexual
              receptivity, as indicated by courtships that are completed more rapidly.  It
              also has been determined that the pheromone is a protein.  The amino acid
              sequence of this protein has been identified, as well as the nucleotide
              sequence of the gene that produces the pheromone protein.  Furthermore, it has
              been established that the pheromone protein is in a cytokine family that
              includes interferons and interleukins.  The phylogenetic setting for these
              discoveries offers an outstanding opportunity to investigate the evolution of
              the causal pathway from gene to protein to behavior.  This project embraces a
              conceptual framework that is generally applicable to the study of evolutionary
              change in communication systems at multiple levels of organization.
