Abstract    :
              Ant agriculture, exemplified by the symbiosis between fungus-growing (attine)
              ants and their fungal cultivars, is intensively studied as a model system for
              understanding the general ecological and coevolutionary mechanisms that shape
              highly integrated symbioses. The attine ant agricultural symbiosis encompasses
              both mutualistic and parasitic interactions between (1) ant farmers, (2) fungal
              cultivars, (3) parasitic fungal "weeds" that infest ant gardens, and (4)
              antibiotic-producing bacteria that control the garden parasites and are
              cultured on the bodies of ants.  This project specifically explores the
              ecological complexity of the attine ant-fungus-bacterium symbiosis and
              elucidates its 50-million-year coevolutionary history by testing hypotheses
              posed at multiple ecological and evolutionary levels, including: (1) the local
              ecological level within ant colonies; (2) the population and community levels;
              (3) the biogeographic level; and the phylogenetic level, including (4)
              coevolutionary processes and historical ecology; (5) symbiont-mediated
              speciation; and (6) the effects of symbiotic life histories on rates of
              evolutionary change.  Because symbiosis is a major recurring theme in the
              history of life, this research is expected to generate general insights into
              the broad mechanisms that drive biological complexity and diversity.  Such
              insights could in some cases impact issues directly relevant to human welfare,
              including the evolution of antibiotic resistance and the practice of
              sustainable agriculture.
