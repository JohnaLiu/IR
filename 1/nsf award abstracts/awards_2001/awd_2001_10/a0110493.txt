Abstract    :
              Daniel L. Reger, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of South
              Carolina at Columbia, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
              Organometallic Chemistry Program for his work developing new metal complexes of
              tris(pyrazoyl)methane (tpm) ligands. These ligands are closely related to
              tris(pyrazoyl)borates, but have been much more difficult to prepare. Reger has
              developed new synthetic pathways to tpm ligands such as HC(pz)3,
              HC(3,5-Me2pz)3, HC(3-Phpz)3, HC(3-tBupz)3 and HC(3-iPrpz)3.  Linked bi- and
              poly-functional pyrazoyl methane ligands, such as all three isomers of
              C6H4[CH2OCH2C(pz)3]2, will form building blocks for the preparation of
              coordination polymers that have unusual 2-D or 3-D supramolecular structures.
              

Metal complexes of tpm ligands may show unique reactivity or catalytic
              activity. The coordination polymers, especially those containing two different
              metals, will have interesting physical or electronic properties. In addition,
              several graduate students and faculty members, including coworkers from a HBCU
              undergraduate institution, will have the opportunity to participate in the
              research project.
