Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
              platinum-transition metal alloy catalysts that are supported on high area
              carbon for oxygen cathodes in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. The Phase II
              project will build on the success of Phase I by optimizing the alloy
              composition and particle size of supported Platinum (Pt) alloy catalysts for
              efficient oxygen reduction.  Low temperature synthesis methods allow T/J
              Technologies to produce supported Pt alloys with minimal Pt aggregation.  Alloy
              compositions that reduce the over potential toward oxygen reduction by >50 mV
              versus Pt alone and will be produced with particles sizes (3-5 nm) that
              maximize Pt utilization and oxygen reduction efficiency. Performance will be
              demonstrated in half-cell and full fuel cell experiments.  Catalysts resulting
              from this project will enable PEM fuel cells to operate more
              efficiently.

The potential commercial applications from this project would
              be improved oxygen reduction catalysts for proton exchange membrane fuel cells
              for vehicle propulsion and kilowatt-scale off-grid electric power generation.
              These are potentially large markets with beneficial impacts on energy
              efficiency, international competitiveness, and emissions reductions.
