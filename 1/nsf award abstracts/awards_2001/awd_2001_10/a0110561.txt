The objective of the proposed workshop is to develop an on-line
              hydroclimate data library through a coordinated multi-national effort.  We
              anticipate that a position paper on the need for such a library, and desirable
              features (including data processing algorithms) and capabilities, will be
              prepared through remote interaction between some of the invitees and circulated
              in advance of the meeting.  The two-day meeting will then focus on a discussion
              of this position paper, strategies for implementation and funding, and the
              development of one or more community proposals for different portions of the
              work identified.  A strategy to integrate the technology developed from the
              project into the electronic data libraries of the USGS and other agencies will
              be developed as part of these deliberations.  The recommendations of the
              workshop will be summarized in an article in EOS.  The same article will also
              seek additional comments and expression of interest in participation from the
              community.  This workshop will be held at the Lamont-Doherty, Earth
              Observatory, Palisades, New York in April 2001.
