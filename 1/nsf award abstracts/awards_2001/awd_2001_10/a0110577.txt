The main objective of the Gordon Research Conference on
              Nuclear
Chemistry is to provide the international community of
              nuclear
scientists with a unique forum in which the newest developments at
              the
forefront of this science can be presented and subjected to detailed
              and
extended discussions and criticism.  The purpose of the conference is
              to
encourage communication and the discussions to be conducted in
              an
atmosphere conducive to open interactions between the
              scientists,
provoking new and even speculative ideas for future research. 
              To
accomplish these goals requires the participation in all of the
conference
              activities of a significant number of leaders in the field.
However, a science
              as rapidly developing as nuclear chemistry invites
and needs cooperative
              efforts on all levels, including efforts both
national and worldwide in scope.
               The participation of younger
scientists is essential to address the future
              manpower needs of this
rapidly changing field.  Therefore, bright and
              promising postdoctoral
researchers and graduate students have been specially
              selected for
participation in this conference and encouraged to present their
              ideas. 
Their participation in this conference provides them with unique
              and
extensive access to the leaders in their field, exposes them to
              new
research opportunities and techniques and helps prepare them for
              the
leadership roles they will assume in the future.  This award
              will
facilitate participation from these junior scientists.
