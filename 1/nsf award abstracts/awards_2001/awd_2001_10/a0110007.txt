Abstract    :
              High salt in plant growth media causes ion imbalance and hyperosmotic stress. 
              As a consequence of these primary effects, secondary stresses such as oxidative
              damage often occur.  Plant responses to salt stress are very complex, and
              understanding of salt tolerance mechanisms remains a formidable challenge in
              agriculture as well as in basic plant biology.  Halophytes are naturally salt
              tolerant plants that have evolved efficient salt tolerance mechanisms.  The
              proposed research aims to dissect salt tolerance mechanisms in halophytes by
              using the genetically tractable halophilic plant, saltcress (Thellungiella
              halophila).  Several orthologs of Arabidopsis genes involved in salt tolerance
              will be cloned from saltcress.  The cloned genes will be knocked out in
              saltcress by using the technology of RNA interference.  Saltcress mutants thus
              constructed can be evaluated phenotypically in salt tolerance assays.  The
              proposed studies will help understand how halophytes tolerate salt stress.
