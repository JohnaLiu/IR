Abstract    :
              Dr. Charles Winter (PI) of the Department of Chemistry, Wayne State University,
              and Dr. Judith Stein (co-PI) are supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
              Organometallic Chemistry program of the Division of Chemistry, National Science
              Foundation, to host the 2001, 2002 and 2003 NSF-sponsored Annual Inorganic
              Workshops. The purpose of these workshops is to assemble researchers from
              different geographical areas and broad diversity at different stages of their
              careers to encourage informal and detailed discussion of in progress
              investigations. The workshops will focus on emerging ideas, new techniques, and
              unsolved problems.

The workshops will bring together inorganic chemists,
              particularly the younger chemists at the Assistant and Associate Professor
              levels to give them an occasion to "test" their ideas on more senior chemists.
              An annual report will be made available to the NSF IBO program and to the
              community based on input from the participants on the "status of inorganic
              chemistry research" to provide NSF and the responsible program with insight
              into emerging research areas.
