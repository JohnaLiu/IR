Abstract    :
              This grant will provide partial support for the sixth consecutive FASEB Summer
              Research Conference on "Chromatin and Transcription," to be held on July 7-12,
              2001, at the Conference Center in Snowmass Village, Colorado.  The goal of this
              highly successful series of meetings is to foster interactions between
              researchers who study DNA-templated processes with individuals who study
              chromatin structure and organization.  These disciplines are moving together at
              a rapid pace and are providing much new information for the basic biological
              sciences. The meeting's central topic is the relationship between chromatin and
              transcription. The regulation of chromatin impacts other critical biological
              areas; for instance, there are important links between chromatin and nuclear
              structure, chromosome organization, and the cell cycle, particularly relating
              to recent discoveries about histone modification.  Moreover, questions of
              genomic stability and instability, which are relevant to genetic disease, will
              be addressed in a session on developmental/epigenetic regulation. The timing
              and location of the 2001 conference are ideal for productive and interactive
              discussions about data in these rapidly evolving areas.  NSF support will be
              used to help new and young investigators to attend the meeting and present
              their results in an oral format.
