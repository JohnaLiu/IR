Plant cells have many cell types with specialized
              functions. It is generally accepted that the microtubule and filamentous actin
              cytoskeletons are required to generate the cell shapes that have functional
              significance. Dr. Szymanski is proposing to use Arabidopsis leaf trichome
              development to better understand cell shape control. Trichomes are unicellular,
              polarized epidermal cells. Normal trichome morphogenesis is highly regulated
              and includes unique requirements for both the microtubule and actin-filament
              cytoskeletons. The "distorted group" of trichome mutants are specifically
              affected in actin-dependent cellular morphogenesis. The long-term goal of the
              research is to use the distorted mutants to elucidate the mechanisms of
              actin-dependent cell morphogenesis. The primary objective of this proposal is
              to define the cellular reorganization events that occur during trichome growth,
              and identify the responsible genes. The central hypothesis of this proposal is
              that the distorted mutants define a pathway of genes that are involved in
              actin-dependent cellular organization. The plan is to test the central
              hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: To
              determine the chronology and pattern of major cytoskeletal and organelle
              reorganization events that occur during the transition from microtubule to
              actin-dependent morphogenesis. 
Specific aim 2: To identify, map, and measure
              the trichome defects of all of the distorted group mutants. 
Reorganization of
              the actin cytoskeleton in response to developmental and environmental cues is
              fundamentally important to plant cells. Results from this research will provide
              important information about the in vivo function of actin in living plant
              cells.
