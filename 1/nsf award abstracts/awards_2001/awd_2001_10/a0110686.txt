Abstract    :
                 Molecular compounds in the brain called neuropeptides often regulate
              physiological functions, acting similarly to hormones.  A new member of the
              family of neuropeptides known as galanins recently has been isolated in mammals
              and called galanin-like peptide (GALP).  Preliminary evidence suggests that
              GALP plays a role in the neuroendocrine regulation of pituitary functions, but
              little is yet known about the functions of this compound. This project uses
              neuroanatomical, physiological and molecular biological techniques to reveal
              the anatomical circuitry of the cells containing GALP, to discover how and
              where the expression of GALP occurs, and to develop a mutant mouse model with a
              targeted deletion of the GALP gene to reveal physiological functions.  Results
              of these studies should provide a novel understanding of possible roles for
              this molecule in physiological processes such as regulation of metabolism, body
              weight, reproduction, lactation and growth.
   This exploratory project has
              both high risk and high potential impact.  It remains unknown what the specific
              discoveries will be, but novel data are likely to have major importance,
              extending beyond neuroendocrinology to regulatory physiology and developmental
              biology.  Graduate and postdoctoral training will also be done in a laboratory
              with a long record of excellence.
