Abstract    :
              0110877	
This project focuses on structural studies designed to reveal the
              mechanisms of action and of regulation of
              3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) and 3-deoxy-D-
              manno-2-octulosonate-8-phosphate synthase (KDOPS) from E. coli. This work will
              complement mutational and biochemical analysis of the enzymes carried out
              collaboratively in the laboratory of departmental colleague and co-PI, Ronald
              Bauerle. DAHPS catalyzes the first step of aromatic
biosynthesis, the
              condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and D-erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P).
              KDOPS catalyzes the condensation of PEP and D-arabinose-5-phosphate, an
              essential step in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. The two enzymes are distant
              homologs, possessing similar (beta/alpha)8 barrel folds. However, the three
              DAHPS isozymes differ from KDOPS in that they require a divalent metal for
              activation and are regulated by feedback inhibition, each being sensitive to a
              different one of the three aromatic amino acids. The following goals will be
              pursued during the project period: (1) to refine and analyze the crystal
              structure of DAHPS(Phe) complexed with Mn 2+, PEP and its feedback inhibitor,
              phenylalanine, and to compare the structure of this complex with those of
              structures already determined - [Mn*PEP], [Mn*PEP], [Mn*PGL], [Pb*PEP], and
              [Cd*PEP]; (2) to determine and refine the crystal structure of
              DAHPS(Trp)*Mn*PEP, which has already been crystallized; (3) to determine the
              crystal structures of DAHPS(Phe)*Mn complexed with analogs of PEP and of E4P,
              as indicated by the modeling studies of collaborator, M. Krauss; (4) to
              crystallize and determine the crystal structure(s) of mutant DAHPS(Phe) enzymes
              generated in Bauerle's lab whose characterictics are not consistent with our
              model of action and regulation; and (5) to crystallize and determine the
              crystal structure(s) of DAHPS/KDOPS chimeras generated in Bauerle's lab that
              have enzymatic activity.
