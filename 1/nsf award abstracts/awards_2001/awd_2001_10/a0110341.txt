Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further
              develop, test, and demonstrate a novel approach for characterizing nano-scale
              powders and their agglomerates. Nanostructures are a novel family of materials
              that allow customization of structural, electrochemical, electrical,
              electronic, optical, magnetic, and chemical properties. The use of
              nanomaterials to fabricate valuable devices and to manufacture new products
              depends in large part on the ability to characterize these materials during
              synthesis, processing, and device production. Current high resolution
              characterization techniques are off line, slow, expensive, and unreliable; the
              few on-line particle sizing instruments available make questionable assumptions
              (e.g., that all particles are spherical in shape) which introduce unnecessary
              error into the diagnosis. 

The commercial applications of this project is to
              use nano-scale powders, which are the fundamental building blocks of many
              products used in a wide variety of industries (e.g., advanced ceramics,
              pharmaceuticals, consumer products, etc.). As the technology develops, the
              application areas will increase. The ability to characterize nano-scale
              particles and agglomerates on-line is crucial for controlling the quality of
              products and for the invention of new products and processes. In addition,
              characterization of environmental particulates is critical for understanding
              air quality concerns and health effects - leading to improve clean air
              regulations and monitoring.
