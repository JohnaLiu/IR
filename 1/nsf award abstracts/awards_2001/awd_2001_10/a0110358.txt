Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will develop a
              compact cloud spectrometer and impactor (CSI) for the measurement and study of
              condensed water in the atmosphere.  Condensed water includes cloud droplets and
              ice particles.  Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of integrating a
              counterflow virtual impactor (CVI) for condensed water content (CWC)
              measurement together with a new forward scattering spectrometer system for
              measurement of the cloud droplet size distribution.  This combined airborne
              instrument will be considerably  lighter than previous versions of the two
              separate instruments, and easier to use.  The objective of Phase II is a
              commercial, integrated instrument for the study of atmospheric condensed water
              content and droplet size distribution.

The accurate measurement of these
              parameters is important in weather prediction as well as understanding global
              climate change.  This instrumentation will have worldwide application, and the
              users will be government, university, and commercial atmospheric research
              institutions.
