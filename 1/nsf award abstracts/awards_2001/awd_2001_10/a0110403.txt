Abstract    :
              Ribosome biogenesis is one of the few biological processes at the crux of cell
              division.  The long-term goal of this research is to uncover the diverse
              mechanisms essential to the RNA processing events that occur during ribosome
              biogenesis.  The objective of this particular project is to understand the
              first steps in processing of the precursors to the 5.8S and 25S large subunit
              rRNAs.  The central hypothesis is that the Rlp7 protein (Rlp7p) constitutes one
              member of a novel complex that carries out the early pre-rRNA processing
              reactions that generate the 5.8S and 25S large subunit rRNAs.  The rationale
              for this research is to attain an understanding of a new class of RNA binding
              proteins and how they function in RNA processing, which is likely to reveal the
              underlying RNA processing mechanisms.  The research is innovative because it
              will lead to the elucidation of the function of previously uncharacterized
              proteins in RNA processing events that are poorly understood.  This, in turn,
              will lead to a greater comprehension of the role of nucleolar factors in cell
              growth in size.  The results will be significant because cell growth in size is
              critical to cell division.  

This research is focused on understanding the
              molecular basis for how a cell grows in size before it divides.  It is a
              process common to unicellular organisms such as baker's yeast and to
              multicellular organisms such as humans.  The project will elucidate the
              function of newly discovered proteins in cell growth.
