Abstract    :
              Plant MADS-box genes encode transcriptional regulators that are required for a
              variety of critical developmental processes, including organ identity,
              flowering, fruit development, root development, and pattern formation. This
              family of genes has diversified dramatically during the evolution of vascular
              plants, and especially within the angiosperms, resulting in the large number of
              these genes in modern flowering plant species. The problem at hand is to define
              the roles of these MADS-box genes, as well as to understand the evolutionary
              changes that resulted in their great diversity of functions. Cloning and
              sequencing MADS-box genes in a variety of plant species will lay the groundwork
              to address this question. These sequences will be used in a series of
              phylogenetic analyses to determine the relationships among these genes.
              Understanding the diversity of functions encoded by the MADS-box genes, coupled
              with knowledge of how these processes have been modified through the evolution
              of vascular plants, will be key in developing targeted strategies for
              manipulating the growth and development of non-model plant species.
