Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will
              develop low-cost, composites reinforced with carbon nanofibers. Methods
              demonstrated in Phase I will be further developed to generate alignment and
              promote adhesion of nanofibers polymer systems. These efforts help to capture
              the extraordinary intrinsic mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of
              carbon nanofibers in practical, affordable composites. One thrust of the
              program seeks to align nanofiber in extruded and spun flows, in materials that
              include polypropylene, polyester, and nylon. The composite filaments produced
              by these means will then be formed into net-shape composite components for a
              variety of applications. A second thrust focuses on fabrication of nanofiber
              papers for applications that include fuel cell electrodes. Potential end users
              of the technology and leaders in their respective markets, will evaluate
              materials and prototypes produced during Phase II. 

Specific commercial
              applications targeted by the Phase II work include nanofiber reinforced
              polyester and nylon tire cord, thermally conductive plastics for electronics
              packaging, nanofiber paper for fuel cell components, and conductive, high
              service temperature plastics for electrostatic precipitators needed to clean
              exhaust streams from power and chemical production. Each of these applications
              has an associated Phase II partner participating in the program.
