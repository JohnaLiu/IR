Abstract    :
              By and large, biological processes involving ligand binding specificity,
              protein-protein association, protein-membrane association, protonation and
              unprotonation of ionizable groups, and macromolecular conformational changes,
              are given thermodynamically by a reversible work function, the free energy, or
              more generally by its configuration-dependent equivalent.  A quantitative
              determination of free energies is, therefore, a problem of central importance
              in theoretical biophysics.  Computational approaches at different levels of
              complexity and sophistication can be used to try and address this problem.  
              Those range from (relatively expensive) molecular dynamics free energy
              simulations (MD/FES) based on all-atom models in which the solvent is treated
              explicitly to (relative inexpensive) Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) continuum
              electrostatic models in which the influence of the solvent is incorporated
              implicitly.  The goal of this research is to refine and extend current
              computational approaches used in the modeling of biomolecular systems.  More
              particularly, protocols that will provide increased accuracy and reliability in
              estimating free energies while remaining computationally tractable will be
              developed and tested.  Progress in these computational methodologies is
              expected to have a great impact on the rational design of drugs and
              biomolecules.
