Abstract    :
              The Nucleic Acid Database (NDB; http://ndbserver.rutgers.edu/) is a mature
              resource that provides information about crystalline macromolecules that
              contain nucleic acid.  The NDB distributes information about structure through
              the NDB Web site and the ftp server.  There are an NDB Atlas, instructional
              pages and a help desk available.  The NDB began when nucleic acid structural
              biology was most concerned with relatively simple structures.  Today, the NDB
              deals with highly complex molecular assemblies.  The new demands of the science
              and of the user community have led to a proposed improvement in content, query
              capabilities and informatics infrastructure for the NDB.  This will also
              provide better integration with the Protein Database (PDB).
