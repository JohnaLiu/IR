This two-year award for US-Portugal collaboration on
              assessing the impacts of continental emissions from North America and Europe
              upon tropospheric composition in the North Atlantic region involves Richard
              Honrath of Michigan Technological University and Paulo Fialho at the University
              of the Azores, Portugal.  Measurements of ozone, carbon monoxide, black carbon,
              and meteorological parameters will be made at the Pico International
              Atmospheric Chemistry Observatory for a two-year period to test the hypothesis
              that significant formation of ozone occurs in plumes from North America
              advected toward the central North Atlantic.  

The US researchers bring to
              this collaboration expertise in atmospheric chemistry measurements at remote
              field sites in the North Atlantic region and they will provide the measurement
              station infrastructure.  This is complemented by Portuguese expertise in
              atmospheric and land conditions in the Azores region; the Portuguese will
              provide black carbon measurements.   The results of this research are expected
              to contribute to an understanding of anthropogenic impacts on the earth's
              radiation budget, and aid the development of improved estimates of current and
              future impacts on climate.
