Abstract    :
              This grant provides partial travel support for US participants to Plasmodesma
              2001, the fourth international workshop on plasmodesmatal biology, to be held
              in Cape Town, South Africa, August 19-24, 2001. The workshop will bring
              together junior and senior scientists from around the world to discuss many
              aspects of plasmodesmata science, basic and applied. These topics include:
              plasmodesmata structure and
development, virus movement, solute transport,
              symplastic domains and regulation, macromolecular trafficking, and gene
              silencing.
Plasmodesmata research is very active at present and is moving
              quickly on many fronts. The cross-fertilization of ideas that conferences are
              noted for is especially important in this multidisciplinary field, where the
              subject matter and techniques used by one group may be quite foreign to
              another. A total of
approximately thirty speakers will be invited on the basis
              of submitted abstracts.
Others will be encouraged to present posters and short
              talks. The funds from this award will be used to support the travel and per
              diem expenses of US scientists, most of junior rank (graduate students,
              postdoctoral fellows, and assistant professors).
