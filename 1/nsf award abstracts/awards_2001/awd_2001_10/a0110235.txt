Abstract    :
              This biennial conference focuses on the frontiers of science, and some of the
              resulting technology, in the field of thin films of organic materials.  The
              principal themes of this year's conference are Single molecule phenomena, Thin
              film  properties, Self-assembled surfaces, Patterned surfaces, Polyelectrolyte
              surfaces, Electroactive organic materials, Photonic band gap and reflective
              polymers, Colloidal crystals and Biological thin films.  There is a definite
              emphasis on developing and exploiting the ability to build in a rich array of
              functionality and to control inter-particle and inter-surface potentials using
              organic materials.  Advances in the science of thin films or organic materials
              opening up new areas of biomolecular science and biomimetic materials, creating
              new ways of displaying and communication information and developing new routes
              to functional materials.

The structure of the conference will allow
              substantial time for discussion in that approximately 22 speakers have been
              invited, based on a plan to have 5 speakers per day Monday - Thursday, with 2
              speakers in the opening session on Sunday evening.  There will also be a poster
              session, given particular attention during the regular meeting time (currently
              planned for Tuesday morning), so that these important contributions get
              undivided attention early in the week to allow for substantial follow-up.  A
              final novel feature will be a free-form discussion of key research challenges
              in organic thin film research, animated by a group of leaders in the field. 
              There will also be 7 invited discussion leaders, in addition to the chair and
              vice chair, who will stimulate discussion at each of the sessions.  The
              expectation is that at least 25% of the group of 29 invited speakers and
              discussion leaders, will be women or under-represented minorities.
