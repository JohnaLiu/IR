Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
              cost-effective procedure for the production of soluble single-walled carbon
              nanotubes (SWNT) in commercial quantities.  Phase I results demonstrated
              dissolution of full-length SWNTs in common organic solvents by exfoliation and
              covalent functionalization. It has been found that the purity of as-prepared
              SWNT (AP-SWNT) soot greatly influences both the cost and quality of the final
              product.  The major emphasis for the project will be directed towards the
              synthesis of byproduct-free AP-SWNT soot, in purification of the SWNTs and in
              optimizing and scaling-up the dissolution step.

The dissolution of carbon
              nanotubes can greatly enhance the processability of this unique material and
              facilitate the entry of SWNTs into commercial applications requiring high
              strength light weight materials, electromagnetic shielding materials,
              conductive composites and nanoelectronics.  The development of the solution
              chemistry of  SWNTs will facilitate applications in polymer science, and in
              medicine.
