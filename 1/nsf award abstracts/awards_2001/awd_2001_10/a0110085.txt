This award provides partial support for
              participants to 
attend the 2001 Georgia International Topology Conference
              
to be held at the University of Georgia, May 21 through 
June 2, 2001. 
              Since 1961 the University of Georgia has 
organized and hosted a major
              international topology conference
every 8 years.  The 1961, 1969, 1977, 1985,
              and 1993 conferences 
came at times when fundamental new ideas were surfacing
              to set 
the direction of topology for the next few years.  The theme of 
this
              year's conference is primarily on geometric topology with 
special emphasis on
              contact and symplectic topology and related geometries. Further information,
              including invited speakers, 
schedule of talks, housing and travel information
              and application 
is available at http://www.math.uga.edu/~topology/.
