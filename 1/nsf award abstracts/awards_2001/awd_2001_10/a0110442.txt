Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will complete
              the development of a prototype, cost effective high temperature pressure
              sensing device that can be integrated into diesel and turbine engines.  Phase I
              results show that it is feasible to use the proposed novel metal alloy as a
              sensing element in a high temperature pressure transducer.  However, further
              work needs to be performed to optimize the fabrication process of the sensing
              element, improve the design of the transducer, and to establish the
              manufacturing process for future production.  The project will address five
              major aspects of developing a novel, high temperature pressure transducer and
              present a final packaged prototype at the end of the project. These are to
              develop the sensing element fabrication process, develop the manufacturing
              process for a 400 degrees C sensor, fabricate the sensor diaphragm, design and
              fabricate a substrate heater, and to package the sensing element. 

The firm
              has already received significant interest from potential manufacturing and
              commercial partners in the diesel engine and aircraft turbine engine
              industries.
