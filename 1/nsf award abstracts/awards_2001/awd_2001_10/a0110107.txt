The purpose of the research proposed in this project is to
              elucidate mechanisms by which the head of the Drosophila larva is patterned
              during early embryogenesis.  The mechanisms by which the segments of the head
              are specified are not well understood, but are clearly distinct from the
              mechanisms used to specify the segments of the trunk.  The head segments are
              laid down considerably later than the trunk segments in a process independent
              of the pair-rule genes that combinatorially specify the trunk segmentation
              plan.  Furthermore, unlike the trunk segments, segment identity of many of the
              head segments is conferred by non-homeobox containing transcription factors
              whose genes are not members of the HOX complex.

This research will
              specifically examine how the three cephalic segments (intercalary, antennal and
              ocular) are initially established, by examining the controls regulating the
              spatial expression of three segment polarity genes (wg, hh and en) that are
              essential for establishing segmentation in the Drosophila embryo.  In addition,
              this research project will examine the molecular mechanisms by which the
              CNC/Maf-S bZIP transcription factor regulates segment identity in the labral
              and mandibular segments of the head.  

Many of the genes that are involved
              in segmentation of the Drosophila embryo, including those active in head
              segmentation, have homologs in most animal species.  Analysis of the
              developmental roles of these genes in Drosophila head patterning and their
              interrelationships is likely to provide important developmental principles
              involved generally in animal embryology
