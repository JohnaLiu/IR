Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate
              in actual field tests the novel room temperature dewatering process. In the
              Phase I project, Compact Membrane Systems, Inc. (CMS) demonstrated a stable
              osmotic distillation (OD) process on orange juice, grape juice, and coffee.  In
              typical applications, solids levels were increased from approximately 10% sugar
              to approximately 70% sugar. Taste tests showed no significant difference
              between original juice and re-diluted OD product. Process stability was
              demonstrated by  obtaining equivalent product when operating temperature was
              increased to 40C and  maintaining performance after multiple juice dewatering
              and cleaning cycles.  Product stability was demonstrated by leaving OD juice
              concentrate open to air with no microbiological growth due to very low water
              activity in the juice concentrate.  In the OD process the solution to be
              dewatered is placed on one side of the hydrophobic membrane and a high salinity
              feed is placed on the other side. Water vapor then moves from the solution to
              the high salinity side.  While OD has been around for 15 years, no significant
              commercial products have been developed due to these hydrophobic microporous
              membranes rapidly wetting out. This project will demonstrate a novel,
              non-porous perfluoromembrane that eliminates wet-out while maintaining high
              water vapor transport. 

Potential commercial applications include beverages,
              pharmaceuticals, neutraceuticals, and industrial chemicals.
