The components of leaf vascular pattern formation will be
              analyzed, using a molecular genetic approach in Arabidopsis. The formation of
              the leaf vascular pattern has developmental consequences beyond the simple
              siting of veins. Provascular sites in the leaf primordium, where the precursors
              of vein cells are formed, appear to serve as morphogenetic centers that
              regulate the location and specialization of vascular and other leaf cell types.
              This makes functional sense, since many of the cell types must function in
              cooperation with the veins, requiring a defined spatial relationship. Using
              forward and reverse genetic approaches, potential components of this process
              have been identified, including likely members of provascular signaling
              pathways. Their roles will be analyzed and additional candidates will be
              characterized. These are the aims:
1) To identify the immediate signaling
              pathway partners of the VH1 provascular receptor-like kinase, which is a
              candidate for a key role in organizing vascular regions. 
2) To determine the
              role of the cvp1 sterol methyl transferase (SMT2) in provascular cell siting or
              differentiation. These processes are defective in cvp1 mutants. 
3) To
              determine the role of the SAUR gene represented by the thick vein mutant. This
              may represent a direct link between auxin signals and vein formation.
4) To
              characterize the vein patterning roles of additional genes identified by
              mutants with vein pattern defects.
