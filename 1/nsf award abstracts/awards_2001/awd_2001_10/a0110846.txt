Abstract    :
              This research project is being carried out by Professor Jillian Buriak and her
              group in the Department of Chemistry at Purdue University.  With the support of
              the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Buriak is exploring a
              novel method for synthesizing spatially defined functionalized silicon
              surfaces.  Using a scanning probe mediated electrochemical reaction, alkyne
              molecular species are grafted to silicon and germanium surfaces.  This
              localized functionalization of the surface allows direct electronic
              communication between the semiconductor substrate and attached molecular
              electronic devices.  

Using a novel electrografting method, Professor Buriak
              and her colleagues at Purdue University are developing synthetic approaches for
              locally modifying the electronic properties of silicon and germanium
              semiconductor surfaces.  This research is likely to lead to new methods for
              building molecular electronic devices.
