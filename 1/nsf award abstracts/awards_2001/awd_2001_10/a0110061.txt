Abstract    :
              The PI will continue to investigate circulation mechanisms of tropical climate
              variability, using upper-air data sets, in particular the National Center for
              Environmental Prediction (NCEP)-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
              40-year reanalysis, land surface station records and long-term ship
              observations in the tropical oceans. The annual cycle, interannual variability,
              and long-term evolution will be examined. Specific tasks are the following:

              
a) to investigate upper-air mechanisms of the Southern and North Atlantic
              Oscillations;
b) to undertake diagnostic basis for seasonal forecasting of the
              Indian summer monsoon rainfall and boreal autumn rainy season of East Africa by
              examining upper-air processes in the Indian Ocean; 
c) to evaluate equatorial
              zonal circulations using the European Center for Medium Range Weather
              Forecasting and NCEP-NCAR reanalyses datasets; 
d) to develop climate
              prediction techniques for the Indian summer monsoon rainfall and short rains of
              East Africa based on diagnostic methods;
e) to study centers of action, in
              particular the long-term evolution of the North Atlantic Oscillation and
              climate of East Asia, using the NCEP-NCAR data set; and
f) to continue
              synergistic activities including contributions to training courses in Tropical
              Meteorology in the United States.
