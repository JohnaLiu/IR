     The investigators develop methods to carry out
              spatially
explicit control to link natural and anthropogenic forces
              that
influence the demand for biological resources with the dynamics
of those
              resources.  While there have been numerous alternative
approaches taken to add
              spatial components to population models,
few of these have attempted to deal
              with spatial control.  The
investigators evaluate extensions of optimal
              control methods for
dynamical systems to spatial problems, with a focus on
              general
mathematical and computational issues for spatial control linked
with
              abiotic forcing of populations.  The effort is motivated by
two specific
              examples.  The first concerns black bears in the
southern Appalachians, a
              population with explicit environmental
forcing associated with acorn mast
              production, which varies
considerably in time and space.  This interacts with
              hunting,
which is spatially restricted.  The second example involves
              an
invasive exotic plant species, Lygodium microphyllum (Old World
Climbing
              Fern), in the Everglades of South Florida.  This species
can completely cover
              the native tree islands of the region and
spatial control of hydrology may be
              applied to limit its growth.
     Many of the current problems in regional
              management involve
issues of spatial control -- what to do, where to do it and
              for
what time periods.  Examples include alternative plans for land
use,
              forest harvesting, location of dams, and water control.  A
wide variety of the
              major environmental public policy issues in
the US require scientific
              assessments of the impacts of
alternative management.  The investigators
              develop new
mathematical and computational approaches that can aid
              managers
and the public to compare alternative management plans of land
and
              regional resources.  The objective also is to allow for
comparisons of
              alternative criteria, arising from different
stakeholders, to judge the public
              utility of different spatial
management plans.  The project is supported by
              the Applied
Mathematics, Computational Mathematics, and Population
              Biology
programs and by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.
