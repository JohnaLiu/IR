Abstract    :
              Polyphosphate (polyP) is a ubiquitous polymer found in all cells from archaea,
              eubacteria, fungi, and protozoa to plants and mammals.  PolyP is comprised of a
              linear chain of hundreds of phosphate residues linked by ATP-like, high-energy,
              phosphoanhydride metaphosphate) bonds.  Several biological functions have been
              suggested for polyP, including a reservoir for phosphate and energy, a chelator
              of metal ions, a buffer against alkali, and a channel for DNA entry.  PolyP
              also appears to have a role in two-component signal transduction, yet, its
              biological role is poorly understood.  Complementary molecular genetic and
              physiology experiments will be carried out in the bacterium Escherichia coli
              with the goal of better understanding the function of polyP in cell biology. 
              Experiments are being directed towards addressing two aims: the first is to
              define the genetic regulation of the polyP kinase (ppk)-polyP phosphatase (ppx)
              operon, and the second is to examine the consequences of rapidly increasing
              polyP levels on gene regulation in vivo.
