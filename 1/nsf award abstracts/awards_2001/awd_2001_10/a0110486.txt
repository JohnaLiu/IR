Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will further
              develop a revolutionary approach to nanostructure fabrication. This Near-Field
              Scanning Optical Nanolithographic approach, which we have already shown to be
              capable of writing 100nm width lines, utilizes a direct, optical write
              technology in conjunction with optical photoresists. The direct optical writing
              is performed with a customized Near-Field Scanning Optical Microscope (NSOM)
              tool.  The major goal of the proposed work is to design and construct a
              commercially viable NSOM lithography tool and demonstrate processes for
              flexible pattern generation on 4" wafers. Phase I work demonstrated the
              preliminary design of the NSOM lithography tool and photoresist processes using
              a novel inorganic hydrogenated amorphous silicon resist, as well as
              conventional polymer resists.  Best line widths of approximately 100nm,
              comparable to the probe diameter, were
obtained.

The commercial benefits
              from this project will be the construction and demonstration of the NSOM
              lithography tool for rapid prototyping of nanostructures in university and
              corporate research labs.
