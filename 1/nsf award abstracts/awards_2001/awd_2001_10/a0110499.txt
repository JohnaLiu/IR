Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project continues the
              development of the spinning performance of melt spun fibers containing
              microencapsulated phase change materials (microPCMs). In Phase I, polypropylene
              fibers less then 3 denier per filament were demonstrated with a good balance of
              physical properties (tenacity, percent breaking elongation, modulus, etc.) and
              thermal energy storage capability (latent heat content). Phase II will focus on
              process and materials variables that affect, in particular, the structure and
              properties of the as-spun fiber, and in general, the overall spinning process. 
              A key objective is to convert the microcapsule wet cake into a well-dispersed
              microPCM/polymer concentrate devoid of volatilizing components for adding to
              virgin polymer and extruding into fiber. Innovative spinning concepts will be
              employed to improve the capture of microPCMs to maximize thermal energy storage
              properties. 

The commercial availability of melt spun fibers and resulting
              fabrics with enhanced thermal energy storage capabilities will enable products
              with superior performance for use in situations where comfort, endurance, or
              survivability in cold or hot environments is demanded. Thus, the perfection of
              this technology for the production of good quality fabric could be a major
              breakthrough in the textile industry.
