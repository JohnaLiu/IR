Description: This award is for support of a cooperative
              project by Professor Bimal K. Paul, Department of Geography, Kansas State
              University, Manhattan, Kansas and Professor Shahanaz Huq-Hussain, Department of
              Geography and Environment, University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh.  The two
              plan to address the problem of arsenic poisoning due to contaminated tubewell
              water and the way villagers in Bangladesh respond to the incidence of poisoning
              and how they seek health services.  The research is to provide information
              about how arsenic patients perceive their illness, how they respond in terms of
              health care utilization, and what determines their health-seeking behavior. 
              The information is intended to improve treatment compliance and offer valuable
              insights for future action plans to combat the arsenic problem in Bangladesh in
              a timely manner.

Scope:  In this project the collaborators plan to combine
              their expertise in analytical and field studies, including field surveys and
              interviews, participation observation, and focus group discussions to collect
              primary data for this research.  They will employ qualified graduate students
              from Bangladesh to conduct the field interviews.  One graduate student from
              Kansas State University will work with Dr. Paul using qualitative and
              quantitative approaches to analyze field data.  The results will be
              disseminated as early as possible to help policy makers and others engaged in
              dealing with the arsenic problem in Bangladesh.   This project is supported by
              the Division of International Programs and the Division of Behavioral and
              Cognitive Sciences.
