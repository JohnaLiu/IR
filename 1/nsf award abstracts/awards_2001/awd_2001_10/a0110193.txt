Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on
              olefin/paraffin separations.  In the USA, ethylene and propylene are produced
              in larger quantities than any other organic chemical. Currently,
              olefin/paraffin separation is done by distillation, an extremely
              energy-intensive process because of their low relative volatility. 
              Selectivities of polymeric membranes are inadequate for these separations, but
              selectivities of facilitated transport membranes are higher.  However, membrane
              instability, low gas fluxes, and a required water-saturated feed limit their
              industrial application. To overcome these problems a new type of facilitated
              transport membrane is being developed.  The membrane has high gas fluxes,
              dramatically improved olefin/paraffin selectivities over conventional
              facilitated transport membranes, operates with a dry feed, and is stable for
              several weeks. 

The commercial applications from this project will be
              membranes that will significantly lower cost and energy consumption of
              industrial olefin/paraffin separations.  Other applications include by
              product/vent gas streams in polyethylene/polypropylene, cumene, isopropanol and
              acrylonitrile plants.  Subsequent applications are propylene recovery from FCCU
              off-gas and from large processes (propane dehydrogenation and steam
              crackers).
