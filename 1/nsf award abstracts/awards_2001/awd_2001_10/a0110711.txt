Abstract    :
              
   Steroid hormones can have rapid effects on nerve cells in the brain, and
              are known to interact with binding sites in the brain.  While peripheral
              endocrine organs supply many steroids, it is now known that brain tissue itself
              can synthesize some steroids.  Glial cells can convert cholesterol to other
              compounds, including the steroid dehydro-epiandrostenone (DHEA), one of the
              main neuroactive steroids synthesized in the brain.  In peripheral tissues a
              protein enzyme known as P450c17 is responsible for DHEA formation, but this
              enzymatic activity has not been found in the brain.  This paradox led to
              controversy over the role of this enzyme in brain DHEA formation, and whether
              regulation of neurosteroid biosynthesis occurs via a brain-specific steroid
              biosynthetic pathway.  To help settle this debate, this project develops a
              genetic model of a mouse with the P450c17 gene knocked out.  The expression and
              activity of steroidogenic enzymes in the brain cells of these mice are examined
              to investigate the expression of a possible novel alternative pathway for DHEA
              synthesis.
    Results will be important to resolving a current controversy in
              neuroendocrinology.  The impact will extend beyond neuroendocrinology by
              leading to a better understanding of the neurochemical pathways underlying
              brain function in general, and so will be important for neurochemistry,
              developmental neuroscience, and the biopsychology of stress and aging.  The
              project also supports postdoctoral training.
