Abstract    :
              There are thousands of genes in the human genome.  What forces have shaped the
              evolution of these genes?  Recent research has suggested that the most rapidly
              evolving genes in many organisms may be driven by the intense competition and
              conflict that surrounds sexual reproduction.  For example, females in many
              species will mate with more than one male in succession, which means that the
              sperm of different males must compete to fertilize eggs.  Sperm competition is
              thought to result in an escalating, "three-way tug-of-war" as evolutionary
              conflicts are played out between the genes affecting sperm offensive abilities,
              sperm defensive abilities, and female control of sperm usage.  This perpetual
              conflict surrounding fertilization success has been hypothesized to drive rapid
              and sustained evolutionary change, analogous to an escalating arms race.

The
              research outlined in this proposal is designed to test the relative importance
              of male-male versus male-female conflict for the evolution of genes related to
              fertilization success in nematodes of the genus Caenorhabditis.  In these
              species, it is possible to compare the way genes are evolving between lineages
              that have very different sperm competition regimes but are otherwise extremely
              similar to each other.  Using standard techniques in molecular biology, the
              rates and patterns of protein evolution will be studied for two genes involved
              in fertilization success in these organisms.
