The Hot Springs Village site, located on the Alaska
              Peninsula, was excavated in the 1970s and 1980s by Professors Hiroaki and
              Atsuko Okada.  The Okadas produced preliminary reports of the excavations, but
              were unable to complete the final analysis.  Now contemporary archaeologists
              will assist the Okadas with the final analysis and transport the artifacts and
              other materials back to Alaska for curation at the Museum of the Aleutians.
