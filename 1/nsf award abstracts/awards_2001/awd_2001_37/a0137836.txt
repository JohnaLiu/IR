Abstract    :
              Animals interact with their local environment in ways that determine their
              reproductive success and survival.  By looking at how climate, topography, and
              vegetation interact with the physical properties of the animal, including its
              metabolic rate and heat gain and loss, a basic model can be developed.  The
              current model uses global climate data, digital elevation maps, vegetation maps
              and animal properties to calculate available microclimates, animal energetics,
              behavior, activity patterns, food web structure, community structure and
              potential for and food-borne pathogen and pesticide exposure. New work will
              extend the model's availability by providing a graphical user interface and web
              accessibility, as well as by extending the database of information on animal
              reflectivity and morphology.

The model can be applied to a wide range of
              questions from the appropriateness of environments for relocating endangered
              species to the impact of climate change on animal population dynamics and
              environmental impacts of pesticide spraying or forest burns or other management
              activities.  Informed decision making is improved and a wide range of
              collaborators and students help to spread the use of the
