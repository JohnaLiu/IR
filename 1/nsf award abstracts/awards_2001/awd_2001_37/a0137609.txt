Abstract    :
              Ants, spiders, and lobsters (arthropods) are built from repeated parts called
              body segments. Typically each segment has one pair of limbs and these limbs
              define the lifestyles of different arthropods: they can be used for walking,
              swimming, feeding, etc. Comparisons of animals as different as crabs and flies,
              show that segments and limbs can be very differently specialized in different
              arthropod groups. However, it is still unknown whether segments can evolve such
              specializations independently. Are segments along the body axis free to evolve
              on their own or do evolutionary specializations of one segment cause
              neighboring segments to change? This question will be tested in selected groups
              of crustaceans by comparing changes to limb and segment structure in closely
              related species. From these data, the evolutionary pattern of segment evolution
              can be reconstructed to determine the degree to which segments can evolve
              independently. This evolutionary analysis will be coupled to a series of
              experiments on crustacean embryos to evaluate how evolutionary patterns of
              segmentation are linked to mechanisms that generate segments during
              development.

	The major groups of animals are distinct in the ways their
              bodies are built, that is, they show distinct body plans. Understanding how
              body plans are organized provides a tool for interpreting how they evolve. This
              works addresses a fundamental question about the evolution of arthropod body
              plans: do arthropods have a modular design? This work will then explicitly link
              the modularity shown in evolution to modularity in development.
