Abstract    :
              In February 1999 long-term monitoring of Mid-Atlantic Ridge Seismicity was begun
              between 15 and 35 degrees north using autonomous hydrophones moored within the
              SOFAR channel.  The goal is to obtain a first-order understanding of the
              spatial and temporal patterns in overall seismicity, and the partitioning
              between magmatic and tectonic events at this slow-spreading ridge.  The current
              grant extends the deployment of the current hydropone array for an additional
              four years, and makes the information more widely available to the ocean
              science community.
