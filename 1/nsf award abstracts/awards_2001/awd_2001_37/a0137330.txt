Abstract    :
              0137330  Alleman  Wastewater nitrification is considered to be a highly
              sensitive biological process given the metabolic nature of the involved
              bacteria (e.g., low growth rate, etc.) and correspondingly low cell population.
               Furthermore, the daily loss of these nitrifiers within a reactor's necessary
              waste sludge stream creates a pragmatic limitation on the permissible amount of
              nitrifiers that can be maintained.  This proposed research focuses on an
              innovative means to beneficially increase the population of nitrifiers beyond
              that of conventional systems by selectively detaching and recovering these
              valuable nitrifiers from the waste sludge such that they can then be recycled
              back into use.  As compared to heterotrophic cells whose chemical-based
              attachment (via an adhesive exocellular polymer) and flocculation behavior does
              not afford this flexibility, we believe that attached nitrifying cells can be
              prompted to detach and deflocculate within a suitably motivating environment. 
              The underlying mechanism would subsequently be that of a controlled chemical,
              physical, and/or electrical effect which induces attached nitrifying cells
              contained within the waste sludge to detach and deflocculate, at which point
              these discrete nitrifiers can then be separated from the remaining waste sludge
              for subsequent reuse.  As such, this capability would then facilitate a means
              of controlling (and beneficially raising) the nitrifier solids retention time
              (SRT) in a fashion that is independent from that of the remaining mixed-culture
              SRT. ***
