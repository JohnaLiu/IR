Abstract    :
              
This ADVANCE Fellows project studies social and spatial change in residential
              and family patterns that occurred in Charleston, S.C., during the 20th century,
              with a particular focus on segregation patterns from the city's historic
              preservation movement.    The main research questions to be addressed by this
              project involve the relationship between racial and economic segregation and
              the individual-level patterns of residential mobility resulting from changes in
              the urban environment.  

This project will combine historical census records
              with City Directories to follow a sample of residents from 1900 to 1960. 
              Patterns of spatial and social change will be mapped, overlaying ecological
              change and political change in the context of historic preservation.  This will
              provide an overview of economic and residential segregation patterns.  One of
              the main innovations of this study is that it will match individuals across
              multiple time periods.  In addition, the study will combine traditional
              sociological perspectives with recent developments in spatial analysis.

This
              award is supported through the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the
              ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and
