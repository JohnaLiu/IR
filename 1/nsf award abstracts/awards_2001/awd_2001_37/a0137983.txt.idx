Abstract    :
               Proposal: EAR-0137983 PI: Jordan Title: Moving EarthScope Forward: A Series
              of Workshops for Science and Coordination  This grant is intended to support
              a series of workshops that will help to prepare for the construction and
              coordination of the EarthScope facility, which is a proposal to NSF's Major
              Research Equipment account.  EarthScope is a bold interdisciplinary initiative
              developed by a broad segment of the Earth Science community to apply modern
              observational, analytical and telecommunications technologies to investigate
              the structure and evolution of the North American Continent, and the active
              tectonic processes that shape our land.  It will contribute to the mitigation
              of risks from geological hazards - including earthquakes and volcanoes, the
              development of natural resources, and the public's understanding of the dynamic
              Earth.  Workshops supported by this grant will focus the science, advance
              coordination among the EarthScope components, and communicate the essence of
              the initiative to the full scientific community, other federal agencies, state
              geologists, local officials, and the general public.
