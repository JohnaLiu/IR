Abstract    :
              This award supports a major revision of the Core Plus Mathematics Project (CPMP;
              marketed as Contemporary Mathematics in Context) student materials for high
              school mathematics, the development of more informative teacher materials, and
              the development of materials for parents and other community stakeholders in
              mathematics education.  The revision of student and teacher materials will be
              based on studies of student achievement conducted over eight years; a large
              collection of suggestions from teachers who have used the materials in their
              classrooms; results from expert panels, including the U.S. Department of
              Education, the American Association for the Advancement of Science;
              recommendations in the Principals and Standards for School Mathematics and a
              special review by university mathematicians sponsored by the developers.  The
              development is done by a team that includes teachers, mathematics education
              specialists, mathematicians and statisticians.
