Abstract    :
              Summary:  This project will obtain isotopic and trace metal analyses on planktic
              and benthic foraminifers to test initial results from subpolar North Atlantic
              cores suggesting that global ice volume during MIS 11 was similar to modern ice
              volume and that sea level during MIS 11 was not substantially higher than
              today.  The project will measure oxygen isotope ratios on planktic and benthic
              foraminifers at three sites in the tropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to
              compare these values against new and existing data from subpolar North Atlantic
              cores.  In addition Mg/Ca ratios of  benthic and planktic foraminifers in
              selected intervals will be measured as independent estimate of temperature
              effects.  The new analyses will provide a means for separating temperature and
              salinity effects from ice volume effects on the isotope values.  Cd/Ca and
              carbon isotope measurements of benthic foraminifers will be used to detect deep
              circulation changes associated with the glacial - interglacial transitions.
