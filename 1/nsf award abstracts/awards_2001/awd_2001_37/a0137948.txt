Funds are provided to support the registration fees of the
              applicants and finalists of the young investigator competition in the
              conference Computers in Cardiology, Memphis Cook Convention Center, Memphis,
              Tennessee, September 22-25, 2002.
  
A series of conferences on computers in
              cardiology was established 28 years ago in recognition of the import role that
              computer technology would play in cardiovascular research and in clinical
              patient care. The conferences also facilitate important productive
              communication between engineers and clinicians that stimulates relevant
              research and development. Participants have found the meetings to be
              particularly helpful because of the manageable size, and the commonality of
              interests of attendees that fosters interpersonal interaction outside the
              formal sessions. Computers in Cardiology has proven to be a major world forum
              for presentation of new research over a wide spectrum of computer applications
              in cardiology. The conference serves as the prime site for gestation and early
              nourishment of a number of fundamental technologies that have led to major
              improvements in the practice of cardiology. 

The results from this award are
              expected to have broad impacts through the published Proceedings, which are to
              be produced by the IEEE press, with copies distributed to the attendees and
              some 300 libraries. Of special significance is the fostering of
              interdisciplinary research between researchers in different fields including
              medicine, physics, engineering, and computer science.
