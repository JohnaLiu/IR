              ABSTRACT

OCE-0137207


In this study, researchers at the University of
              California at Irvine will make high-precision measurements of radiocarbon (14C)
              in annual bands in corals from the Galapagos Islands in order to understand the
              variability of carbon dioxide fluxes from the tropical Pacific Ocean to the
              atmosphere between AD 1600 and 1950.  The radiocarbon measurements will be made
              by accelerator mass spectrometry.  Measurements of the strontium/calcium ratio
              and the oxygen isotopic composition (18O) will be made to identify changes in
              coralline 14C arising from upwelling-induced changes in sea surface
              temperature.  The investigators expect that this study will yield a record of
              how the CO2 cycle in the tropical Pacific has changed on human time scales.
