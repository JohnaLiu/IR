Abstract    :
              Funds are provided to upgrade gas chromatograph facilities at Brown University
              that will allow high-resolution studies at Uk-37 and other organic
              paleoenvironmental proxies and biomarkers.  The new configuration will allow
              through put of 110-125 samples, instead of the present 40-50 analyses.  The
              University will cost share 30% of the total request.  The new will result in
              improved productivity for the PI and other investigators at Brown engaged in
              serveral marine geological projects.
