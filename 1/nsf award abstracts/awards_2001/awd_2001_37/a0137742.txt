Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for the PI to study life history evolution in marine
              systems by combining biogeographical, biochemical, morphological and
              paleontological approaches to examining egg size evolution in a family of
              marine bivalves relative to a major biogeographic event, the rise of the
              Central American Isthmus (CAI) at 2.8-3.1 million years ago. The rise of the
              CAI separated the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and isolated populations of
              previously-continuous species (known as geminate species pairs). The presence
              of multiple closely-related species offers a unique, replicated natural
              experiment that can shed light on evolutionary forces. The PI will study the
              egg size evolution of bivalves in the family Arcidae to determine the rate and
              timing of the evolution relative to the rise of the CIA. This research will
              provide the first descriptive data on egg size in the past, and will add a new
              approach for exploration of oceanic change and evolutionary response to
              geologic events. In addition, funding will support research experience for five
              undergraduate students.
