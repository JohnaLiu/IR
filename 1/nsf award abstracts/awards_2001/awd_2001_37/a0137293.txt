Abstract    :
              Lithospheric bending may give a fundamentally different window into the
              processes of fault initiation and development than does lithospheric stretching
              .  The investigators will take advantage of this window by a systematic
              analysis of bathymetric data and sidescan sonar images for all trenches where
              data is available.  Trenches offer a unique way to relate falut characteristics
              to the amount of strain required to develop a system of faults. 
              Two-dimensional numerical models will be used to relate lithospheric properties
              to the observed spacing of faults and the amplitude of their offset.
