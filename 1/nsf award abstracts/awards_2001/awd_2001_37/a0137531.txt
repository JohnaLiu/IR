Abstract

Ectomycorrhizae are symbioses between many important forest trees
              such as Douglas-fir and so called ectomycorrhizal fungi. The symbiosis is
              mutually beneficial to both partners, and neither can survive without the
              other. The trees provide carbohydrates to the fungi while the fungi facilitate
              nutrient uptake for the trees. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are taxonomically much
              more diverse than their tree hosts, but it remains largely unclear whether the
              different species of fungi differ in the functions they fulfill for the tree
              hosts and the forest ecosystem or whether they are "functionally redundant". In
              addition to trees and fungi, bacteria have also been shown to live in close
              association with ectomycorrhizae, but have rarely been investigated, and it
              remains unclear whether and how they affect the functioning of the symbiosis.
              As a first step in assessing the potential influence of bacterial populations
              on the functional diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi, the author of this
              proposal will study how bacterial diversity is structured between different
              species of fungi and different individuals within a species. Methods will be
              developed to measure the genetic diversity of bacteria directly from
              mycorrhizae thus avoiding the bias introduced by bacterial cultivation in the
              laboratory. 
By incorporating bacteria into the functional equation, this
              research will take the science of ectomycorrhizal ecology into a whole new
              direction.
