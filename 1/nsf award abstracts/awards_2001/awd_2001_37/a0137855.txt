Abstract    :
              Two high-school algebra modules will be developed consistent with current
              research on student learning.  Each module will span from four to six weeks of
              classroom instruction; incorporate the use of technology; and include a
              curriculum unit, teacher guide, assessment materials and materials to support
              community-based mathematics literacy events.  One module will use the "Road
              Coloring Problem" to introduce students to functions and lay the groundwork for
              matrix multiplication.  The other module will use games to enhance students'
              mathematical understanding, and will help students learn polynomials and
              introduce elementary counting and probability concepts.  The materials will
              embody a pedagogical approach whereby mathematics emerges from students'
              careful observation and systematic analysis of familiar events that are
              mathematically rich.  Teachers using the materials will form professional
              communities by collaborating online.  The materials will be pilot- and
              field-tested in several geographically and demographically diverse sites.  The
              project will have formative and summative evaluation components.
