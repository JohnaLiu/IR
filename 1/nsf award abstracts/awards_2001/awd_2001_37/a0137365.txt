Abstract    :
              Metalliferous clays and Mn nodules and crusts contain highly radiogenic Hf
              isotopes and if subducted, the Hf isotopes could be used as a tracer for their
              presence in arc lavas. The purpose of this proposed study is to analyze Hf and
              Nd isotopes in marine sediments from outboard 12 subduction systems to
              determine how prevalent this signature might be. The origin of this unusual Hf
              isotopic fractionation is also uncertain, and these new data will help to
              constrain its cause. Finally, the new data will be helpful for constraining the
              terrestrial mass balance of Hf and Nd isotopic systems. The samples will mostly
              be ODP-drilled sediments obtained from arcs with potentially high variations of
              Hf isotopes and systems with very high sediment flux.
