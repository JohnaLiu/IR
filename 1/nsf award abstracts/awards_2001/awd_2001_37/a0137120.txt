Abstract    :
              This grant will fund a conference on important measurement issues in the
              economy. As the new economy has developed, intangible assets and
              high-technology investments have played an increasingly important role in the
              economy. Important measurement issues have emerged such as how to measure
              intangible assets, and whether we are measuring high-technology capital
              accurately. The conference, being co-sponsored by the Conference on Research on
              Income and Wealth of the National Bureau of Economic Research Inc., will be
              held in April 2002. Topics to be addressed at the conference include: Financial
              markets and the valuation of intangible assets, the role of human capital and
              human resource practices in measuring and understanding intangibles, and the
              relationship between R&D and the measurement of intangible assets. The goal of
              the conference is to promote better measurement of capital, which would improve
              assessments of the economy's long-run rate of growth, the pace of technological
              change, and of the nation's wealth.
