Abstract    :
              This study will produce a phylogeny (family tree) of the 38 flea beetle
              
supra-generic groups and 5 galerucine tribes, which will test three 
              
proposed  hypotheses of relationships, between the flea beetles and the
              
galerucinae using a comprehensive taxon set and an exhaustive character set
              
from adult and larval morphology and 3 gene fragments from the
              
mitochondrial, nuclear and ribosomal genomes. This phylogeny will also be
              
used to test hypotheses of evolution of jumping behavior, evolution of host-
              
plant choice, Biogeography and geologic age of the flea beetles, and
              
evolution of larval leaf feeding which are of general scientific
              interest.

The flea beetles (Chrysomelidae: Alticinae) together with their
              sister 
group, the Galerucinae, are a huge group containing over 12,000
              species; 
they are also extremely damaging to agriculture. The flea beetles
              are 
renowned for making  "shot holes" in table crops such as potato, broccoli
              and 
grapes. The galerucines are infamous for the multi-billion dollar damage
              to 
corn and beans.  Unfortunately, the taxonomic status of the flea beetles
              is 
so confusing that it impedes proper research and pest management.  Over
              500 
described genera of flea beetles are divided into 38 supra-generic
              tribes, 
sub-tribes and sections and there is no taxonomic or phylogenetic
              hypothesis 
of how these tribes and series are related to one another. This
              lack of a 
trust -worthy phylogeny is especially important to pest management,
              where 
assumptions about pesticide applications or search for biological
              control 
agents are often made based on taxonomic position and where money is
              often 
wasted if these assumptions are incorrect.
