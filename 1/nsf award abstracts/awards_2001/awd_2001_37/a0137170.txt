Abstract    :
              	This research investigates the inter-relationships between dual careers and
              long distance family migration from 1970 to 2000.   The increase in families
              with two careers both encourages  family migration (because two people are
              exposed to career opportunities) and discourages migration (because of the
              constraints on the spouse when one partner has an opportunity).  Research with
              the Current Population Survey will investigate to what extent changes in
              overall family mobility can be explained by the growth in dual career families.
                Other analyses with the Panel Study of Income Dynamics will estimate how
              characteristics of the spouses' occupations and of the local labor market
              influence family migration decisions.   Those analyses will be extended to
              investigate gender differences in the consequences of family migration (or lack
              of migration).  It is generally believed that women's careers benefit least
              from family migration, but that may be changing as couples make migration
              decisions to accommodate both careers.
