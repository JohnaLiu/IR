The Impact
              Project will identify and document research contributions that have had
              substantial impact, determine the research modalities that have been
              successful, identify technology transition approaches that have worked best,
              and anticipate directions that software engineering research might most
              effectively pursue, based on its history and positioning.  Funding will support
              travel costs for a series of meetings to plan, discuss, and execute the
              studies.  As a special initiative partially funded by the ACM Special Interest
              Group in Software Engineering (SIGSOFT), the project seeks to be highly
              inclusive, involving a large number of members of the software engineering
              community, as well as others whose interests overlap with software engineering.
               The project's outputs will be a series of documents and briefings, including
              scholarly,  reports.  Project results should be useful to the software
              engineering research and practitioner communities, to other academic
              disciplines, to government funding agencies, and to the public by helping
              objectively assess the software engineering community's record of
              achievement.
