Abstract    :
              The Investigators will conduct an integrated spatial analysis of committee
              markup voting and floor roll call voting in the United States House of
              Representatives and Senate.  They have collected a comprehensive data set of
              markups staring in September, 1999 and will add to this during the project. All
              data will be web published and integrated into the VOTEVIEW software for
              congressional roll calls. 
The Investigators will incorporate methodological
              developments integrating the small committee methods developed by Londregan
              with the large legislature methods developed by Poole and Rosenthal and others.
              
The analysis tests a number of theoretical hypotheses that concern the
              dimensionality of floor vs. committee voting.  For example, are committees
              drawn, like the floor, mainly on liberal-conservative lines or are they more
              complex?  The Investigators will also test the extent to which committees are
              preference outliers.  Are certain interests over represented on committees?
