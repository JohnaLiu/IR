Abstract    :
              Using assessment as the entry point, the Mathematics Assessment Resources
              Service (MARS) group at Michigan State University, University of
              California-Berkeley and the Shell Center at the University of Nottingham will
              create a set of assessment-related "tools" for educators engaged in reforming
              mathematics education in K-12 schools.  Using a process of "co-development"
              with participating client systems (e.g., New York City, Clark County,
              Pittsburgh, El Paso, El Centro, Rhode Island) the project will create a set of
              specific tools that address critical issues such as how to use assessment
              information productively, designing effective professional development support
              around assessment and communicating effectively with parents about data and
              testing.  The process of tool identification and development has been
              pilot-tested through a prior grant.
