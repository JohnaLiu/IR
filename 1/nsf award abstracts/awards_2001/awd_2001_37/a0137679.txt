Abstract    :
              The PI will conduct a geochemical study of existing samples from the Galapagos
              Islands and dredged samples for the Galapagos archipelago in order to sort out
              the various mantle components that apparently contribute to mantle melts there.
              He will primarily analyze olivine and spinel-hosted melt inclusions, based on
              evidence that such inclusions generally contain more diverse melts and are less
              affected by mixing than bulk lavas. He will analyze major elements, trace
              elements, volatile abundances, Pb isotopes and Oxygen isotopes in order to
              determine the nature of various mantle endmembers, and to provide constraints
              on what these endmembers actually are (subducted sediment? recycled oceanic
              gabbro? Recycled altered basalt, etc..). The study will mostly be conducted
              using instruments at WHOI, DTM, and Caltech.
