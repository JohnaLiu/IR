Abstract    :
              The ALOMAR Weber sodium lidar is a newly completed, state-of-the-art instrument
              built and installed at the Arctic Lidar Observatory for Middle Atmosphere
              Research (ALOMAR) in northern Norway (69.3 degrees N) with Air Force funding
              under the Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP).  Its
              capabilities for dual-beam temperature, wind, and momentum flux measurements
              have recently been demonstrated under continuing Air Force support.  This is an
              NSF-funded collaborative project for a comprehensive study of the dynamics,
              structure, and variability of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) using
              the Weber lidar and associated instrumentation at ALOMAR.  Such funding of
              Weber lidar dynamics studies is expected to enhance dramatically measurement
              and research activities and the potential of U.S. PIs to participate in various
              collaborative programs, including ground-based support and correlative science
              with the thermosphere ionosphere mesosphere energetics and dynamics (TIMED)
              satellite and the MaCWAVE rocket dynamics studies, of considerable relevance to
              the NSF Aeronomy Program objectives.  This award will also make ALOMAR
              facilities and correlative research opportunities available to other U.S.
              scientists.
