Abstract    :
              
This ADVANCE Fellows award supports an anthropologist who is researching how
              patients' access to medical knowledge on the internet is reshaping
              doctor-patient relationships.  The PI will compile 100 illness case studies
              consisting of interviews, questionnaires, and recordings of doctor-patient
              interactions over the course of each patient's treatment.  With carefully
              structured comparisons, the research will discuss the internet's impact on
              people's medical lives and relationships, comment on any correlation between
              access to medical knowledge and social inequities in health, and test models of
              anthropological theory on the relationships between anxiety and the pursuit of
              knowledge on the one hand, authority and the distribution of knowledge on the
              other, and the overarching relationship between the two, that is between person
              and society.  The PI will also engage in a number of educational and outreach
              activities including giving talks on doctor-patient relationships and cultural
              sensitivity.
