Abstract    :
              Cellular cholesterol metabolism is a complex problem and in spite of tremendous
              progress remains incompletely understood. A great deal is known about the
              enzymes that synthesize cholesterol and about the
processes that are involved
              in the uptake of cholesterol from the diet and how it is transported through
              the blood to be delivered to cells.  The question of how cholesterol moves
              around within the cell however,
remains largely unknown. The goal of this
              research is to determine if a protein called caveolin-1 is involved in this
              process. These studies are possible because the movements of caveolin within
              live cells can be
monitored using a fluorescent tracer protein attached to the
              normal protein. Caveolin binds cholesterol and is known to travel within the
              cell to compartments where cholesterol is synthesized, used and stored.  When
              completed these studies will determine the role of caveolin in cholesterol
              homeostasis.

Cells absolutely require cholesterol to survive and strive to
              maintain the level of intracellular cholesterol within tightly controlled
              parameters. Humans can either obtain their cholesterol from the diet or they
              can synthesize it de novo. Defects in the pathways that regulate the level of
              cholesterol have important consequences and contribute to many human diseases.
              It is necessary to determine what proteins are
required for these
              intracellular cholesterol movements in order to understand how defects result
              in disease.
