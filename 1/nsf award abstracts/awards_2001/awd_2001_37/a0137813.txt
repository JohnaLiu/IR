Abstract    :
              As interest grows in deciphering the factors that influence the Earth's climate,
              researchers have developed several proxies useful for reconstructing ancient
              environmental conditions.  One of the most promising tools for reconstructing
              short-term (seasonal to annual) environmental fluctuations is isotopic analysis
              of vertebrate fossils.  Analyses of fossil bison hold particular promise for
              such research.  However, the precision of paleoenvironmental reconstructions
              based on analyses of fossil bison is currently limited because: (1) the rate of
              enamel biomineralization within bison teeth has not been studied in detail, and
              (2) the precise relationship between the d18O and d13C values of modern bison
              and local environmental conditions has not been precisely quantified.  
	The
              purpose of this project is to quantify how precisely isotopic analyses of bison
              can be used to reconstruct paleoenvionemtal conditions.  The first part of this
              study will document the patterns of biomineralization and isotope variations
              preserved within bison tooth enamel in order to develop an optimal sampling
              strategy.  The second part of this study will quantify how well the d18O and
              d13C values of modern Great Plains bison correlate with environmental changes
              including: average temperature, seasonal temperature range, precipitation,
              relative humidity, and grassland composition (i.e., C3/C4 ratio).  This study
              will thus quantify how precisely analyses of the d18O and d13C values of bison
              can be used to reconstruct annual and seaonal variations in local environments.
               It will produce a map of the isotope gradients in modern bison, which will
              serve as a baseline for interpreting the isotope signals preserved in fossil
              bison as well as other herbivores.  This study will thus greatly increase the
              precision and accuracy of paleoclimatic and paleovegetation reconstruction
              based on isotope analyses of fossil herbivores.
