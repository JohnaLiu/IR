Abstract    :
              The Education Development Center is continuing the work of the K-12 Mathematics
              Curriculum Center.  The Center continues to offer seminars designed to build
              capacity in the field.  In particular, this work will assist mathematics
              coordinators, lead teachers and staff developers design professional
              development programs that support teachers using Standards-based materials;
              help districts consider the alignment between their new  curriculum, classroom
              assessment and high-stakes tests; and help school districts develop plans for
              collecting and analyzing data and reporting results in order to evaluate the
              impact of their curriculum implementation.  The Center will draw upon its
              experience with delivering seminars to districts in the past to develop on-line
              courses as a way of extending the services of the center to a wider audience. 
              Another strong focus of the Center is to support the work of other mathematics
              implementation projects by developing materials and other products of use to
              these projects, by studying successful approaches and barriers to
              implementation and by facilitating communications among these projects
