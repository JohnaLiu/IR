PI:		Gronwall, Caryl

Dr. Gronwall is awarded funds
              at Pennsylvania State University to carry out a multi-wavelength study of the
              star formation history of the universe.  She will use optical, infrared, and
              ultraviolet observations of large samples of emission-line galaxies to measure
              the density of the star formation rate at different look-back times. Dr.
              Gronwall will use data obtained from many sources, including the Hobby-Eberly
              Telescope, the Advanced Camera for Suveys on the Hubble Space Telescope, and
              the Space Infrared Telescope Facility.  The observational results will be
              incorporated into Dr. Gronwall's models of the evolution of galaxies over
              time.
