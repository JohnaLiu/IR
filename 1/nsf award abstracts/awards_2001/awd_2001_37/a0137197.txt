This project seeks to understand how coastally trapped waves
              (CTWs) interact with baroclinic currents and topography (canyons and ridges). 
              Potential regimes where such interactions may be important are the Great
              Australian Bight and the Black Sea.  Motivated by recent model results that
              suggest that a barotropic shelf wave in a retrograde current can generate
              strong mesoscale vortices and cross-shelf exchange after undergoing topographic
              scattering, the project will use laboratory experiments to see if scattering
              leads to strong mesoscale motion.  Laboratory experiments will also be used to
              look for subcritical and supercritical transitions in CTW propagation.  

The
              main experimental tool will be laboratory experiments in a rotating tank in
              homogeneous, two-layer, and linearly stratified configurations.   The tank will
              be fitted with both smooth shelf-slope topography, and abrupt topography such
              as canyons and ridges.   Background currents will be introduced by impulsively
              varying the rotation rate or by introducing a source-sink flow.  The laboratory
              experiments will be complemented with numerical modeling using modern coastal
              circulation models.   Data from the laboratory experiments will be used to
              validate the numerical models and then the numerical models will be used to
              extend results to more oceanic regimes.
