Award is for a project to further analyze seismic data collected
              during a cruise in 1999 that was undertaken to identify potential drill sites
              for a deep penetration, reference crustal section in the Guatemala basin.  The
              crust in this area was created during an episode of rapid spreading during the
              middle Miocene. Because of the rapid spreading rate, theory suggests that the
              depth to the dike-gabbro transition should be shallower and therefore more
              accessible to drilling. The proposed work will include 1) waveform modeling of
              bright UCR reflections, 2) integration of reflection and refraction datasets,
              3) slant stacking/basement velocity determination, 4) simultaneous P- and S-
              wave inversion/anisotropy investigations, 5) prestack depth migration of
              UCR/LCDRs, and 6) characterization of reflectivity patterns at other survey
              sites.
