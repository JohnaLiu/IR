Abstract    :
              This award to Professors Jiri Janata and Miroslawa Josowicz of the Georgia
              Institute of Technology is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program in the Chemistry Division. Polyanaline and the closely related
              poly(phenylene sulfidephenyleneamine) are to be modified with non-aqeuous acids
              and/or metal clusters in an effort to finely adjust the electronic work
              functions of these electrically conducting polymers.  In this way, gas sensors
              made from these polymers are to have greater sensitivity and selectivity to
              specific gas molecules.  A donacity scale of interactions is proposed to
              correlate gas/polymer interactions with the polymer work function, with the
              goal of more predictable sensor performance.  In addition, sensor fabrication
              methods are to be explored with a electrochemical molecular imprinting
              technique.

Chemical sensing arrays can be prepared from a matrix of
              electrically conducting polymers.  However, sensitivity, selectivity,
              robustness, and compatibility with solid-state fabrication processes remain as
              unresolved issues.  In this work, fundamental methods for tuning the
              selectivity of a polymer matrix will be explored along with a new strategy for
              fabrication.
