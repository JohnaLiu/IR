Abstract    :
              The objective of the 9 th International Conference on Microbial Genomes is to
              provide a consistent forum for investigators from different fields to interact
              with each other and to update the recent advances in microbial genomics. This
              conference will focus on (1) defining gene functions and regulatory networks
              using integrative, multidisciplinary approaches and (2) exploring genome
              sequence information to understand various biological processes. This
              conference will identify research gaps, problems, challenges, trends, and
              directions in microbial genomics. Attendees will gain an extensive appreciation
              of the current status and development in microbial genomics, especially
              functional genomics. Attendees will also gain insight into how questions in
              their own fields can be addressed by taking advantage of the massive genomic
              information already available. In addition, to train the next generation of
              genomic experts, this conference will establish fellowship awards to support
              graduate students, postdocs, and young faculty attending this conference.
              

This conference will consist of seven sessions: (1) Microbial genome
              diversity, evolution and microbial genome sequencing; (2) Bioinformatics and
              microarray-based genomic technologies; (3) Proteomics, cellular pathways and
              regulatory networks; (4) Functional genomics of bioremediation and carbon
              sequestration; (5) Functional genomics of microbial pathogens; (6) Functional
              genomics of model microorganisms, extremophiles and biofilms; and (7) Applied
              functional genomics. This conference will be held in Gatlinburg, TN, in
              October, 2001.
