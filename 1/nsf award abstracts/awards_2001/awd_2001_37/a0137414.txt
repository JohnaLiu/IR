Abstract    :
              Staff at the University of Wisconsin are developing the next version of the
              middle school instructional program, "Mathematics in Context."  Materials are
              also developed for teachers, administrators and parents.  The work is done is
              in collaboration with the Freudenthal Institute at the University of Utrecht,
              the Netherlands and the Encyclopedia Britannica.   Some units will receive only
              minor changes and corrections and others will be completely revised.  Among the
              more significant changes are: streamlining the fifth-grade units to facilitate
              the transition from elementary school reform materials; reducing the number of
              units at each grade level to facilitate more complete coverage; and the
              development of technology-based project units that could be used by groups of
              students outside regular class time.  The revisions are based on reviews by
              experts and the experience of use in classrooms.
