Description:  This award supports US-India cooperative research
              entitled Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD) - A Light Front Hamiltonian Approach. 
              US investigator James Vary,  Iowa State University (ISU) and Indian scientist
              Avaroth Harindranath, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP), Calcutta will
              develop a new approach to solve for spectra and other properties of the
              elementary particles, which features the union of two major theoretical tools
              in physics.  They will derive the Hamiltonian governing the dynamics from the
              light-front quantized theory of the strong interactions, QCD and then, they
              will solve for the wavefunctions of baryons and mesons expressed as amplitudes
              of multi-quark multi-gluon configurations using their newly developed methods
              of quantum many-body theory.  The investigators expect to resolve several
              outstanding problems in nuclear physics.     

Scope:  This activity has the
              potential to begin a strong collaboration between ISU and SINP.  ISU has
              developed strength in microscopic nuclear theory and in the fundamental theory
              of strong interactions, as well as strong expertise in computational physics. 
              SINP has a very strong tradition of basic research in physics; Harindranath has
              extensive experience in Light Front Quantization and in Hamiltonian-based
              methods in quantum field theory, which are central to this research.  This
              award will greatly benefit US-Indo contacts and will provide highly deserved
              support to a very talented Indian theorist.  The Office of International
              Science & Engineering and the Division of Physics are cofunders of this
              activity.  On the Indian side, the Department of Science and Technology (DST)
              supports this activity under the NSF/DST joint program.
