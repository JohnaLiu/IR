Abstract    :
              The Endeavor Deep along the Juan Fernandez microplate exposes a 50 km-long 3-4
              km-deep section of young ocean crust created at very fast spreading rates. 
              This projects involves combined geophysical surveys with in situ observations
              and sampling along the northeast wall of the Endeavor Deep.  High-resolution
              DSL-120 side-scan sonar will completely insonify the scarp and be used to map
              regional trends in lithology and structure at 10 m resolution.  Rock dredging
              will identify specific targets for more detailed sampling.  Digital imaging and
              petrologic sampling transects with Jason II will groundtruth the regional view
              and provide a high-resolution perspective of representative sections. 
              Deep-towed 3-component magnetometer data will map the magnetization of oceanic
              crust at these same scales.
