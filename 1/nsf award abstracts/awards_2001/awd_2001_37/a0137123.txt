Abstract    :
              	This research interviews 75 low- to moderate-income couples, mostly unmarried,
              who had a child in 2000 in Chicago, Milwaukee, or New York.  This award will
              fund the third wave of in-depth qualitative interviews with each parent in the
              sample.  Interviews include detailed accounts of the couples' relational
              history, ongoing couple dynamics, and relationships between each parent and the
              child.  Contributions to the child of time, formal and informal child-support,
              and in-kind support are described.  The study examines how some of these
              couples break up while others stay together, and how some fathers remain
              involved with their children while others do not.  Two theoretical approaches
              are important in guiding the analysis of the interviews.  Resource-based
              bargaining predicts that access to resources enables partners to get more of
              what they want in the relationship but may also make a partner more likely to
              leave if they are not getting what they want.  Gender theories assert that the
              social pressures on men to follow gender norms may override the otherwise
              stronger bargaining power of women but that this imbalance  may lead to women's
              exit.
