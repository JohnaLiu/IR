Abstract    :
              Laboratory studies of heterogeneous uptake and chemical reactions on model
              particles representing atmospheric dust will be carried out.  The apparatus
              used will be a newly developed Knudsen cell flow reactor equipped with a mass
              spectrometer for monitoring gaseous reactants and a Fourier-transform infrared
              spectrometer for detection of the condensed phase species.  The experiments
              will be carried out at temperature and relative humidity conditions
              representative of the middle/upper troposphere.  Specific reactions that will
              be studied as a function of relative humidity, temperature, particle mass and
              grain size include the hydrolysis of dinitrogen pentoxide (N205), the uptake of
              ozone, and the uptake and possible reaction of small organic molecules such as
              methanol.

This work is important because it will provide direct measurements
              for processes long believed to be important in the atmosphere.  Atmospheric
              aerosols affect the Earth's radiative budget and air quality.
