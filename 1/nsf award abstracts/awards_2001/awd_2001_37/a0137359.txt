              ABSTRACT

OCE-0137359

Reactive trace species such as Fe have an important
              effect on surface ocean chemistry and biological productivity.  However, other
              trace species that can influence primary production, affect the chemical
              distribution of other elements or can be used as tracers have received less
              attention.  For this reason, two PIs from the University of Southern
              Mississippi will participate in the 4th IOC cruise to the Northwest Pacific to
              determine Mn, H2O2 and Ga in surface waters, vertical profiles, rain samples,
              dust dissolution experiments and/or incubation experiments.  Determinations of
              H2O2 will be used for the following:  (1) add measurements to a growing dataset
              aimed at examining photochemical dissolution of dust in surface waters; (2)
              determine whether it aids in the solubilization of particulate Fe in the
              surface ocean; and (3) assess rates of photo-production and dark decay.  Values
              for Mn will be compared with Al and Ga to differentiate dust from shelf inputs.
               In addition, given the longer residence time for Mn in the surface ocean, the
              PI will attempt to use this metal to provide new insights into Fe inputs to the
              upper ocean.  Comparison of Mn with H2O2 will allow the PIs to determine
              reductive dissolution of manganese oxides in seawater.  Lastly, Ga
              concentrations will be compared with Al to assess if the former may not be a
              better proxy for dust inputs to the surface ocean, determine if any fraction is
              anthropogenic and whether any of the Ga is complexed with organics creating
              possible Ga-Fe competitive interactions.
