Abstract    :
              This project will monitor microearthquake activity, vent exit temperatures, and
              tidal pressures at the TAG hydrothermal site on the Mid?Atlantic Ridge 26
              degrees north. An active?source seismic survey will be focused on the TAG
              segment bathymetric high. The experiment will address the nature of the heat
              source driving hydrothermal circulation, the relationship between the faulting
              on the eastern flank and fluid flow at the mound, the possible existence of a
              low?velocity zone beneath the rise axis, and the hydraulic connectivity of the
              shallow TAG mound.
