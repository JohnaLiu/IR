Abstract    :
              Partial funding is provided for the purchase of a mass spectrometer at Texas A&M
              University to meet the requirements of paleoceanographic and paleoenvironmental
              research and teaching.  Bulk of the funding for the instrument (70%) is already
              available and additional funds have been committed by the institution to pay
              for uninterruptible power supply system.  The purchase of the instrument will
              benefit NSF funded research in paleoceanography and paleoclimatology.
