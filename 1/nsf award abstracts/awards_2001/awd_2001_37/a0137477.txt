Abstract    :
              This project consists of a series of experiments to study interacting cold atoms
              in far-off-resonant optical lattices (FORLs).   In one experiment the
              three-dimensional FORL will be adiabatically altered into a two-dimensional
              FORL to achieve effective one-dimensional collisional behavior that has been
              predicted to lead to a Tonks' gas.   Other experiments include continued
              efforts to achieve Bose condensation in a fully optical trap and atom
              interferometry experiments in the three-dimensional FORL.
