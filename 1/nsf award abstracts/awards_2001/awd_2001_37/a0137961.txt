Abstract    :
              This ADVANCE Fellows award, through the Divisions of Chemistry and Physics, 
              will support the research of Marcia O. Fenley in the Institute of Molecular
              Biophysics at Florida State University.  The project will use theoretical and
              computational approaches to elucidate the role of electrostatics on the
              structure and function of nucleic acids. Specifically, the ion atmosphere and
              electrostatic potential of model structures of triple-stranded nucleic acids
              will be examined using numerical counterion condensation and Poisson-Boltzmann
              methods. These calculations may elucidate the role of various ions on nucleic
              acid structure, conformation changes and phase transitions. 

This award is
              supported through the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE
              Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and
              engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of
              women in academic science and engineering careers.
