This project uses direct numerical simulation to look at the
              effectiveness of internal gravity wave radiation from rapidly varying almost
              geostrophic currents.  The primary scientific motivation is to determine to
              what degree such a process could explain the background level of internal wave
              radiation in the ocean, away from boundaries.  The work is guided both by
              observations of high internal wave energy near oceanic fronts and by numerical
              studies of the radiation of gravity waves during the life cycle of baroclinic
              eddies in the atmosphere.  The approach consists of using two types of
              numerical models, a hydrostatic isopycnal model (HIM) and a non-hydrostatic
              Navier-Stokes solver (S-FIT), at high spatial resolution to examine the
              nonlinear evolution of instabilities on a baroclinic jet.  The project includes
              the use of a novel diagnostic tool for separating the internal wave component. 
              A balanced model will be used to invert the potential vorticity field.   The
              resulting balanced vortical flow will then be subtracted from the full
              flow.
