Abstract    :
              The objective of the program is to provide an opportunity for seven
carefully
              selected undergraduate students to learn firsthand the nature of
mathematical
              research.  The participants will conduct independent
investigations, under the
              guidance of experienced researchers, on problems
in graph theory and
              combinatorics.
