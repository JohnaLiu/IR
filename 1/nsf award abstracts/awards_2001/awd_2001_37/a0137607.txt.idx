Abstract    :
              Multi-scale, vertical, and horizontal topographic heterogeneity is a critical
              property of wetland ecosystems.  The lack of topographic heterogeneity in
              restored systems could be a key constraint on their progress toward structural
              and functional equivalency with undisturbed sites.  This project will test the
              role of heterogeneity in the progress of ecosystem restoration.  We hypothesize
              that topographic heterogeneity enhances the development of restored wetlands
              and predict that ecosystem structure and function will develop much more
              rapidly where topographic heterogeneity is added.  We will test this hypothesis
              using an 8-ha "model marsh" in the Tijuana River National Estuarine Research
              Reserve in San Diego County, CA.  To maximize scientific benefits, the site was
              designed as a large-scale, replicated experiment.  This one-of-a-kind project
              has tremendous potential to advance restoration science due to its
              state-of-the-art design, replicated treatments, and large scale.  Over time,
              the replicated cells are expected to diverge in structure and function, as
              tidal creek morphology and marsh surface elevations respond to erosion and
              sedimentation; colonization by vegetation and invertebrates (including founder
              effects/chance establishments); use by fish; and landscape position (distance
              along the tidal channel that feeds all three creek networks).  Chance
              establishments by plant seeds and invertebrates brought into the system by
              tidal water could be particularly important.  We will collect critical baseline
              data as we document early conditions at the model marsh, and assess changes in
              structure, function, and variability during marsh development.  Such early
              information will strengthen our ability to predict and model the viability of
              other wetland restoration projects.
