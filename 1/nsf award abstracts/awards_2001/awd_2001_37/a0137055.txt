Abstract    :
              The four collaborating principal investigators in this project (Stacia L.
              Haynie, Reginald S. Sheehan, Donald R. Songer, and C. Neal Tate) will continue
              and expand their efforts to develop for public use a systematic, replicable
              database to support comparative analyses of courts, judges, and their behavior.
              To further this objective, the principal investigators will extend and expand
              the multi-country database they are creating with support from National Science
              Foundation awards (9975180, 9975237, 9975315, 9975323). That database supports
              descriptive and theoretical research by the whole scholarly community concerned
              with courts and judges and their functions and behaviors across a number of
              national/cultural boundaries. It also allows the principal investigators to
              pursue an initial research agenda highlighting substantive areas that can be
              fruitfully studied across many nations and many times.  The development of this
              database rests on a central proposition: Theory and data are intimately
              related.  As new data become available, new theories and hypotheses are created
              and tested.  For the overwhelming majority of the world's courts, social
              scientists lack even the most basic descriptive data summarizing their
              institutional characteristics, historical development, functional processes, or
              institutional and individual behaviors. With little more than such simple,
              descriptive data, scholars might be able to answer any number of theoretically
              interesting questions. The database that has been compiled under the previous
              awards show how even a simple analysis of those data provides impressive
              answers to questions, such as "What Do Supreme Courts Do?" and how general is
              "Party Capability Theory?"  The initial project contains a sample of 100
              reported supreme court decisions (or the universe, whichever is smaller) per
              year for 15 years for a sample eight nations with Anglo-American legal systems.
              The principal investigators will extend the temporal coverage of the database
              to include the 34 most recent years of available data and to expand the
              national and cultural coverage of the database by adding an important civil
              law, non-English-using court, the Suprema Corte de la Justicia de la Nacion of
              Mexico.
