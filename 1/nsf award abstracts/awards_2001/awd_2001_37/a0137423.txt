Abstract    :
              Michael Heinekey, Department of Chemistry, University of Washington is supported
              by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for
              continued explorations of metal-dihydrogen interactions or metal-alkane
              interactions. He uses unique NMR techniques including  photolysis of precursors
              in the NMR probe; very low temperature NMR, exchange coupling and tritium NMR
              to explore the nature of these weak bonds. Heinekey also studies elongated
              dihydrogen complexes which display novel vibrational and dynamic properties
              that may provide a "snapshot" of an H-H bond rupture process. 

The education
              and training of future scientists and the development of new NMR methods are
              major impacts of this work. The activation of hydrogen is a critical reaction
              biologically (hydrogenase enzymes) and industrially. By better understanding
              how various metal species interact with hydrogen, better homogeneous catalysts
              and processes may be designed.
