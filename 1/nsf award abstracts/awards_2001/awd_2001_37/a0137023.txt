The proposed work will examine the
              interactions of jets and eddies with coastlines and shelves using idealized
              models based on contour dynamics.  The approximate model of Flierl (1999) will
              be extended to include tilted and curved coasts and asymmetric jets in order to
              determine the ways in which ocean currents meander and form eddies as they
              leave the coast and go into the deep ocean.  Additional studies of the
              interaction of rings with shelves will be done with a coupled barotropic 11/2
              layer model that is extended to include the beta effect.  The baroclinic model
              will be used to study the conditions that influence eddy detachment from a
              coast. In cases where steady solutions are found, the linearized contour
              dynamics model will be used to examine the stability of these flows.
