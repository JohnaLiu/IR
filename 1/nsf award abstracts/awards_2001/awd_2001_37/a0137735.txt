Abstract    :
              The overall aim of this project is to develop a set of videos on a CD-ROM
              centering on the investigations of pond organisms to be used by elementary and
              middle school teachers as complements to existing life science curricula and
              environmental education programs.  This product will be published nationally by
              a commercial publisher.

During the three years of the project the videos
              will be pilot tested by EDC and the New England Aquarium staff and then
              field-tested in a range of school districts.

The collaborators in the
              project will be the Education Development Center and the New England Aquarium.
              Peace River Films and Squid Country Safari will be subcontractors producing the
              videos and adapting them for a CD-ROM.
