The
              Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar (MAMLS), formed in
the fall of 1982
              under the aegis of Lee Stanley, has supported
3-4 regional meetings per year
              of 1-2 days' duration since then.
These meetings are held at various locations
              and cover a broad
spectrum of mathematical logic with particular emphasis
              on
complexity theory, theoretical computer science, fragments of
arithmetic,
              pure and applied model theory, proof theory,
recursion theory, set theory,
              subsystems of analysis in
accordance with the program of H.  Friedman and S.
              Simpson, and
topos theory.  NSF support is provided for some of the
              expenses
of the speakers and attendees, in particular of the
              graduate
students.

Via the meetings sponsored, the MAMLS grant maintains
              the
vitality of the field of mathematical logic.  Special emphasis is
placed
              on enhancing the participation of younger researchers and
members of
              traditionally underrepresented groups, especially
women.  This is done by
              providing an intellectual forum in which
all interested persons are invited to
              contribute and in which
there are lectures on current topics of research.
