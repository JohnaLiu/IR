The research program outlined in this proposal
              is driven by the need to develop novel means of acquiring, storing,
              manipulating and synthesizing signals and images for use in a feedback loop. 
              This is the essential mandate of controlled active vision in which one uses a
              combination of techniques from systems and control, signal and image
              processing, as well as a computer vision for this purpose.  The design of novel
              techniques for using visual information in control systems appears in a number
              of practical systems problems ranging from remote controlled weapons and
              vehicles to telesurgery, manufacturing systems, and ATR.  Moreover, these
              efforts are leading to enhanced man-machine interfaces for interactions with
              computers.  

In this research, the PI will consider certain novel methods
              based on the notion of "optimal mass transport" for such problems in controlled
              active vision.  This type of technique has appeared in econometrics, fluid
              dynamics, transportation, statistical physics, shape optimization, expert
              systems, meteorology, and nonlinear control analysis and synthesis.
