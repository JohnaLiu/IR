Abstract    :
              This project will investigate interrelationships between feeding and swimming
              behavior in the evolution of sharks. The first study tests whether ecological
              habitat influences swimming behavior in sharks.  High-speed video and
              electromyography will be used to analyze fin, body, and tail movements during
              swimming in the spiny dogfish shark, a shark that is an open ocean swimmer, and
              the bamboo shark, a bottom-dwelling shark.  The study addresses the question of
              whether open ocean sharks swim differently than other sharks. Another question
              that will be addressed is whether bottom-dwelling and open ocean sharks can
              control their fin movements to change the forces generated during swimming. 
              The second study investigates the feeding mechanism of sharks eating hard prey.
               Feeding on hard prey is rare in sharks. High-speed video and electromyography
              will be used to analyzing head and jaw movements and muscle activity during
              feeding.  The PI will analyze bamboo sharks eating hard prey, bamboo sharks
              eating soft prey, and bonnethead sharks eating hard prey.  The results will be
              used to test previous predictions for jaw force and lever systems in sharks.
              This research will increase our understanding of feeding and swimming behavior
              in sharks.
