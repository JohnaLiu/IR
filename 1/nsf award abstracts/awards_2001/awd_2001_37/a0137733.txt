Abstract    :
              This project will capitalize on the availability of an organized data set
              consisting of thousands of video clips from the WGBH and PBS digital library. 
              This resource is a searchable, Web-based repository of contextualized
              multimedia materials teachers can access easily and productively for their own
              professional development.  With this award WGBH will produce a set of
              supporting resources to amplify the relevance and impact of this digital
              library for both students and teachers.  These supporting resources include
              multimedia presentation features for curriculum units that feature
              self-contained video and interactive modules; descriptive annotations and
              background essays to accompany each asset in the collection; and detailed
              lesson plans and discussion questions for using these resources to support deep
              learning of the content.  It is anticipated that five curriculum units will be
              produced, with each unit consisting of two or more modules.  The curriculum
              units will be developed for the high school level and the five units will
              include genetics, ecology, evolution, cells and biochemistry.
