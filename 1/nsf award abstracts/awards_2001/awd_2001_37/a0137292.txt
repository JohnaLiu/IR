This award provides funds to
              partially support group travel to the seventh international Valencia meeting on
              Bayesian Statistics. The money, primarily, support junior researchers and
              graduate students with limited sources of funding. Members of the
              underrepresented groups will be actively recruited and encouraged to apply. The
              meeting will be held in Tenerife, Spain, from June 1-6, 2002. It brings
              together leading experts in the area of Bayesian Statistics and junior
              researchers, facilitating scientific interactions and providing a stimulating
              environment for the exchange of ideas. A pre-conference tutorial will be held
              that is targeted towards junior investigators, graduate students and people
              with limited exposure to the vast developments in the area of Bayesian
              statistics.
