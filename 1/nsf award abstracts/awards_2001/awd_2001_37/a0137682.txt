Abstract    :
              This project involves revising the Middle Grades MATH Thematics curriculum, a
              comprehensive grades 6-8 mathematics curriculum developed with NSF funding from
              1992 through 1997.  Revisions will be informed by data collected from various
              stakeholders, including MATH Thematics teachers, research mathematicians and
              mathematics educators.  Revised student materials will take advantage of new
              technologies and will be field tested in diverse middle-school settings.  The
              professional development component of the curriculum will be greatly expanded. 
              Materials for parents and administrators that are tailored to MATH Thematics
              will be developed.  New materials will be designed that can be used with
              special learners, and existing multicultural materials will be evaluated and
              revised.  Formative and summative evaluation of the project will be conducted. 
              Cost sharing includes substantial contributions from the University of Montana
              and the publisher.
