Abstract    :
              
This grant will fund the participation of about ten United States scientists
              at a Conference on Computational Linear Algebra with Applications to be held in
              the Czech Republic in August 2002. The theme of the conference is of basic
              importance in many areas of science and engineering. In particular, the topics
              of the conference address problems encountered in industrial and manufacturing
              modeling, chemical processing, material sciences, and simulation of fluid
              flows. The meeting is modeled after a very successful U.S.-Czech Workshop on
              Iterative Methods and Parallel Computing at the same location in June 1997. As
              at the last meeting, attendance is expected from many scientists from several
              Eastern and Central European countries who rarely have a chance to travel to
              the United States. Participation in this conference will allow U.S. scientists
              to present their research to this audience, and to learn first-hand about
              recent developments in Eastern Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union.
              It is expected that the meeting will foster new collaborative projects.
              Priority will be given to funding the attendance of advanced graduate students
              and young scientists.
