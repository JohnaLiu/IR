Gwendolen Hines will collaborate with Konstantin Mischaikow on
              a mathematical model for the evolution of dispersal rates in a population which
              experiences both spatial and temporal heterogeneity.  Together, they will
              analyze models with dispersal mechanisms other than simple diffusion,
              specifically dispersal described by integral operators. They will search for
              the existence of stable solutions for different combinations of spatial and
              temporal homogeneity and heterogeneity. The global dynamics of the system will
              be studied. 

Gwendolen Hines has been out of the full-time academic
              mathematics workforce for several years to care for her young daughter. She
              plans to reestablish her research career by spending a semester at Georgia
              Tech's Center for Dynamical Systems and Nonlinear Studies to work on a problem
              in evolutionary biology having to do with how natural selection is related to
              dispersal rates. Upon returning to the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, she
              will resume her full-time tenure-track position in mathematics. She will
              continue to work on this research problem, intensifying the collaboration with
              summer visits to Georgia Tech. At Nebraska, she will promote the interaction
              between Mathematics and Biology departments, as part of the university's
              initiative in Quantitative and Integrative Biology. Dr. Hines remains active in
              outreach activities for girls and women in mathematics.
