This
              proposal, bridging the gap between what users know and what they need to know,
              pursues the problems of extending, refining, and validating a theory-based
              cognitive walkthrough for designing a complete informational website and for
              assessing website usability, parameterizing the walkthrough to validly simulate
              diverse user groups.

The walkthrough was developed to facilitate the design
              of applications with GUIs that enable users to discover by exploration how to
              perform new tasks, simulating user behavior step-by-step for a given task on a
              given walk-up-and-use interface. Navigation is guided by the information
              scentific assigned a stronger value to the desired goal toward the target web
              page in the cognitive walkthrough of a website (CWW). 

CWW relies on Latent
              Semantic Analysis to objectively estimate the degree of semantic similarity
              (information scent) between representative user goal statements and
              heading/link texts on each web page, and to assess the probability that a
              particular user group can effectively learn from texts they discovered by
              navigating the website. A series of experiments will first parameterize the CWW
              for college-educated users navigating informational/instructional websites and
              then parameterize the CWW to validly simulate navigation behaviors of diverse
              user groups, including users with 6th-, 9th-, and 12th-grade reading levels in
              English.
