Abstract    :
              This research is devoted to the theory of quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) organic
              conductors (TMTSF)2X and (TMTTF)2X, where TMTSF is
              tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene, TMTTF is tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene, and X
              represents a monovalent inorganic anion, such as PF6 and ClO4.  These materials
              demonstrate an antonishingly rich variety of physical properties and states:
              metallic, insulating, superconductive, charge-and spin-density-wave states,
              antiferromagnetism, spin-Peierls states, and the state of Mott-Hubbard
              paramagnetic insulator.  They exhibit a multitude of magnetic oscillations as a
              function of the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic field.  A strong
              magnetic field induces the cascade of phase transitions between the
              magnetic-field-induced spin-density waves (FISDW), which exhibit the quantum
              Hall effect.

Theoretical research will be conducted on the following topics:
              fractional quantum Hall numbers of the subgap electron states; electron states
              in superconducting junctions; bound electron states at the superconducting and
              FISDW vortices and impurities; collective modes in the triplet superconducting
              state; and, coesistence of metallic Fermi surface and charge gap.  There will
              be close collaboration with experiments and an emphasis on real
              materials.
%%%
Theoretical research will be conducted on a novel class of
              organic conducting materials which display a rich variety of properties.  These
              materials are of great fundamental interest due these properties arising in
              organic materials and of great practical interest due to many potential
              applications.
