Abstract    :
              With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor
              Sherwood and his coworkers at Kansas State University are exploring the
              corrosion of reactive metals in contact with liquids.  Using anaerobic and UHV
              transfer cell methods, coupled with direct abrasion methods in deoxygenated
              solutions, oxide free metal surfaces are prepared and exposed to phosphate and
              other corrosion resistant overlayers.  These layers, and the mechanisms of
              their formation and stability, are examined using a range of surface sensitive
              probes, principally valence band photoelectron spectroscopy.  Coupled with
              quantum chemistry calculations for spectral assignment, this suite of tools
              provides a detailed and powerful probe of the complex chemistry of the
              corrosion process.  These tools are being made widely available to the surface
              science community as a result of this research project.  

Understanding the
              process of corrosion and oxidation on structural metal surfaces is an issue of
              vital economic importance.  Professor Sherwood and his colleagues at Kansas
              State University are studying this process using a variety of tools that allow
              the formation of well-characterized oxide and phosphate overlayers, and their
              analysis using photoelectron spectroscopic methods.  This work promises a
              fundamental understanding of corrosion and corrosion prevention, significant
              real-world problems.
