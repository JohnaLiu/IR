PROPOSAL # 0137224

Award is for a
              project to acquire and analyze all available marine seismic reflection data
              from the Nankai Trough region. This region is a high priority locality for
              drilling into an active seismogenic zone; an important objective for the
              Integrated Ocean Drilling Program.  The goal of this study is to identify the
              best transect along which to acquire the 3D seismic surveys necessary for IODP
              rise drilling in the Nankai Seismogenic Zone, and to locate the best sites for
              non-riser drilling of seaward reference sites and landward prism test sites.
              This work will make it possible to assess globally important subduction
              processes such as the effects of seamount subduction /collision on accretionary
              prism evolution.
