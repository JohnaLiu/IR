Abstract    :
              Karen Goldberg, Department of Chemistry, University of Washington, is supported
              by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for her
              studies on the selective activation and functionalization of the C-H bonds of
              alkanes.  She will conduct studies of the mechanisms, energetics, requirements
              and scopes of reaction steps involved in platinum catalyzed alkane oxidation.
              Reactions to be investigated include the oxidative addition/reductive
              elimination of C-H and C-O bonds at platinum centers and reactions of platinum
              complexes with dioxygen.

The selective activation and functionalization of
              alkanes is a major goal in organometallic chemistry. The production of useful
              chemicals directly from natural gas and other alkane reserves would have
              significant economic and environmental advantages over current processes.
              Students and postdoctoral associates will also be trained in important skills
              of synthesis, characterization, kinetics and mechanistic studies.
