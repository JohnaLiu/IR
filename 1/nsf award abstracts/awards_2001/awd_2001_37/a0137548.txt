Abstract    :
              Many chemicals released into the environment disrupt the function of endogenous
              hormones by acting at their receptors and/or by influencing hormone production
              by interfering with synthesizing enzymes. These endocrine disrupting chemicals
              (EDCs), which have been found to have effects in several taxa during
              development and in adulthood, exert their greatest effects in tissues that are
              responsive to endogenous steroid hormones. These responsive tissues (e.g.,
              reproductive tract, brain) often differ by gender (i.e., are sexually
              dimorphic) and are involved in display of gender-specific behavior (e.g.,
              reproductive or courtship behavior). The overall objective of the research plan
              is to determine whether exposure of songbirds to environmental endocrine
              disruptors affects the normal function of sexually dimorphic (and
              hormone-sensitive) structures. In particular, effects on the brain regions that
              control singing (song control system), the song behavior itself, and female
              responses to song will be assessed after non-stressful exposure to EDCs.
              

Abnormal function of the song control system could have implications for
              the ability of males to attract mates and of females to choose them, which
              ultimately could affect songbird populations. Songbirds have long been
              effective models for investigating hormonal effects on brain and behavior; as
              such, they also could serve as powerful models for investigating EDC effects on
              brain and behavior.
