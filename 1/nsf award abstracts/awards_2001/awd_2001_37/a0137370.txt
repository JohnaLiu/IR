Abstract    :
              This award supports an American Physiological Society conference entitled "The
              Power Of Comparative Physiology: Evolution, Integration And Application,"
              scheduled for August 24-28, 2002 in San Diego, California. The fundamental goal
              of this conference is to bring together comparative biologists who utilize a
              diversity of approaches including molecular, cellular, organ, and organismal
              physiology/biochemistry, functional morphology, biomechanics and biophysics,
              ecology and evolutionary biology to understand physiological processes and
              traits. The meeting will highlight the accomplishments that have occurred since
              the last large meeting on comparative physiology, and more importantly, will
              provide a forum to showcase new directions and approaches.

The specific aims
              of this proposal are to: 1) Convene an internationally recognized
              interdisciplinary group of investigators to explore the rapid changes that
              comparative physiology has undergone as a result of the incorporation of a
              variety of new tools and technologies into the discipline; 2) Promote
              widespread participation of young scientists with an emphasis on women and
              under-represented minorities, through a travel award program; and 3) Interest
              new investigators and students in pursuing research using comparative
              approaches to understand physiological processes and traits.
