WORKSHOP:  The
              Future Grand Challenges of Computer Science and Engineering

This effort
              supports a conference to ask the question:  What is the nature of the future
              "grand challenge" problems in computer science and engineering?  The conference
              organizers believe that many deep and exciting issues remain.  The purpose of
              the proposed conference is to provoke "out-of-the-box" thinking and thus to
              hasten the next "golden age".  The conference will serve as an experiment and
              possible prototype for a series of conferences on grand research challenges in
              computer science and engineering.
