Abstract    :
              This project will take advantage of advanced technologies and
strategies proven
              successful in online role-playing games to create
exciting opportunities for
              children in an after school context. There are
almost no examples of learning
              environments that build on lessons and
strategies from the commercial success
              of 3D online, role-playing games,
environments that are populated by tens of
              thousands of users each day.
Leveraging 3-D technologies and principles so
              successful for the gaming
community to develop educationally meaningful
              environments is a topic of
which we, as an educational community, know very
              little and which has much
potential to engage typically underrepresented
              groups in SMT learning.
This work is exploratory and has exciting potential
              both in terms of its
direct service to the disadvantaged children at the local
              Boys and Girls
Clubs and in terms of the broader implications of the research
              to inform
the education community.
 
Our 18 month relationship with the Boys
              and Girls Clubs is currently
strong and recently Compaq and Microsoft donated
              $100,000 in equipment,
software, and service to both local Boys and Girls
              Clubs to create
Technology Centers. The Quest Atlantis program is viewed as an
              exciting
opportunity to integrate the computers in Club programming, and
              staff, and
space will be committed to the project. Continuing this
              relationship and
leveraging this still-new technology and the current interest
              in
innovating with this equipment and software creates a timely opportunity.
