Abstract    :
              The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program will be continued in
              the School of Physics of the Georgia Institute of Technology. The program will
              encompass Chemical, Optical, Nonlinear, and Condensed Matter Physics but also
              has been expanded to include projects in MEMS (Micro-electrical Mechanical
              Systems), Biomedical Imaging, and Material Science- Microscopy. Twelve REU
              students participate in the program  (ten supported by NSF, two by Georgia
              Tech), with the choice of participation in the research groups of 18 faculty
              investigators. The considerable experience of the participating faculty in
              undergraduate research training furnishes an ideal environment to pursue
              undergraduate research training among the supportive cast including graduate
              students and postdoctoral fellows. The closely monitored research environment
              is supplemented by (1) weekly seminars presented by both participating faculty
              and students, (2) faculty-student luncheons, (3) excursions to advanced
              technology facilities including Lockheed Aircraft, (4) a reasonable but not
              intrusive number of organized social events as students are encouraged to avail
              themselves of several cultural opportunities in the Atlanta area dictated by
              their individual interest. At the end of the summer session, each student
              presents the results of their research endeavors in a REU Symposium run in the
              American Physical Society format of 15-20- minute presentations.
