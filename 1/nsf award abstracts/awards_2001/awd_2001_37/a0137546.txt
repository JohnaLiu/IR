This grant provides three years of partial salary support for
              technical assistance in the Radiogenic Isotope Laboratory in the Department of
              Geological Sciences at the Ohio State University.  The Radiogenic Isotope
              Laboratory is a modern facility with new, first-class physical facilities that
              house a clean room and both thermal-ionization and noble-gas mass
              spectrometers, plus a full array of ancillary equipment, to support the
              research measurements.  The laboratory conducts isotope geochemical and
              geochronologic research on diverse and wide-ranging issues.  The principal
              isotopic systems of current investigation are Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, U-Pb, K-Ca and also
              K-Ar especially with the 40Ar/39Ar technique.  Studies include both isotope
              tracer research, using the radiogenic isotopes (e.g., Sr, Nd, and Pb), and
              geochronologic determinations (e.g., 40Ar/39Ar and Rb-Sr).  Overall, the
              research objectives range from the fundamental and methodological to the
              applied and topical.  In addition to the PI and intramural colleagues and
              students, the laboratory is utilized by a large number of extramural
              professionals and students, either as guest workers or by sending specimens for
              analysis.  Research activities of the PI and Ohio State University colleagues
              as well as a number of external scientists with on-going collaborative and
              cooperative projects are quite varied.  The topics range from geological and
              geochemical earth science to environmental and biomedical.
