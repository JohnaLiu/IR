Title:          ADVANCE Fellows: Aspect Oriented Framework for
              Software Development

Project Proposed:


This proposal, applying
              aspect-oriented (AO) approach, aims at building a framework design to open
              software systems in a systematic way that factors into the initial design the
              capacity to evolve, be extended, and be adaptive to future changes. The work
              will employ the Dynamic Weaver Framework (DWF) under development by the
              Concurrent Programming Research group lead by the PI. This framework allows for
              a separation of software system aspects from the system components, providing a
              systematic well-defined structure to open the software system to enable
              evolution, extendibility, and adaptation. Motivated by the increased complexity
              resulting from adding more basic software components, this research addresses
              the following for AO software systems:

Modeling
Supporting lifecycle
              development with End-to-End automation  
Experimenting with more real-life
              applications, with current case tools supporting the model, and with
              
on-demand system re-modularization

Aspect-oriented software development is
              an approach that cuts across functional components to present different views
              of software products. It supports and enhances software evolution by focusing
              on separation of concern issues, particularly to distributed
              systems.

Results from this work are expected to demonstrate slower
              degradation in component cohesiveness, and improvements in maintainability and
              evolution capacity of systems that require inter-component dependencies and
              communication.
