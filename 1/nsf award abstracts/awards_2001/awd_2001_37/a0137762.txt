This award is being made an a Small Grant for
              Exploratory Research (SGER).  The Principal Investigator will modify existing
              software tools to produce three-dimensional charts of the arctic ice canopy
              using acoustic data collected during the 1998 and 1999 SCience ICe EXercises
              (SCICEX). Maps of ice keel/lead locations and ice thickness can resolve the
              ongoing debate regarding whether the mass of the arctic ice canopy is, like the
              extent of sea-ice cover, measurably decreasing, and can improve climatic
              modeling. The Principal Investigator will use a unique dataset that has been
              collected and provides a rare opportunity to channel expertise and technology
              that have been developed in one field of research (seafloor mapping) to a very
              different set of scientific problems. In addition, the proposed project has
              practical applications for the U.S. Navy's nuclear submarine force and could
              engender future SCICEX seafloor mapping collaborations.
