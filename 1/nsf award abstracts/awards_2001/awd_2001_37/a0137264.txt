Abstract    :
              The Grand Valley State University Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
              program will provide undergraduate students with a complete mathematical
              research experience. This involves problem selection, 
literature searches,
              background work, the work on the research problem itself, learning about
              research in areas of mathematics other than an individual's particular problem
              area, and dissemination of results through writing and giving presentations. To
              help achieve these goals, we will build a community of students and faculty,
              supporting students to make a gradual transition to intellectual independence.
              Students in the program will collaborate with nationally recognized mathematics
              professors who have a history of success in research projects with
              undergraduates. For the REU in the summer of 2002, research areas will be
              chosen from fractal geometry, distance geometry, topology, differential games,
              dynamical systems, and wavelets.
