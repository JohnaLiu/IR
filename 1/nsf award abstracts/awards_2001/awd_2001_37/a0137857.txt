Abstract    :
              This dissertation project provides travel funds to gather data in the U.S. and
              the Russia to examine the changing relationship between technology and Soviet
              society using rocketry as an entry point. The case of missile technology
              provides an excellent window into the relationship between technology and the
              state. The project focuses on how engineers and scientists handled the tensions
              between indigenous and appropriated technology on the one hand, and the
              tradeoffs between incremental and radical innovation on the other. Through the
              lens of Soviet rocketry, the project focuses on these two dichotomies within
              the broader context of Soviet history, and explores the relationship between
              technology (indigenous, appropriated, radical, incremental) and three elements
              of the Soviet state: public discourse on the role of rocket technology in
              modernization, the creation and evolution of institutions to develop rockets,
              and state policy towards rocket technology. The project will trace these
              relationships over a forty-year span from the emergence of the popular
              discourse on rocketry in the 1920s to the galvanization of industrial power
              that led to the launch of Sputnik in 1957. Finally, the project hopes to
              provide some final thoughts on the nature of knowledge and its relationship to
              state, society, and ideas. Four archives in Russia, and two in the U.S. will be
              visited under NSF funding.
