              Fellows: Data Mining Algorithms for Business Intensive Applications

This
              proposal, framing business intelligence applications as concrete theoretical
              problems, develops data mining techniques for applications in customer
              management, wireless mining, and product affinities. The work, studying
              clustering measures, alternate embedding techniques, and computational
              complexity, involves designing computationally efficient algorithms that find
              approximately good answers. The scalability and I/O efficiency of proposed
              algorithms will also be studied. Two problems are mentioned for: 
              (1)Identifying wireless communities and product affinities: the Maximum Edge
              Bi-clique problem and
(2) Customer segmentation, text clustering, new
              clustering measures that combine inter and intra distances: 
the Conjunctive
              Clustering problem.  The algorithms can be applied to various areas, including
              e-commerce. Results from this work are expected to impact (3) Customer
              relationship management by segmenting the customer population to target
              marketing programs more effectively and  (4)Cell phone usage data to enable
              wireless companies to discover patterns in wireless access.
