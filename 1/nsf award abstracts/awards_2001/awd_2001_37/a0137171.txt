ABSTRACT

OCE-0137171

In this project, researchers at the Texas A & M
              University will perform analysis, quality control, and adjustment of the
              transmissometer data from the Hawaii Oceanographic Time-Series (HOT) and from
              the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) data sets collected during the last
              decade. These data were collected at fixed locations in the Atlantic and
              Pacific Oceans and provide important data on seasonal and interannual
              variations, covering all seasons at both sites. The unprocessed or
              pre-processed data reside in the appropriate laboratories, but several
              different characteristic errors are in the data, making them unreliable for
              modeling and analysis in their present condition.  The researchers will analyze
              the data, control their quality and make necessary adjustments. The adjusted
              data will be used for assessment of the regional and seasonal Beam Attenuation
              - Particulate Organic Carbon relationships. After checking and adjustment, the
              data will be posted on HOT, BATS and TAMU web-servers.  The data will be 
              analyzed for seasonal and interannual variability and will be made available to
              the scientific community for the purpose of modeling ocean carbon cycles or
              evaluating the output from existing models.
