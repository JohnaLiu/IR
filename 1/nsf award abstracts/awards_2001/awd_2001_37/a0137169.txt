The physics governing the many
              paths of the Kuroshio will be investigated using dynamical systems analysis of
              barotropic and baroclinic quasigeostrophic model solutions.  The dynamical
              systems tools will be used to determine the qualitative nature of model
              simulations of the Kuroshio's path off the coast of Japan.  A baroclinic
              quasigeostrophic regional model and its adjoint will be used comparatively with
              existing solutions from previous model studies.  It is expected that the
              bifurcation diagram will be similar between the barotropic and baroclinic
              systems but that the solutions will exhibit significant baroclinic effects. The
              adjoint of the baroclinic quasigeostrophic model will be used to investigate
              the sensitivity of the model to different types of perturbations and to
              determine the influence of assimilation of observations on the model
              predictions in each different small and large meander case.  The data
              assimilation study will also help determine which observations predict the
              transition from one state to another. In addition, this portion of the study
              will help discriminate between the adequacies of different physics in different
              models for representing the natural variability of the system. This study will
              lead to a better understanding of the Kuroshio system off Japan, the different
              physical mechanisms that generate bimodality of the Kuroshio, and it has the
              potential to yield guidance towards the critical set of observations that
              capture the behavior of the system.
