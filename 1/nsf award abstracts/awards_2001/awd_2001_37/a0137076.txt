Abstract    :
              The symposium will explore the role of law in changes taking place in both
              post-industrial and industrializing Pacific Rim nations. Papers will be
              presented at the symposium focusing on cultural, social and economic issues
              that affect the development of legal institutions and legal doctrine throughout
              the region. The trend towards globalization stretches the significance of these
              issues beyond the borders of individual Pacific Rim countries. "External"
              popular culture as well as legal culture comes on the heels of expanded free
              trade, but existing local cultures resist simple transplantation. Many Pacific
              Rim nations, whether highly developed or not, are in the midst of important
              struggles over the place of legal institutions and legality in their responses
              to globalization. This award supports travel and expenses for approximately
              twelve scholars from Pacific-Rim nations such as The Philippines, Malaysia,
              Indonesia, China, Vietnam, and Thailand to join with social scientists from
              Japan, Korea, the United States and Canada.  The symposium will be held prior
              to the 2002 annual meeting of the Law and Society Association in Vancouver.
