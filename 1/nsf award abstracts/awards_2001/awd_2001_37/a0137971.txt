Abstract    :
              The PI plans to develop a strong program of research and education activities in
              experimental magnetic resonance at George Mason University. The planned
              research consists of two lines of investigation:  (i) study of the physical
              mechanisms responsible for the relaxation rates associated with quadrupolar
              nuclei in crystalline materials using nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR);  (ii)
              study of the flow of polarization from laser-polarized xenon to its surrounding
              environment using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The proposed research on
              NQR has applications to the detection of landmines, explosives, and narcotics. 
              The proposed work on NMR/laser-polarized xenon has applications to quantum
              computing, as well as many other important applications to increase the
              sensitivity of NMR.  By exposing women students to research projects on the
              proposed topics, the PI hopes to encourage them to continue their careers in
              science, engineering, and related fields.

The planned education activities
              include the development of engaging introductory level courses to retain
              student interest in physics, the introduction of new laboratory experiments and
              demonstrations to promote hands-on learning of physical principles, mentorship
              of women students, and supervision of undergraduate and graduate research
              projects.  It is anticipated that the ADVANCE award will not only advance the
              PI's career in academic science, but also allow her to serve as a role model
              and mentor to women students who are pursuing careers in academic science,
              engineering, or related fields.
