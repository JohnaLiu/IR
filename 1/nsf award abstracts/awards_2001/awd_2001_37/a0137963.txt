Abstract    :
              This award supports international collaboration on electrospinning of novel
              polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers.  Research into the electrospinning of
              polymer nanofibers and their applications in composites is currently being
              conducted by the investigator at the University of Nebraska.  This
              collaboration with researchers at the Institute of Polymer Science at the
              University of Stellenbosh in South Africa brings complimentary expertise in the
              synthesis, modification and characterization of these PAN nanofibers.  In
              addition, modeling and theoretical optimization of nanofiber assemblies for
              improved thermal stability and reduced residual stresses will be performed at
              the University of Natal-Durban, South Africa. 

Active participation between
              the research groups includes graduate student participation and student
              exchanges.  It is expected that this will lead to advances in nanotechnology
              and to extended collaborations as this research moves forward.
