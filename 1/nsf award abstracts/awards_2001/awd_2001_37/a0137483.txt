This linguistics project involves field research on the Yukon
              dialect of Deg Xinag (also known as Ingalik, Dig Hit'an), an endangered
              Athabascan language spoken in several villages along the lower Yukon and
              Kuskokwim Rivers and tributaries thereof.  Primary results of the research will
              be a grammar and a dictionary.  A special topic of investigation for the
              grammar is a sequence of tense.  The proposed project will use standard
              linguistic interview techniques to elicit words and sentences, and
              grammaticality judgments.  Some digital recordings will be made for analysis of
              phonetic structures of interest.  The value of preserving endangered languages
              such as Deg Xinag is twofold.  First, the information preserved is a valuable
              record of the culture, of interest to future members of the communities. 
              Second, such information is needed to construct valid theories of human
              linguistic diversity.
