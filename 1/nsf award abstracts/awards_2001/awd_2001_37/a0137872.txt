Abstract    :
              "Active Chemistry" is a modular, one year, stand-alone, inquiry-based, secondary
              school chemistry course.  It is modeled in design and pedagogical strategies on
              "Active Physics" and is meant to follow it or to be used in conjunction with it
              to become a physical science course.  "Active Chemistry" is aligned with the
              National Science Education Standards and State Frameworks that directs all
              students, grades 9-12, to learn the science necessary to solve real-world
              problems.  The four chapters on Sports Science and Health, Environmental
              Issues, Entertainment, and Energy contain three modules.  Each module includes
              a chapter challenge, a scenario, activities, and a final project assignment. 
              Students work together in groups to acquire the knowledge needed to address the
              challenge.  Chemical concepts are introduced on a need to know basis and topics
              reappear in various chapters providing multiple exposures in different
              contexts.  The teacher resources provide a scope and sequence presented in
              matrix format with unifying and fundamental concepts identified, suggested
              instructional strategies and techniques, and other resources including
              precautions on safety issues, equipment lists and assessment tools.  A
              professional development video for one chapter is provided.
