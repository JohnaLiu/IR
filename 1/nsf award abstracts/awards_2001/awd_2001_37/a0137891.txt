Abstract    :
              This project addresses the input of nutrients (specifically, iron) to the oceans
              from atmospheric transport of dust, and the production of sulfur containing
              gaseous species (such as DMS, dimethyl sulfide) by the ocean organisms as a
              result. Increased production of DMS leads to increased atmospheric particle
              formation which in turn can affect climate. The principal investigator will
              participate in a research cruise where she will sample atmospheric particulates
              and analyze them for their trace metal content (including Fe(II)), and measure
              the gas-phase concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2), the atmospheric
              particulate concentrations of sulfate, and methane sulfonic acid (MSA), all
              oxidation product of DMS. She will also carry out photochemical leaching
              experiments which will simulate the interaction between atmospheric aerosols
              and ocean water.

This project, supported under the ADVANCE program, will
              launch the independent career of a female scientist. It will expose
              undergraduate students to research at the interface of atmospheric chemistry
              and oceanography, and will improve our understanding of the role of atmospheric
              aerosols in enhancing ocean productivity.
