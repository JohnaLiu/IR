Abstract    :
              Professor Joel Harris of the University of Utah is funded by the Analytical and
              Surface Chemistry Program to study single molecule fluorescence imaging and
              optical trapping techniques for the study of colloids and colloid-derived
              materials (e.g. silica).  Single molecule fluorescence imaging spectroscopy
              will be used to determine distributions of dye labels, to count reactive
              surface sites, and to determine particle volume and areas.  Optical trapping
              will provide long residence times to observe Raman scattering and determine
              chemical composition of individual particles and kinetics of surface reactions.
               

A wide variety of chemical materials and industrial processes depend on
              the dispersion of finely divided solid materials in liquids, and probing the
              chemistry of these particles is a challenge for chemical analysis.   The
              combination of single molecule spectroscopy and optical trapping is being used
              by others, especially in biological chemistry, but the proposal to use these on
              colloidal particles is unique.
