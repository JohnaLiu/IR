Abstract    :
              This grant by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              supports work by Professor Reuben H. Simoyi at West Virginia University to
              investigate the reaction mechanisms of small organic sulfur compounds.  Focus
              areas are: S-oxygenation, enzymatic and nonenzymatic metabolic activation,
              radical species, decomposition and autoxidation reactions, and toxicity
              effects.  These areas of investigation relate to important physiological,
              environmental and industrial processes involving oxidation, C-S bond cleavage
              and radical intermediates.

Reactions of sulfur compounds will be studied,
              particularly with regard to their utility in understanding sulfur reactivities
              in physiological, environmental and industrial processes.
