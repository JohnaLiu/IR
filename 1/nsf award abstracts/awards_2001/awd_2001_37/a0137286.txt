Abstract    :
              The study will focus on an important problem concerning the oceanic crustal
              structure, i.e., the extent to which seismic boundaries within the crust
              correlate with geological boundaries.  It aims to link the seismic structure of
              upper oceanic crust with the known geology of the crust exposed at Hess Deep
              and the Blanco Transform areas.  The PIs hope that the experiment will clarify
              the relationship between the seismic boundaries and the geologic units of
              oceanic crust.  Two separate cruises will be undertaken to conduct refraction
              profiling with wide-angle MCS lines allowing high-resolution imgaging of the
              uppermost crust.
