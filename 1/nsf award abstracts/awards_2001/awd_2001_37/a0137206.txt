Abstract    :
              This is an investigation of the recently discovered Lost City Vent Field, atop
              the dome-like Atlantis Massif at 30 degrees north on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. 
              This field is different from all other known seafloor hydrothermal fields in
              that it is located on 1.5 Ma crust, is dominated by steep-sided carbonate
              chimneys, and is underlain by significiant exposures of serpentinized
              peridotite.  A detailed mapping and sampling program will be conducted to
              address the following:  the tectonic and geologic controls that focus venting,
              the chemical and isotopic compositions of the vent structures and fluids, the
              indicence and phylogentic diversity of microorganisms, and whether macrofauna
              exist.
