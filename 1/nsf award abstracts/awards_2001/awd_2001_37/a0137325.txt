Abstract    :
              The PIs will measure Uranium series isotopes (230Th/238U, 226Ra/230Th,
              231Pa/235U) in order to place constraints on the eruption ages of axial and
              off-axis lava flows in the 9-10N area of the East Pacific Rise (EPR), which has
              been well mapped and intensively studied with Alvin for the last decade.  These
              U-series dates, together with new data on Sr, Nd, Pb, and Hf isotopes will be
              used to evaluate the petrogenesis of the samples and to evaluate the extent of
              near off-axis vs. axial additions to the ocean crust in this area, which
              seismic studies indicate should be an important process (off0axis thickening of
              lawer 2A).  The samples will be "selected" by a "randomizing" process in order
              to determine theproportion of the crust that is added off-axis.
