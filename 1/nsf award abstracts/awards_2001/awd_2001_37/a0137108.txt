Abstract    :
              In this proposed study the PIs will investigate the interaction between
              channelized and porous flow of melt in the mantle and chemical heterogeneities
              that might be present at various length scales. Using theoretical models
              constrained by geologic and petrologic observations, they will examine the
              basic behavior of systems undergoing melting and their predictions. The
              research will primarily be undertaken by a graduate student, with close
              supervision by the PIs in a staged manner, progressing from simple to more
              complex (realistic) models. It is expected that the new models can be used to
              test emerging ideas and observations of chemical heterogeneity in melts and
              mantle residues in a variety of melting regimes (ridges, arc, plumes).
