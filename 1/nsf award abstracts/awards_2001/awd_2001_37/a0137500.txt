Abstract    :
              The impact of a data-validated radiation model RRTM, on multi-year climate
              simulations will be examined under this research effort. Previous work has
              shown that the improved accuracy provided by the RRTM in the longwave modifies
              the temperature structure, water vapor distribution, and tropical circulation
              in the CCM3 simulations. However comparisons between the RRTM and CCM3 in the
              shortwave show substantial clear sky differences that complicate the
              interpretation of the RRTM longwave impact on CCM3 in some regions. Experiments
              proposed here will consider the effect of both longwave and shortwave
              improvements. In addition, by comparing RRTM-modeled and observed spectral
              radiances, there are substantial discrepancies in the ability of the CCM3 to
              simulate upper tropospheric water vapor that appear unrelated to radiation. The
              collaboration with MIT (PI Emanuel) will examine the role of convection in this
              process.
