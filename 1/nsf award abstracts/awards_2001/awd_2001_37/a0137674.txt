Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is the development of a student-accessible
              sounding rocket program for the study of the Earth's ionosphere.  The goal of
              ADVANCE is to increase representation of women in science and engineering, and
              this award would greatly advance such efforts to develop an externally-funded
              independent research program.  The goal of this project is development of
              sounding rocket projects to explore various ionospheric phenomena, including
              plasma-neutral coupling, dusty plasmas, chemical-induced artificial aurora and
              ionospheric heating experiments.
