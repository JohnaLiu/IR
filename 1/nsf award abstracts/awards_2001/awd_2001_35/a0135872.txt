Abstract    :
              Plant productivity is limited by water and phosphorus availability in natural
              and agricultural ecosystems throughout the world. Root system architecture
              plays an important role in the acquisition of scarce soil resources.  Using
              common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) as a model system, we have identified
              specific root architectural traits that are regulated by genetic and
              environmental factors, particularly phosphorus availability. We have also
              demonstrated that these root traits are related to plant adaptation to
              different environments.  In addition, we have developed Recombinant Inbred
              Lines of beans that segregate for these traits, which we will employ in our
              studies.
Experiments outlined in this proposal aim to gain a better
              understanding of the relationship between root architecture and resource
              acquisition, particularly when multiple soil resources are limiting.  Our
              overall objectives are to examine the tradeoffs of a shallow vs. deep root
              architecture for water and phosphorus acquisition, as well as to determine the
              adaptive importance of root architectural plasticity and the potential
              implications for interplant competition.  The results from this work will have
              important ecological and agricultural significance, as well as aid in the
              development of resource acquisition efficient crops.
