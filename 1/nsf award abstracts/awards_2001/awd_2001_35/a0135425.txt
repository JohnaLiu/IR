Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project investigates experiences regarding pregnancy
              and reproduction in two of the most populous, and markedly different, groups of
              migrant workers currently working in Tel Aviv, Israel: Nigerian and Filipina
              women.  Given Israel's nationalist ideal of an ethno-religious Jewish majority,
              non-Jewish migrants' reproduction is perceived as an unbearable economic burden
              and a threat to Israeli national integrity.  In this ethnographic context, this
              study--conducted in affiliation with the Physicians for Human Rights Open
              Clinic and the municipal Mesila Aid and Information Center--investigates
              individual women's experiences of pregnancy and parenthood through
              semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and life history
              interviews.  Findings will be anchored in a broader exploration of the
              microsocial, sociocultural, and political economic contexts of migrant women's
              lives in a foreign, and often unwelcoming, host society.  This study broadens
              the global discussions regarding transnational labor migration through
              ethnographic and theoretical elaboration of migrant women's experiences of
              biological reproduction, and the dynamic interrelationship among nationalist
              sentiment, demographic speculation, administrative policies and constraints,
              and transnational labor migration flows.
