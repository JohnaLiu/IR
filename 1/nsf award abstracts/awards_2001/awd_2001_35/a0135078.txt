Title: CAREER: Singularities and
              Microstructure - Multiple Scale Analysis for Nonlinear PDE, Geometric Problems,
              and the Physical Sciences

There exist a variety of tools for studying
              multiple scale behaviors
in nonlinear systems, and the method of choice for a
              particular
problem often depends on whether the investigator is an analyst,
              an
applied mathematician or a physicist. An important goal is to
effectively
              merge the various approaches, and develop new ways of
thinking about
              multi-scale problems. To this end, this project focuses
on investigating five
              interdisciplinary problems, using ideas from
functional analysis, geometry,
              topology, matched asymptotics and
scaling arguments, in conjunction with
              numerical simulations. These
problems are (1) Generalized crumpling: Combining
              functional analytic
methods with geometric/topological ideas to study
              singularities and
microstructure; (2) Blowup in Parabolic PDEs: Applying Morse
              theory to
the dynamics of blowup solutions; (3) Dynamics of
              microstructure:
Studying global bifurcations involving the change of
              microstructure in
a model system; (4) Pattern formation and non-equilibrium
              phase
transitions: Investigating multiple scale behaviors in
              nonlinear
systems in the presence of noise; and (5) Topological transitions
              in
fluid interfaces: Using tools from PDE to investigate
              topological
transitions in 2 fluid systems.

Many real world systems are
              interesting precisely because they exhibit
different behaviors on different
              scales. This is certainly true for
living organisms, geological and
              geophysical systems, technologically
important composite materials and even
              social structures and
hierarchies. Thus researchers across many disciplines
              grapple with the
following two questions, which are the essence of multiple
              scale
analysis: (1) How does the large scale (macroscopic) behavior
              emerge
out of the collective behavior of the small scale
              (microscopic)
units?, and (2) What are the rules governing the large scale
              behavior,
and how does this influence the behavior of the small scale units?
              The
research component of this project studies these questions in
              a
mathematical setting through problems that arise in material science
and in
              physics. The overall goal is to meld together a variety of
techniques to
              develop tools that can successfully handle complex
real-world multiple scale
              problems. This is combined with an
integrated approach to pedagogy, that
              features a strong involvement in
undergraduate and graduate research,
              development of research
opportunities for groups that are under-represented in
              mathematics and
the physical sciences, curriculum development both at the
              graduate and
the undergraduate level, and development of materials for
              scientific
outreach to the general public.
