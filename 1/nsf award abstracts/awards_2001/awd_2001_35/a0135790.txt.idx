Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to explore the use of the nonlinear
              optical technique of second-harmonic generation (SHG) for developing a
              sub-surface imaging approach that is capable of non-destructive detection and
              evaluation of corrosion and cracking of painted metals and composite layered
              materials.  The experimental arrangement will make use of femtosecond light
              pulses in the 800-2000 nm spectral range from a Ti:sapphire laser and amplifier
              system and an optical parametric amplifier pumped by it for second harmonic
              generation.  The laser beam will be focused onto a spot in the sample; SHG
              signal will be collected in back-propagation geometry, sensed by a
              phase-sensitive detector, and recorded by a computer.  A two-dimensional (2-D)
              x-y image for a particular depth (z) will be generated point-by-point by raster
              scanning the incident laser beam, collecting the SHG signal, and plotting the
              normalized signal as a function of position in the x-y plane.   Different
              depths (z) within the sample will be accessed by adjusting the z-position of
              the focal spot.  A series of 2-D x-y scans for different z-values will provide
              the 3-D sub-surface tomographic images of the sample.  The samples to be
              investigated include rivets, semiconductor and dielectric wafers, painted
              quartz plates, corroded or/and scratched metal plates, as well as aged metal
              specimens from airplane wing, bridge, and other structures.  Significance of
              the proposed approach are: ability to obtain 3-D images up to a depth of ~500
              mm, higher spatial resolution of ~20 mm, and potential for estimation of
              metallic corrosion rate from corrosion thickness measurements.  The project
              will have an impact on sensing of cracks, corrosion, and defects in civil,
              mechanical, electrical, and optical material systems, and integration of
              research and education activities in an academic institution serving the
              disadvantaged minorities and newcomers to the mainstream of American
              society.
