Abstract    :
              Professor Jennifer Shepherd, of the Department of Chemistry at Gonzaga
              University, is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              for her research that involves the elucidation of rhodoquinone (RQ)
              biosynthesis in the purple non-sulfur bacteria, Rhodospirillum rubrum and later
              in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. RQ is an essential electron carrier in
              the anaerobic energy metabolism of both of these species as well as in the
              helminth parasites. Parasitic infections pose a serious health threat to both
              humans and domestic animals. There are few effective anthelminthic agents
              available due to the emergence resistant parasite strains. The Pl plans to
              develop new anthelminthic agents that selectively target RQ biosynthesis in
              parasites.

The teaching portion of this proposal focuses utilizing
              undergraduates and postdoctoral students in teaching and research. Therefore,
              with the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
              Jennifer Shepherd, of the Department of Chemistry at Gonzaga will use small
              projects within the specific aims of the research project to train
              undergraduates and larger scope projects for post doctoral associates.
