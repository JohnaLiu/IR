Abstract    :
              This research project, to be conducted by a doctoral student in Anthropology at
              the University of Georgia, contributes to an understanding of some of the
              processes of knowledge acquisition and transfer in formal and informal social
              contexts. Plant knowledge diversity and consensus are hypothesized to be
              correlated with variation in the structure of communication networks and
              community interaction patterns. Qualitative and quantitative techniques are
              used to test these hypotheses and document variation in ethnobotanical
              knowledge and change in several Raramuri (Tarahumara) communities in Chihuahua,
              Mexico. The project identifies environmental factors contributing to
              differential botanical expertise among children and adults at three levels of
              interaction: 1) the social interaction patterns between households; 2) a
              child's immediate environment interactions, both biophysical and sociocultural;
              and 3) a child's personal characteristics and social roles. Results will
              contribute to the development of an interactionist model of indigenous
              education, and to understanding the relationships between individual learning
              and community processes of change. It will also contribute to ongoing Raramuri
              biocultural conservation efforts and to the design of effective environmental
              education projects.
