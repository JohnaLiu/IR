Abstract    :
              
The focus of this workshop is to define the fundamental technical issues
              critical for the development of low-temperature fuel cells.  The workshop is
              scheduled to take place during November, 2001 at the National Science
              Foundation.  The collective expertise of the group will identify feasible
              approaches to improved understanding and to establish an agenda for basic
              engineering research that will address these needs.  The fuel-cell industry may
              have a significant impact on the consumer market in the future, playing a role
              wherever electrical power is needed.  Although theoretically capable of high
              efficiency, the catalyst and transport processes limit actual performance. 
              Engineering challenges of integrating and controlling the fuel-cell system
              (fuel processor, fuel cell, and power conditioning) must be overcome,
              especially for transient operation.  Areas to be addressed include electrodes,
              membranes, fuel storage and conversion, and modeling.  The basic sciences that
              support fuel-cell development are varied and require an interdisciplinary
              approach.  Fuel cells have the potential to provide a clean source of
              electrical power for household, industrial, and transportation applications.  A
              report defining the fundamental scientific and engineering issues along with
              research approaches will be prepared.
