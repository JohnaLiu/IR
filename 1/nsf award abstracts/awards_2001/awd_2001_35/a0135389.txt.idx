Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a young investigator and her students who are
              working on a series of projects related to the experimental effort to detect
              gravitational waves with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
              Observatory (LIGO).  The proposed activities include;  experimental studies of
               vibration isolation systems needed to enable LIGO to reach its ultimate
              sensitivity goal for terrestrial based detectors;    development of new
              optical sensors needed in feedback systems to control the large LIGO optics and
              thereby "lock" the interferometer arms in the presence of background motion;
               development of new diagnostic techniques to measure and evaluate earth-motion
              that produces gravitational gradients that may limit the sensitivity of
              advanced detectors;  development  of analysis techniques to extract
              gravitational wave signals from the LIGO data stream in the presence of
              background noise.  The PI is a leader in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration
              group that is charged with analyzing LIGO data for evidence of "burst" sources
              of gravitational waves and setting upper limits on amplitude and rates of such
              signals.
