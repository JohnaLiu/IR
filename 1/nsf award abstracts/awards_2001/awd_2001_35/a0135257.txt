TITLE: Completion of Computing History
              Memoir


The investigator has published two editions of an
              autobiography/history intended to cover the early years of the computer
              revolution. The first edition, in hardcover, called COMPUTER [see B. in
              Biographical Sketch], ran through mid-1959 and ended with his first departure
              from IBM. The second edition, on CD/ROM, was produced under NSF auspices (Grant
              No. CDA-9622944) and also covered the subsequent years through mid-1967, when
              the investigator was drafted to re-launch the Center for Computer Sciences and
              Technology at the National Bureau of Standards now NIST. The material added to
              the second edition was primarily concerned with the international computer
              scene, and included a visit to Japan in 1960 and two long tours of European
              user installations and European manufacturers on behalf of the young Control
              Data Corporation, in 1962. On the domestic side, the second edition ended with
              the investigator's direction of an Air Force-funded research project in
              computational linguistics for GE Santa Barbara.
It is proposed to carry the
              memoir through six years at NBS, three as director of CCST and three as Senior
              Research Fellow after IBM requested his removal from the earlier post for
              halting all Federal procurement of the new System/3 (which was withdrawn some
              years later). The investigator emerged to become the first editorial director
              of the burgeoning newspaper COMPUTERWORLD, which was to be the foundation of
              the McGovern IDG empire.
