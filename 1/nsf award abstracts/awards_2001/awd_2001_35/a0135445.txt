Philosophical Significance of
              Symmetries in Mechanics
Gordon Belot, New York University

This philosophy
              of physics project studies from a unified perspective three prominent problems
              in philosophy of physics-the question of relationalism about space and motion,
              the question of the nature and significance of gauge freedom, and the question
              of the content and implications of the principle of general covariance. The
              author intends, by setting these questions in the context of the mathematical
              theory of symmetry and reduction within geometric mechanics, to make possible
              sharp construals and investigations of conceptual and interpretative questions.
               He also hopes that treating these questions together within single framework
              allows for a fruitful delineation of the analogies and disanalogies in play at
              the technical level, as an aid towards making progress at the interpretative
              level. The intended result of the project is a book treating these topics.
