Abstract    :
              Visual search is a process that humans engage in on a daily basis.  Looking for
              a friend in a crowd, a car in a parking lot, or a tumor in an x-ray mammogram
              are all examples of visual search.  Visual search involves two processes, (1)
              scrutinizing the visual scene by making eye movements to orient the
              high-resolution fovea to the regions of interest and (2) attending to different
              points in the visual scene independent of the eye position to select relevant
              visual information.  For over three decades, investigators have studied visual
              attention and offered different theories about its function and its processing
              limitations during search.  This research will test a number of existing and
              newly proposed theories using novel mathematical/computer implementations of
              models of visual attention.  The results will allow for a better understanding
              of the function of visual attention during visual search.  The research will
              also provide a new theoretical and quantitative framework to study the types of
              attentional disorders present in patients with schizophrenia, Alzheimer's
              disease, attentional deficit/hyperactive disorders, and hemi-neglect.  The
              education plan will incorporate the use of computer and mathematical models in
              the study of visual attention in undergraduate and graduate education.  In
              addition, the education plan will include implementation of a website that will
              allow students and researchers worldwide Internet access to use and test
              computer models of visual attention.
