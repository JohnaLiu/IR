Abstract    :
              Professor Luis Echegoyen of Clemson University is supported by the Analytical
              and Surface Chemistry Program to study the electrochemistry of fullerene
              compounds.  Within this theme, there are four areas proposed:  reactivity of
              electrochemically induced reactions, including photovoltaic applications,
              preparation of new crystalline materials and metal ion endohedral complexes.  
              The reaction mechanism to be studied is the removal of certain cyclopropane
              adducts from methanofullerenes.  

The field of fullerene chemistry including
              electrochemical study has grown since the discovery of this new carbon form
              just over a decade ago.  New materials with potential for energy storage and
              sensors are beginning to emerge from this research endeavor.
