Abstract    :
              It is generally held that proteins and nucleic acids are the two principle
              classes of naturally occurring biomolecules capable of acting as enzymes in
              living systems.  However, it has also been demonstrated that some cyclic
              oligosaccharides can act as catalysts in very simple non-biological in vitro
              systems.  The goal of this project is to expand upon these observations. 
              Specifically, this project seeks to demonstrate that cyclic oligosaccharides
              (in some organisms under certain circumstances) may not only act as catalysts
              in biological systems, but also, as a direct consequence of their enzyme-like
              activities, play important and unexpected physiological roles for the organisms
              that synthesize them.  The observation that naturally occurring
              oligosaccharides possess catalytic activities in biological circumstances may
              have broad and profound implications for our current understanding of
              biological chemistry, cellular enzymology, and evolutionary biology.  Moreover,
              they may enable the design and exploitation of directed evolutionary or other
              schemes to generate families of oligo- and polysaccharide catalysts with novel
              and useful properties.
