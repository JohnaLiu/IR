This award supports the participation of American
              scientists in a U.S.-Japan seminar on seismic disaster mitigation in urban
              areas by geotechnical engineering to be held in Anchorage, Alaska from May
              21-22, 2002.  The co-organizers are Professor Ross Boulanger of the University
              of California, Davis and Professor Ikuo Towhata at the University of Tokyo in
              Japan.  Earthquakes can devastate major urban areas in a number of ways,
              including through the hazards posed to the population, the disruption of
              lifeline systems and services, and the economic impacts on the region, state,
              or nation.  Advances in our understanding of seismic hazards and their
              mitigation continue to be learned from recent large earthquakes.  Recently the
              1999 Chi-Chi (Taiwan), 1999 Kocaeli (Turkey), and 2000 Bhuj earthquakes caused
              tremendous damage to the civil infrastructure in and around urban areas in
              those countries.  Reconnaissance teams sent independently from the U.S. and
              Japan investigated these disasters.  Geotechnical aspects of these disasters
              will be discussed, including the effects of liquefaction, ground deformations,
              foundation failures, landslides, and surface ruptures on civil infrastructure
              (e.g., lifelines, ports and harbors, buildings, transportation systems).  The
              objective of the seminar is to facilitate advancement of our understanding and
              ability to mitigate geotechnical aspects of seismic disasters.  Discussions on
              these subjects will include: 1) development of new engineering techniques for
              mitigation of these hazards; 2) identification of those problems that should be
              solved with the highest priority; and 3) sharing the most recent results of
              research to advance our understanding of, and ability to predict, these types
              of hazards and effectively plan mitigation efforts.

A number of researchers
              in both countries will continue to more thoroughly investigate important sites
              for lessons that can advance our understanding of these hazards. The project
              advances international human resources through the participation of postdocs
              and a graduate student.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this
              project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international
              understanding and cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish results of the
              seminar proceedings on their web site at the Center for Geotechnical Modeling
              (http://cgm.engr.ucdavis.edu/).
