Abstract

It is proposed to explore modeling and control of
              multi-source wind/photovoltaic (PV)/fuel cell distributed generation systems to
              evaluate and improve their performance.  Proper dynamic models of different
              generation devices (i.e., wind generator, PV arrays, storage batteries and fuel
              cells) involved will be developed.  Special attention will be put on studying
              the electrical characteristics of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells for
              applications such as electric motor starting, load switching and/or rejection
              to explore their dynamic behavior and design controllers to enhance their
              response and efficiency.

Dynamic model of different generation devices will
              be integrated to form a multi-sourced distributed generation model whose
              dynamic performance will also be explored.  Based on this dynamic response, a
              transient classifier will be designed to manage power flows from different
              generation sources with the objective of increasing the overall system
              efficiency and reliability.

Economic benefits of both single-source and
              multi-source systems will also be evaluated.
