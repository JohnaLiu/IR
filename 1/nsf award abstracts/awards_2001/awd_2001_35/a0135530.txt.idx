Abstract    :
                    We propose to hold a two-day workshop in Tucson, Arizona during fall 2001
              on emerging ultra-large networks, such as the Internet. Hosted by Arizona
              Center for Integrative Modeling and Simulation, the meeting will bring
              together some of the world's leading researchers in the networking area to meet
              with counterparts with expertise in modeling and simulation of networks and of
              systems more generally. The workshop will provide these researchers with the
              task of coming up with the unknowns of ultra-large networks and with new
              directions of research in modeling and simulation that can address these
              unknowns.       The Internet is increasing in connectivity, toward 1 billion
              nodes in 2005 and node capability providing a highly interconnected and
              computationally powerful medium. Such a globally and ubiquitously
              dispersed network will provide a new frontier for new kinds of educational,
              commerce and entertainment activities. However, there are many issues that
              arise in the emergence of such a large, highly decentralized, collection of
              interaction parts. The increased connectivity and capability creates new
              complexity and dynamics that we are only on the verge of appreciating.
              Difficulties in dealing with large-scale software systems are well documented
              in a recent report by the National Research Council. Techniques that work for
              small software systems fail markedly when the scale is increased by one
              million fold. Computer-based modeling and simulation (M&S) methodology is
              required to address these issues since the scale is well beyond
              what analytical tools alone can handle and there is limited ability to do
              controlled experiments on the always on Internet. Traditional M&S approaches
              have focussed on the micro-level components rather than the macro level
              integration of these components. However, with the advent of ultra-large scale
              systems such as the Internet of the future, it is necessary to develop M&S
              approaches for understanding the behaviors of very large inter-connected
              networks with very few loci of control and many interacting and varied
              sources of input and services demand.       The results of this workshop are
              expected to be a set of specific finding of gaps in our knowledge of
              the behavior of ultra-large networks and how to deal with their design,
              management, and control. Participants may assess whether current approaches
              can be evolved to deal with the large increases in scale or whether different,
              revolutionary paradigms are required. Participants will address the need for
              new techniques and approaches for building models of ultra-large networks and
              developing simulation environments for studying their behaviors. Suggestions
              for borrowing points of view form other areas such as complex adaptive systems
              and from basic theory of modeling and simulation will be encouraged. The
              proceedings will be compiled in a form that will provide a useable and
              significant guide for new NSF funding initiatives for future network
              infrastructure research.
