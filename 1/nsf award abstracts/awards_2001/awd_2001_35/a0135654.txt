This grant provides partial support for the acquisition of a
              cluster of networked PCs (Beowulf cluster) dedicated to the prediction of the
              properties of ore forming fluids and aluminosilicate melts.  Additional support
              will cover the salary of a postdoctoral scholar who will develop an interactive
              web site and necessary software to allow collaborators in the geosciences to
              initiate, view and control ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations of
              the chemical properties of hydrothermal fluids and the structure and dynamics
              of molten aluminosilicates over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. 
              AIMD simulations facilitated on this multi-CPU Beowulf cluster will support and
              enhance experimental spectroscopic investigations of the chemical structure and
              dynamics of hydrothermal fluids and silicate melts and should offer new
              insights into the behavior of these fluids in a P-T range largely inaccessible
              to experimentation.
