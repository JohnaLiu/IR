This project supports a small interdisciplinary workshop
              entitled "Scientific Pluralism" at the University of Minnesota, October 10 -
              13, 2002.  The Principal Investigators are bringing together leading
              philosophers of science and scientists who have independently advanced views
              consistent with the idea that some natural phenomena cannot be fully explained
              by a single theory or fully investigated using a single approach. The aim of
              the workshop is to develop an understanding of the various forms of pluralism
              being advanced and to explore their philosophical implications. The goal is to
              determine whether a consistent philosophical account of scientific pluralism
              can be developed that goes beyond the mere rejection of the unity of science
              doctrine. This workshop brings together philosophers who have advanced
              pluralist solutions to puzzles encountered in their analysis of science with
              practicing scientists.   The philosophers and scientists participating in the
              meeting represent a broad range of sciences including physics and mathematics,
              biology, and social and behavioral science.  Philosophical participants are
              focusing their research and workshop presentations on detailed case studies
              that warrant pluralist interpretations.  Workshop discussion includes
              scientists' commentaries on the detailed case studies and general discussions
              on the broad philosophical implications of the presented works.  The Principal
              Investigators plan to publish results of the workshop in a volume of "Minnesota
              Studies in Philosophy of Science."
