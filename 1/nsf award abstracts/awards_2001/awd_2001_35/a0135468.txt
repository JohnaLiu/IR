Abstract    :
              The project is to measure the force and deformation of individual floc of
              particles using a specially designed piston-cylinder apparatus.  The relations
              between the applied compressive force and the floc porosity and structure will
              be determined. The effects of process variables on the structural
              characteristics will be assessed. The results will be used to develop a theory
              for the uniaxial compression based on the percolation theory with the moving
              boundary of the cylinder.
