Abstract    :
                 Nerve cells (neurons) in the mammalian brain often have elaborate treelike
              branching of fine cellular extensions called dendritic arbors, which receive
              the chemical signals of activity from other neurons.  Like an antenna, the
              location and number of branches on a dendritic arbor organize the pattern of
              the afferent input, so the decision about where and when to form a branch is
              critical.  The intracellular structures of these dendrites include cytoskeletal
              components called actin and microtubules, and these components are dynamic,
              changing the dendritic structure over time by elongation or retraction or
              stabilization of the branches at particular points.  It remains unclear what
              the mechanisms are that determine the patterning of these often highly specific
              arbors during development and growth.  To approach this question, this project
              combines several recent technical advances that give the ability to 1)
              accelerate dendritic development significantly in cultured neurons from the
              hippocampal region of the brain; 2) follow the expression and trafficking of
              proteins and organelles within the living neuron by high-resolution microscopic
              time-lapse imaging; and 3) to create patterned substrates, using novel creative
              nanofabrication techniques to provide external cues for cellular development. 
              The experiments will determine the roles of actin and microtubule dynamics, and
              the influence of external cues such as cell adhesion molecules and location of
              afferent contacts from other neurons, on dendritic branching.
   Results will
              provide a major advance on an important topic of neural development where
              fundamental information is still unknown, and the interdisciplinary approach
              will enhance interactions between biology and engineering.  The excellent
              integration of educational activities with the research will have a major
              impact on research experience in this liberal arts college, and even on the
              local public schools.
