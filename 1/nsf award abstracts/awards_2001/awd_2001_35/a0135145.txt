Abstract    :
              This project conducted by the Southwest Center for Educational Excellence will
              work with ten districts to implement systemic reform strategies through
              content-based professional development, action research, standards-based
              curricula, reallocation of resources, formulation of supportive policies, and
              development of local partnerships.  Four catalyst schools will partner with
              smaller districts, and key staff work will be organized by the schools'
              five-year improvement plans.
