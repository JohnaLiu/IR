Abstract    :
              Modeling of the fast solar wind and streamers will be carried out based on a
              pair of interlaced computer codes. One will be a 3D three-fluid code
              encompassing electrons, protons and one species of heavy ion. The other is a
              kinetic hybrid code where the protons and heavy ions are treated as particles
              and the electrons as a fluid. The hybrid code will be used to study the effect
              of high-frequency kinetic Alfven waves on the distribution functions, and in
              particular to determine the damping of these waves and their heating of the
              plasma. The results will be incorporated in the fluid simulation, and the
              results compared with observations, like ion flow speeds and effective
              temperature, derived from instruments on board SOHO and TRACE.
