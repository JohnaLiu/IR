Abstract    :
              	This proposal seeks funding for a workshop to bring together some 20 leading
              scholars and industry leaders to discuss needed research and theory development
              ininnovation and organization change. Organized by the editors of Organization
              Science, a leading journal of organization studies, workshop participants will
              collaborate to write white papers to set a research agenda for organization
              studies and management for the coming years. Currently managers face enormously
              changed circumstances from those of most of the last century, during which much
              organization theory was generated. The accumulated changes in the nature of
              work, organixations, and the external environment, including science and
              technology, cry out urgently for new theory based on sound empirical work. The
              workshop will be convened at NSF in Arlington in June 2002, with knowledge
              dissemination via the web, a sepcial issue of the journal Organization Science,
              and a research monograph to be published (tentatively) by Stanford University
              Press.
