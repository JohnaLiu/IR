Abstract    :
              
The proposers will catalog and analyze classroom barriers-attitudes, concepts,
              skills, instructional strategies-that prevent students' egress to higher level
              mathematics classes, and to study and compare parental attitudes and
              interventions between majority and minority parents toward their children's
              course-taking habits and decisions.  The mathematics specialists involved in
              the exploratory phase of the work will compile school-specific and network
              composite lists of barrier concepts, and will then develop a set of
              instructional strategies and resources to redress the barriers.  Minority and
              majority parents of students in grades 5-7 will be interviewed as to their
              understanding of the role of higher level coursework, and access to such
              courses; the effectiveness of district communications; their understanding of
              district policies; and their relationship with schools.
