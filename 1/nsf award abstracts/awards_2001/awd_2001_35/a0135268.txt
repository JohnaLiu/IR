Abstract    :
              Three lipid-associated supramolecular preparations of the membrane-active
              antibiotic Amphotericin B (AmB) are currently on the market: AmBisome,
              Amphocil, and Abelcet. They are fundamentally different physically: AmBisome is
              a true closed liposomal bilayer preparation, Amphocil is micellar dispersion
              with cholesteryl sulfate and Abelcet is interdigitated lipid dispersion.
              Despite these differences, all three preparations damage fungal membranes
              compared to mammalian cell and all are more active than the original micellar
              commercial preparation consisting of AmB: deoxycholate in a mole ratio of ~1:2
              (Fungizone, FZ). Simple AmB or FZ solutions may be treated with moderate heat
              (70 o C for 20 minutes) to produce a new self-associated state of AmB, a
              imsuperaggregatel., termed heat-treated Fungizone (HFZ). The goal of this
              project is to tease apart which specificbiochemical and biophysical properties
              of these five Amphotericin B supramolecular preparations make them selectively
              reactive toward fungal versus mammalian cell membranes. Three factors which
              influence the toxicity and selectivity of AmB preparations will be investigated
              by spectroscopic and molecular biology methods: 1) direct membrane activity via
              ion channel formation, 2) differences in distribution and delivery to tissues
              due to differences in stability of AmB complexes in the presence of serum
              lipoproteins/proteins, and 3) initiation of an inflammatory cytokine
              response.
