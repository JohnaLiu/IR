Abstract    :
              
This three-year continuation of assessing the ATE Program will address four
              major questions: 1) To what degree is the program achieving its goals?  2) Is
              it making an impact, reaching the individuals and groups intended? 3) How
              effective is it when it reaches it constituents? 4) Are there ways the program
              can be significantly improved?

The project will be comprised of three
              components. The first is the continuing collection and reporting of monitoring
              information for the ATE program through a database this project developed. 
              Second is the design and implementation of four studies examining critical
              issues for ATE: the value added by ATE as determined by business and industry,
              the quality of materials development and their impact, the quality of
              professional development, and the nature and extent of sustainability of ATE
              project.  The third component is dissemination of the evaluation project's
              findings through traditional and innovative approaches.
