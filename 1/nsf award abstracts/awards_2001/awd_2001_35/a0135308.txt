Mathematical Sciences: Vertical Integration

The VIGRE program of the Department
              of Mathematics at the Ohio State University is designed to benefit the
              mathematical sciences by bringing together working groups consisting of
              undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty. 
              The program will implement strategies for introducing both graduate students
              and undergraduate students to the research environment at a much earlier stage
              than usual and acquainting them with a greater number of faculty.   It will
              increase the interactions between graduate and undergraduate students,
              postdoctoral fellows, junior faculty, and senior faculty.  

First-year
              graduate students will take a course, Invitation to Research, consisting of a
              number of short lecture series, taught by many different faculty, providing a
              glimpse into the various areas of mathematics in an informal setting. 
              Beginning in their second year, students will be involved in Working Group
              Rotations that acquaint them with different areas of mathematics, different
              research styles, and different faculty throughout the year. The graduate
              students' professional development is rounded out with courses that train them
              in effective communication of mathematics.  These initiatives will enhance the
              effectiveness of the graduate program, lessen the time students require to
              obtain a Ph.D., and improve their employment opportunities in academia and in
              industry.

Postdoctoral fellows will participate in the full spectrum of
              VIGRE activities.  Undergraduate students will be involved in working group
              activities, in the Ross Summer Mathematics Program for high school students and
              teachers, and in a National Undergraduate Mathematics Research Conference that
              will be sponsored by Ohio State University.
