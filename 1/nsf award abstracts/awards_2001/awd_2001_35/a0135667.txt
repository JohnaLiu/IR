Abstract    :
              The investigators will continue scientific studies of the magnetosphere with
              detailed data analysis of multi-point observations.  The effort will take
              advantage of the unprecedented coverage provided by ground-based observatories
              and satellites launched as part of NASA's International Solar Terrestrial
              Physics Program.  Specific goals are to study the pressure distribution in the
              magnetosphere, to assess the accuracy of global models, and to demonstrate
              techniques for assimilation of data.  The work includes examining plasma
              pressure distributions during storms and substorms and comparing the pressure
              values with those inferred from low-altitude Defense Meteorological Satellite
              Program satellites.  The results will help develop a reliable model for
              pressure in the magnetosphere and pave the way for data assimilation in future
              space weather models.
