The computer g aphics community
              increasingly recognizes the importance of understanding and leveraging the
              human pe ceptual system.Indeed,several researchers have proposed techniques to
              accelerate rendering by exploiting the limitations of human vision. 
              However,this research has focused on realistic rendering algorithms such as ray
              and path tracing, which take seconds or minutes to render.Ve y little work has
              been done on perceptually d iven interactive rendering,whe e each image must be
              completed in milliseconds.Yet a dire need exists for techniques to accelerate
              interactive rendering of ever-la ger datasets,fo despite
tremendous strides in
              graphics hardware,the growth in complexity of 3-D models appears to
              be
outstripping our ability to render them.
One barrier to research on
              perceptually motivated interactive rendering acceleration methods has been the
              inflexibility of standard graphics hardware.The rendering pipeline, specialized
              and perfected over many yea s,is now extremely fast at a narrow set of
              rendering tasks,but researchers cannot tamper with the traditional
              polygon-rendering underpinnings.  We propose to circumvent this barrier by
              using software rendering,distributed across a cluster to achieve interactive
              ates on complex scenes.This SGER focuses on building the equipment necessa y to
              analyze several perceptual rendering techniques impossible under the
              traditional polygon-oriented interactive rendering paradigm.
