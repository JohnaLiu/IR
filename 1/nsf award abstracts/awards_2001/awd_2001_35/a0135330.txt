Abstract    :
              This research will investigate protein dynamics in detail in order to understand
              how these macromolecules, especially enzymes, precisely work. Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance Spectroscopy has proven over the years to be a viable method to
              determine protein dynamics. But, it has mostly been limited to the
              determination of the motions of the NH vector in proteins.  In this project,
              the dynamical processes of many different vectors in proteins using residual
              dipolar couplings experiments, conformational exchange broadening experiments
              and cross-correlated relaxation measurements will be investigated. To interpret
              these data, theoretical computations of the chemical shift tensors will also be
              carried out.  All these data will be combined to formulate comprehensive
              dynamical models of anisotropic local motion that are important for the
              complete description of the protein's molecular and energetic properties.

              
Proteins are not nearly as static as is often assumed. The molecules have
              intrinsically mobile areas which are necessary to perform diverse functions in
              a living cell.  Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a technique that can
              retrieve the dynamical properties of virtually each atom, individually, in a
              biological macromolecule, such as protein.  The detailed insights will likely
              help in the fundamental understanding of the molecules of life.
