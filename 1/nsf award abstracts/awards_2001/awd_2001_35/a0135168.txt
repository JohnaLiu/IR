The NSF, the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the China
              Seismological Bureau (CSB) of the People's Republic of China are partners in a
              Protocol for scientific and technical cooperation in earthquake studies.  This
              Protocol was initially signed in Beijing in 1980, and extended in 1984, 1990,
              1995, and 2001.  The latest extension (through 2005) was signed on March 28,
              2001 at a signing ceremony hosted by the USGS in Reston, VA.  This ceremony was
              the culmination of an official visit to the US by a Chinese delegation from the
              Ministry of Construction, CSB, and the Chinese Natural National Science
              Foundation which visited several locations within the US.

The terms of the
              Protocol are that the receiving side pays whenever an official delegation
              visits.  Thus, when a Chinese delegation visits the US, NSF and the USGS have
              agreed to split the costs of the delegation.  This transfer of funds to the
              USGS will cover NSF's share of the expenses for the Chinese delegation's visit
              to the U.S.
