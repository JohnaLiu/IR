Abstract    :
              In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Dunning will use atoms in high Rydberg states as a tool
              with which to conduct a comprehensive study of the formation and properties of
              a wide variety of negative ion species. Electron transfer reactions in which
              the excited Rydberg electron is captured by a target molecule will be
              investigated to obtain information on the energetics of dissociative electron
              attachment. This will be accomplished through detailed measurements of the
              angular and velocity distributions of the product ions. Kinematic  studies will
              be used to explore the mechanisms by which such species are created. The
              dependence of their lifetime on the rotational (and vibrational) states of the
              parent neutral will be investigated to gain new insights into the coupling of
              rotational and electronic motions. Collisions of dipole-bound ions with
              attaching and polar targets will be examined to explore their chemical
              properties.

Atoms in which one electron is excited to a high-lying state
              will be used to conduct a comprehensive study of electron capture by molecules.
              Aside from their fundamental interest, the results of this research will have
              important practical application in areas such as breakdown in high-voltage
              electrical equipment, industrial plasma processing, and in screening the
              toxicological properties of new compounds. The work will provide practical
              training for both graduate and undergraduate students and equip them with a
              valuable array of experimental skills in preparation for advanced studies or
              entry into the scientific/technological workforce.
