Abstract    :
              This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research by Professor F. Albert Cotton at Texas A&M University to
              continue studies on using dinuclear complexes to design and synthesize
              molecular architectures including pairs, loops, and polygons as well as 1-, 2-
              and 3-dimensional extended structures.  The communication between the pairs of
              metal atoms will be investigated as the oxidation of the neutral units occurs. 
              Refined synthetic methods should allow for the design of large cavities with
              better shape control and factors for anion and guest recognition.  Diruthenium
              molecules will be used in addition to those involving molybdenum and rhodium. 
              Designs will focus on new structural motifs with a special emphasis on the
              introduction of chirality into the structures.

Molecules with two metal
              atoms will be used as building blocks to design extended lattices with
              interesting structural, magnetic and conductive properties.  Graduate students
              and postdocs will be trained in the synthesis and structural characterization
              of novel supramolecular materials and their applications.
