Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a single investigator to continue work on
              outstanding problems in numerical general relativity.  The proposed projects
              are (1) formulation of boundary conditions for a numerical evolution of the
              Einstein equations, (2) computation of gravitational waveforms in the final
              stages of the coalescence of two black holes, and (3) gravitational radiation
              from the capture of a neutron star by a black hole.  These are all of great
              interest to the community of scientists studying gravitational waves and the
              foundations of general relativity.  Perturbation techniques have been
              successfully employed to deduce properties of some exotic cosmological events
              such as  neutron star-neutron star coalescence (NS-NS inspiral) in the very
              early or very late stages,  but are not sufficient in the intermediate stage of
              the merger.  Large-scale computer simulations are necessary to bridge the gap
              between these extremes.  The research proposed here will seek to develop the
              tools needed for such simulations.  Numerical techniques developed by the P.I.
              and his colleagues have enabled important advances in the past and will be used
              to advantage in the proposed research program.
