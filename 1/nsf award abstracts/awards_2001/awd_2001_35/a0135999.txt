Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59)

This project is hosting a team of undergraduate
              students from WPI to research the state-of-the-art in how laboratory teaching
              experiences are delivered using web-based information technologies.  The team
              of students are completing 7 weeks of foundational research at WPI, then  will
              work on-site at NSF in the Division of Undergraduate Education for another 7
              weeks to complete their project.  The project is ascertaining how the critical
              laboratory components of science and engineering courses and how advanced
              web-mediated learning technologies are being used to complement, supplement, or
              otherwise "convey" laboratory experiences in the undergraduate science and
              engineering curriculum.  The WPI students are receiving academic credit in
              fulfillment of a requisite for the Bachelor of Science degree.  Regular WPI
              faculty, who are resident in Washington with the students, are guiding their
              work with consultation with NSF program directors.   The students will deliver
              a final report to the NSF that will contain, in addition to their revised
              literature review and methodology, presentation of their data and analysis,
              along with conclusions and recommendations.
