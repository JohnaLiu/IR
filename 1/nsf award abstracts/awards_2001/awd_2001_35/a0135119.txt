This proposal describes a long-term research
              directive for studying 
Earth's deep interior and related activities in
              science education in 
seismology and geophysics. An undergraduate and graduate
              course in 
seismology will be developed in Arizona State University's
              Department 
of Geological Sciences, a department that has experienced recent
              
expansion in geophysics/seismology. Many topics in seismology are 
beyond
              the scope of an undergraduate course that uses traditional 
lecturing
              approaches. The new courses will utilize more three 
dimensional
              visualizations using computer imaging and animation, 
along with more
              interactive learning methods and analogies. Both the 
undergraduate and
              graduate course will utilize already in-house 
research tools to study aspects
              of seismic data from recent and past 
relevant earthquakes. Emphasis on
              individual student and group 
discovery will be emphasized in both classes.
              Research activities for 
the proposed period focus on seismic studies of
              Earth's interior, 
with emphasis on the deep mantle. Three main areas of focus
              are: (1) 
determination of seismic heterogeneity, which is used to infer
              
thermal and/or chemical heterogeneity; (2) detection and 
characterization
              of seismic wave speed anisotropy, which is related 
to rheology, dynamics, and
              flow in the mantle; and (3) detection and 
mapping of boundary layers and/or
              discontinuities in seismic 
properties, which may relate to chemical or phase
              boundaries in the 
Earth. The proposed work utilizes travel time and waveform
              analyses 
of relevant seismic waves and tomographic analyses, and will utilize
              
two state of the art computer labs in the department, which are both
              
outfitted with modern PC and UNIX computers. Research efforts
              
characterizing heterogeneity, anisotropy, and boundary layering will
              
include 2- and 3-D travel time and waveform analysis and propagation 
tools,
              an important next step in deep Earth seismology.
