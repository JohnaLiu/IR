COMPRES, the Consortium for Materials Property Research
              in the Earth Sciences, promotes research and education in the area of Earth
              Science materials properties. The goal of this research community is to improve
              our understanding of the Earth and other planetary bodies by better
              understanding the materials that make up these bodies at the conditions that
              are found within the bodies.  Through a community-based consortium approach,
              COMPRES aims to provide the broadest possible access to advanced facilities for
              research on Earth materials. Broad access will be achieved in part through
              educational initiatives and improved user support at advanced, centralized
              research facilities. This program supports the infrastructure for education and
              research including operational costs for national facilities, development
              projects for the community research programs, educational efforts for the
              community, and a central office. The mission of COMPRES is focused within three
              themes: COMPRES Central, Community Facilities, and Infrastructure Development
              Projects.  COMPRES is governed by the community through elected committees and
              officials. The consortium will enable a community-wide approach to setting
              research and development priorities, and identifying the most promising new
              areas of future technology and research.
