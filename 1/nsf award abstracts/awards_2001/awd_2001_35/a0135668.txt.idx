Abstract    :
              As a component of the State Department's contribution to the World Summit
              in Johannesburg (September 2002), this study will examine the geographic
              foundation for natural resource management and development issues in Africa.
              Specific examples will be drawn from case-study regions where USAID and other
              agencies have broad experience. Centered on a place-based, integrative
              framework, the study will draw on experiences of U.S. government agencies,
              international groups, decision-makers, and experts to examine 1) existing
              remote-sensing and GIS efforts in case-study regions, and lessons learned from
              those efforts, 2) existing levels of local expertise and technology, and
              ongoing efforts in geospatial capacity building, 3) a range of questions
              relating to the practical application of new and existing spatial data (e.g.
              required resolution, challenges of integrating layers of environmental and
              social data, and baseline data against which future change can be measured);
              4) the role of decision support systems in the application of these data; and
              5) options for making efforts sustainable beyond 2002.
