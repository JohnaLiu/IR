Abstract    :
              Household Impacts of the Nisqually Earthquake  The February 28, 2001 Nisqually
              earthquake was  moderate in magnitude (Mw = 6.8) and thus provides a unique
              opportunity to measure the economic impacts of an event of this type. This
              project will amass  systematic evidence regarding the economic impacts on
              households through a telephone survey of randomly selected households according
              to zones defined by ground motion levels. This is in sharp contrast to typical
              spatial criteria: political units, zip codes, or census tracts. Three or four
              categories of ground motion will be defined. Survey data will be correlated
              with major categories of impact; damage at the home; financing for repairs;
              changes in economic behavior made as a result of this event; changes in
              mitigation and preparedness (e.g., insurance); and baseline economic and
              demographic information about the households themselves. The results of this
              study will include a large, unique database on household losses.  The
              database will serve to test the hypothesis that actual losses exceeded official
              estimates. The explanation for the difference is that many categories of loss
              are never reported. Insights into the nature and extent of unreported losses
              may help public agencies respond to future disasters as well as better evaluate
              the benefits of pre-disaster mitigation investments. The database will also
              allos reliable estimation of the total amount of loss incurred by households in
              the region. This can provide a baseline against which other loss estimations
              can be compared, e.g., FEMA's HAZUS .
