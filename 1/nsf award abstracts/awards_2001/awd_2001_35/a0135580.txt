Abstract    :
              The University of Kentucky is hosting a conference to bring together the
              recipients of Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and
              Engineering Mentoring (PAESMEM). As part of the conference format, they will
              also include as participants those mentored by the PAESMEM awardees. The
              conference has two main themes:  (1) To continue the efforts to organize
              PAESMEM recipients as a national resource for mentoring; and (2) To highlight
              success in mentoring, especially that involving postdoctoral, graduate,
              undergraduate, or high school student research.
