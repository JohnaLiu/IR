Abstract    :
              Smith, Kenneth P. 0135397  The neuroscience community is accumulating a vast
              amount of human brain mapping data using a variety of techniques that operate
              over a wide range of spatial scales. Currently its use is generally limited to
              the lab of origin; the data is not readily available to other investigators for
              subsequent studies. The overall goal of this research is to design, prototype,
              and evaluate an information infrastructure for human brain mapping data which
              will help realize the full potential of this growing store of mapping data. In
              this initial undertaking, we focus on a system that enables the analysis,
              exploration, and dissemination of structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
              data. Our major aims are: 1) to develop and deploy an operational digital
              library for structural MRI data that will enable users to contribute
              and retrieve data, as well as explore and analyze associated metadata; 2) to
              design a data warehouse of structural MRI data that will allow users to
              manipulate images, explore spatial relationships among regions, and reason
              about abstract attributes of structural regions (e.g., volume); 3) to design
              a content-based retrieval system that will allow users to retrieve images with
              features similar to those in a submitted example; 4) to develop techniques
              that enable users to dynamically aggregate warehouse information into a
              probabilistic brain atlas for specified populations of interest; and 5) to
              develop a prototype system that will ground architecture and query language
              development in a real world setting so that tradeoffs in design choices may be
              accurately evaluated.
