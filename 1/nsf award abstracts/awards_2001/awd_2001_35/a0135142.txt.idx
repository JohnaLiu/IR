Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to develop a performance target (PT)
              sensitive optimizer. Performance targets are relevant in the noisy wide area
              environment where access costs to Internet accessible WebSources exhibit
              transient behavior, and are best characterized by a distribution of access
              costs. A PT sensitive optimizer will have the ability to differentiate among
              multiple alternate WebSources, and to choose a combination of WebSources so as
              to best meet a performance target for some query (and its query evaluation
              plan). The ability to meet a target is quantified by a utility function.
              Existing optimizers and their cost model consider either specific values or
              expected values for access costs, and are not sensitive to performance targets.
              This approach characterizes each plan with the expected value of the cost of
              the plan, as well as the delay; delay is the deviation above the expected
              value. A Cost-Delay measure (CDM) combines these two values using a cost factor
              and a delay factor. A simulation based study of the optimizer's aggregate
              behavior, for a set of queries and a set of remote relations on WebSources will
              be used to correlate the PT optimizer's selection of plans and WebSources with
              its success in maximizing utility or meeting a performance target. The results
              of this project will provide a tunable optimizer for noisy environments that
              allow applications to be sensitive to performance targets and to better utilize
              Internet resources.
