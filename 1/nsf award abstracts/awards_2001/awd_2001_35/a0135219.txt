              ABSTRACT

PI: Krzysztof M. Jarosz
Proposal: DMS-0135219
Institution:
              Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville


 

This proposal requests
              funding for a Fourth Conference on Function
Spaces featuring several
              internationally known leaders in the 
field as principal speakers. This
              conference has a long an 
successful history  and it is expected that it will
              attract a fair
number of graduate students  and young researchers form all of
              the
US. Most of the award funds will  be used to enable them to attend
the
              Symposium. We are confident that  the event will once again be
of significant 
              benefit to a broad mathematical community and 
enthusiastically recommend  the
              award.
