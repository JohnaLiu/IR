Abstract    :
              This prooposal has the specific objective to collect perishable data on injuries
              and related building damage for the recent Nisqually earthquake.  The data
              collected under the proposed effort would enhance existing injury and damage
              databases compiled for recent U.S. earthquakes (the Whittier Narrows, Loma
              Prieta and Northridge earthquakes), and will build on current NSF-funded
              research (CMS 99-00062 & CMS 00-85314) to establish a standardized earthquake
              injury categorization scheme, intended to help refine casualty estimation
              models for earthquake response and mitigation.  Injury data will be collected
              from hospital emergency department logs and abstracted from hospital patient
              records.  Information on building damage and repair cost is collected by
              various local jurisdictions, and is often aggregated at the county and state
              level.  Detailed data may be available from a number of communities, and this
              data will be sought for correlation to data on earthquake-related injuries. 
              This information will be matched by address to injury locations to help
              identify structure-related injury risk factors.  Future work for which
              additional funding will be sought includes:  analysis of trends found in the
              building damage/injury data: cross-sectional survey of the population and
              injury cases for a case-control study of injuries; geographic analysis of
              injuries and building damage; integration into modeling for casualty
              estimation.
