Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, focuses on the use of reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy to
              characterize adsorbed intermediates on solid surfaces.  Professor Trenary and
              his coworkers at the University of Illinois-Chicago will examine adsorbed
              species containing CN multiple bonds, which result from the reactions of
              methane and ammonia and related compounds on well characterized platinum
              surfaces.  High quality experimental data, combined with density functional
              theory calculations, will be used to make structural assignments for these
              adsorbed intermediates.  Instrumentation and method development also forms a
              significant portion of the work being carried out in this project.
              

Reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy is a very powerful tool for the
              identification of adsorbed intermediates in surface reaction chemistry. 
              Professor Trenary and his group at the University of Illinois-Chicago, with the
              support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, have developed an
              active laboratory for the development and use of this method to investigate
              surface reactions.  Work in this project will concentrate on surface
              intermediates formed from the reactions of methane and ammonia adsorbed on
              platinum surfaces, with clear application to the understanding of HCN synthesis
              reactions.
