Abstract    :
              This dissertation project is an investigation of visual culture as an historical
              category that emerged in the colonial period. It challenges the use of visual
              culture in Science and Technology Studies (S&TS) to explain consensus and
              reexamines the role of technology in colonialism. This study specifically looks
              at medical imaging technology in the colonial context and historically traces
              notions of visual culture as they were developed not only by colonial
              administrators but also by users of radiographic technology. The idea of visual
              culture itself was developed and used to legitimize and stabilize relationships
              in colonialism's sociotechnical work. The project shows what the political
              stakes of this epistemological debate were by outlining the role of visual
              culture in establishing a radiographic network in l'Afrique Occidentale
              Francaise (AOF). It argues that radiographic technology, including its
              constituent discourse of "representational tendencies," was used to negotiate
              the professional legitimacy of medical image interpreters and solidify their
              role as political actors in colonial and postcolonial West Africa. NSF funds
              will support interview data in Central African Republic and in Cameroon, and in
              the French Colonial Archives in Aix-en-Provence, France.
