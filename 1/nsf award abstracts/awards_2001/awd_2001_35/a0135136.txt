Abstract    :
              Research under this CAREER award will elucidate the role of surface albedo
              feedback in climate variability and sensitivity. The following outstanding
              issues will be addressed (i) What does our current knowledge of snow and ice
              albedo imply about climate sensitivity? (ii) Do snow and sea ice albedo
              feedback behave differently? (iii) How does albedo feedback impact the
              geographical and seasonal distribution of the climate change signal? (iv) Do
              models need albedo feedback to simulate the observed distribution of the
              climate change signal? (v) What is the impact of albedo feedback on internal
              variability? (vi) Is it possible to extract information about albedo feedback
              contribution to the real climate's sensitivity to a future external forcing
              based on the observed record of climate variability? The PI will perform a
              series of sensitivity experiments with the UCLA General Circulation Mode and
              Community Climate System Model (CCSM) to answer the above questions. For the
              integration of education, the PI will introduce undergraduate students at
              Harvey Mudd and Biklent Univ. Ankara Turkey, to projects related to the climate
              change experiments. Graduate students will be involved in evaluating the
              climate change simulations in a graduate course the PI will be teaching.
              

This research is important because it will improve knowledge about
              processes important to issues of climate change and will help educate future
              scientists.
