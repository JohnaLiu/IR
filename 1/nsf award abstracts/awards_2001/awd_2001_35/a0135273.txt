In recent years there has been an increasing interest in
              developing computational models of the hippocampus aimed at providing
              mechanisms for understanding the processing of mnemonic information.  These
              processes include encoding, consolidation, and retrieval as well as pattern
              separation, short-term and intermediate memory, pattern association, and
              pattern completion. The hippocampus is a very complex brain region that can be
              subdivided into a number of different subregions, including dentate gyrus, CA3
              and CA1.  The computational models emphasize subregional specificity of
              function based primarily on anatomical and physiological recording data, but
              rarely take into account behavioral data. The purpose of this grant proposal is
              to determine whether there is subregional specificity of function within the
              hippocampus using neurotoxic lesion techniques to ensure specificity of lesion
              effects in conjunction with behavioral paradigms designed to measure encoding,
              consolidation, and retrieval as well as pattern separation, short-term and
              intermediate memory, pattern association, and pattern completion processes. The
              outcome of this research should provide for some critical tests of the
              assumptions made by computational models and should aid in the understanding of
              the multiple mnemonic functions of the hippocampus.
