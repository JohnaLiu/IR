Abstract    :
              Abstract CTS-0135910 Fernando Torres-Gil, UCLA  Partial travel support and
              conference preparation costs are requested for the participants at the workshop
              "Nanotechnology: Opportunities and Challenges for Industry" to be held at UCLA
              on September 10, 2001.  The California NanoSystems Institute and the UCLA
              School of Public Policy and Social Research organize the workshop.  The
              sponsors are the Department of Commerce, the Federal Aviation Administration,
              the National Nanotechnology Coordinating Office (NNCO), and the National
              Science Foundation (NSF).    The workshop will bring together 70-80 leaders
              from industry, government, academia and financial community to explore the
              future of nanotechnology, the industry opportunities, and the ways to increase
              the pace of taking advantage of the new technology.  This workshop is part of a
              series of workshops over the next 18 months in various regions of the country. 
              The UCLA workshop will draw attendees from the Western U.S. predominantly with
              focus on importance of nanotechnology in three areas of application: aerospace,
              information technology/electronics, and biotechnology/medicine.  The main
              objectives are: identifying the major technical challenges for application of
              nanotechnology in industry, scientific developments that could be exploited by
              industry, major obstacles in this developments, and networking among experts
              and organizations from various areas.
