Abstract    :
              This project will investigate genome structure and its evolution in rotifers of
              the Class Bdelloidea, an extraordinary group of invertebrate animals that
              appears to have evolved for tens of millions of years without sexual
              reproduction.  In particular, the project will: (i) initiate the basic
              characterization of bdelloid genomes; (ii) examine specific genes for the
              occurrence of genetic recombination within a bdelloid genome; (iii) determine
              the genomic consequences of long-term ameiotic evolution; and (iv) possibly
              discover novel features of bdelloid genomes that might provide insight into
              what has allowed bdelloid rotifers to evolve successfully without genetic
              exchange, and, correspondingly, what causes most other populations of animals
              and plants that become asexual to suffer early extinction - a long-standing
              fundamental problem in biology.
