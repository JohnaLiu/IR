Abstract    :
              The focus of research is the development of synthetic methodology based on the
              use of axially chiral anilides.  New routes for the preparation of anilides
              will be studied and new reactions that transfer axial chirality from precursor
              to product will be developed.  Radical cyclizations, additions and hydrogen
              transfer reactions will make up the initial foci of the work.  Further,
              non-radical reactions such as asymmetric organolithium and organopalladium
              cyclizations will be studied.  The research is designed to advance the
              understanding of the synthesis, structure (including rotational behavior) and
              reactions of axially chiral amides in order to expand the synthetic utility of
              this class of compounds.

With this renewal award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Dennis P.
              Curran of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh. 
              Professor Curran will focus his work on developing methodology for the transfer
              of chirality of synthetic precursors to new stereocenters in products.  The
              work represents a broad-based study of the structural features and synthetic
              potential of a novel class of chiral anilides.  The methodology has fundamental
              importance and could lead to the production of novel catalysts, reagents and
              synthetic intermediates of use to synthetic chemists and, beyond that, to the
              pharmaceutical industry.  The research also provides an appropriate venue for
              the training of students at the graduate level.
