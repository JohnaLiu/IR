Abstract    :
              The Blackfeet Community College-Rural Systemic Initiative (BCC-RSI) proposal is
              an outgrowth of an earlier effort; namely, the Tribal College-RSI that targeted
              a larger geographical area. Having been a part of the earlier challenge to
              coordinate systemic reform efforts for several Indian reservations in five
              states, BCC-RSI proposes to concentrate its reform efforts on the Blackfeet
              Reservation, which consists of approximately 1.5 million acres of land located
              in Glacier County in north central Montana.  The current population on the
              reservation is approximately 9,000 people.  Two separate school districts
              (Browning and Heart Butte) located within the boundaries of the reservation
              serve approximately 1,900 students.  BCC-RSI proposes to service all of the
              three schools from the Heart Butte School District and five of eight schools
              from the Browning School District.  Of these eight schools, the efforts of
              BCC-RSI would impact 98% of the K-8 Indian student population and 100% of the
              Indian high school students on the Blackfeet Reservation.  The BCC-RSI proposes
              to continue to impact student achievement in schools on the reservation by
              promoting the NSF drivers in addition to addressing the social/cultural needs
              of the students and teachers that were identified during their development
              efforts.
