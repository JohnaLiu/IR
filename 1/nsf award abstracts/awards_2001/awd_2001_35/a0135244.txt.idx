Abstract    :
              The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) is organizing a meeting for
              Principal Investigators (PIs) and co-Principal Investigators of currently
              funded DUE projects in the mathematical sciences in Washington, DC in March,
              2002. The meeting brings together PIs of projects funded by the Course,
              Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement Program (CCLI), the Advanced
              Technological Education Program (ATE), and selected PIs of past Course and
              Curriculum Development Program (CCD) projects in the mathematical sciences.
              Meeting themes center on the role of the mathematical sciences in undergraduate
              general education with emphases on the ATE program, teacher preparation, and
              electronic publication, notably through the MAA Mathematical Sciences Digital
              Library (MathDL). An important activity of the meeting is consideration of the
              dissemination of (digital) learning materials in new forms and through new
              vehicles.
