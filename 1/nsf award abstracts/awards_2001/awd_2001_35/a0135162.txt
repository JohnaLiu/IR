Abstract    :
              Lay Abstract: D.H. Edwards (PI), "Neural mechanisms of dominance
              behavior"

The neural bases of dominance hierarchy formation are not well
              understood.  In crayfish and lobster, formation of a dominance hierarchy begins
              with fighting between pairs of animals in which both animals perform similar
              behavior patterns:  approaches, attacks, and offensive tailflips.  At some
              point, one animal becomes subordinate by switching to defensive behavior and
              retreating or performing any of three types of escape tailflips.  The changes
              in behavior result from changes in the excitabilities of the neural circuits
              that mediate the behavior patterns.  Changes in circuit excitability may result
              from changes in neuromodulation of the circuit.  Serotonin is one
              neuromodulator that has been shown to affect escape behavior in a manner that
              depends on the animal's social status.  The present research will determine
              whether serotonin modulates neural circuits for other behaviors that are
              important for dominance decisions, including another form of tailflip, backward
              walking (i.e., retreat), and body posture.  The research will also determine
              whether the serotonergic neurons that normally modulate these circuits are
              themselves affected by changes in social status.  The project will help provide
              a comprehensive view of the role of serotonergic neuromodulation in the
              formation of dominance hierarchies by crayfish.
