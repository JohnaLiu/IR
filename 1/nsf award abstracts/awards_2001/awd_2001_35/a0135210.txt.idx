Abstract    :
              The emission of dimethylsulfide (DMS) from the ocean represents the major
              natural input of sulfur to the Earth's atmosphere. Once in the atmosphere, DMS
              is rapidly oxidized, forming sulfur aerosols that have an important impact on
              atmospheric chemistry and the global climate system. Recent evidence points to
              a key role for members of the marine roseobacter lineage in carrying out these
              globally-important functions. Representatives of the roseobacter group,
              including Silicibacter sp. DSS-3, are known to carry out many, if not most, of
              the major biogeochemical transformations of DMS and its precursor compound,
              dimethylsulfonioproionate (DMSP). Of particular importance is the fact that
              organisms like DSS-3 have the ability to produce DMS from DMSP but also the
              ability to metabolize DMSP by an alternative pathway that bypasses DMS
              altogether.  Little is currently known about how these different pathways are
              regulated in marine bacteria, or how pathway regulation affects the complex DMS
              biogeochemistry in the sea. Thus the genome sequence of Silicibacter sp. DSS-3
              will provide key information for deciphering how marine bacterioplankton
              control sulfur emission from the ocean. In this project, a fully closed and
              annotated sequence of Silicibacter sp. DSS-3 will be obtained, with the goal of
              developing molecular tools that can be used to investigate the microbiology and
              ecology of bacterially mediated organic sulfur transformations in the ocean.
              The roseobacter group is currently the only major lineage of marine
              heterotrophs whose members can be readily cultured and manipulated in the
              laboratory. As such, a genome sequence of Silicibacter sp. DSS-3 will also be
              of broad interest to marine biogeochemists and microbial ecologists. Sequence
              data will be provided to the scientific community through the TIGR Microbial
              Database site (www.tigr.org/tdb/tdb.html). Initial release of the sequence data
              will be in the form of contigs assembled at 3-fold sequence coverage, with
              monthly data releases thereafter.  This is a Microbial Genome Sequencing Award
              funded through a collaborative activity between the National Science Foundation
              and the Department of Agriculture Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food
              Systems.
