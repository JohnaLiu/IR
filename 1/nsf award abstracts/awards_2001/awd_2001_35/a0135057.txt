Abstract    :
              Dr. Timothy Warren, Department of Chemistry, Georgetown University is supported
              by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of the
              Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work under a CAREER
              Award to establish a fundamental understanding of multiply-bound functional
              groups in later, first row complexes that participate in catalytic reactions
              involving cyclopropanation, aziridination and hydrocarbon oxidation.  Dr.
              Warren will prepare carbene, nitrene and oxo complexes of Mn-Cu with a
              promising class of beta-diketiminate ligands in order to lend insight into
              these catalytic processes so as to enable the design of more efficient and
              selective catalysts.

Dr. Warren has integrated research and education by
              developing a course, "Introduction to the Research Experience", that introduces
              motivated freshmen students to the research laboratory through a synthetic
              research project and plans to promote a better understanding of the scientific
              effort through a pilot outreach program to minority-serving DC high schools.
