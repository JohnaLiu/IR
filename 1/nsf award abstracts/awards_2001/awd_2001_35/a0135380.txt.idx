Abstract    :
              Abstract  Support for Carbon Cycle Interagency Working Group  I am writing
              on behalf of the Carbon Cycle Interagency Working Group to request funding for
              scientific coordination activities for the carbon cycle interagency initiative
              in FY2001.  These activities will include two meetings (calendar year 2001)
              of the Carbon Cycle Scientific Working Group, chaired by Chris Field, one
              workshop to develop a comprehensive approach to quantifying and understanding
              the North American component of the Northern Hemisphere terrestrial sink, and
              support for a half time person to serve a project office function at the USGCRP
              office. The total budget request for the FY2001 activities is $196,000. We are
              requesting $34,000 from NSF for their share of this integrated activity.
