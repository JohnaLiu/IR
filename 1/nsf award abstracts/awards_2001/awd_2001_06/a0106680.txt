Title: A global survey of the
              initiation of large earthquakes: The influence of earthquake magnitude and
              depth on the rate of growth of moment release

How earthquakes initiate is a key issue in
              understanding the process of seismic rupture.  For example, the question of how
              seismic ruptures grow and whether large earthquakes initiate in a different
              manner than small ones has attracted significant attention in recent years, but
              remains controversial. We propose to determine the initial rates of growth of
              earthquake ruptures (initial source time functions) with detailed resolution in
              time for many (~150) large earthquakes (with depths of 15 to 100 km and MW \204
              6.7) directly from seismograms.  Systematic comparison and statistical analysis
              of the results will enable us to determine the influences of factors such as
              earthquake magnitude, source depth, focal mechanism, and tectonic setting on
              how ruptures grow in their first few seconds.  Several recent results suggest
              that such influences may exist.  A slow beginning to rupture (seismic
              nucleation phase) proportional in duration to the final magnitude and lasting 4
              to 10 seconds for MW 8.0 to 8.2 earthquakes has been put forward as a general
              feature.  The work proposed here should detect its systematic presence or
              absence in our magnitude range. Systematic differences in the energy budgets of
              small earthquakes compared to large ones have been proposed, which suggest that
              melting or fluid pressurization occurs during large but not small events, and
              affects dynamic rupture.  The duration of rupture is known to decrease with
              depth, implying an increase in the rate of initial rupture growth.  Finally,
              rupture growth could be affected by the aspect ratio (shape) of the fault,
              which is closely related to tectonic regime.  Differences (or their absence) in
              rate of initiation with magnitude, depth, or other parameters can place
              constraints on the physical processes acting during rupture initiation.
