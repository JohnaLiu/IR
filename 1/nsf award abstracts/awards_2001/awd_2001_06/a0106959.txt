Abstract    :
              tHE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES SO THAT
              URBAN AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS, WHO HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT ACHIEVED AT HIGH
              LEVELS, CAN MEET SCIENCE EDUCATION STANDARDS.  FOR THIS PROJECT, WE DEFINE
              INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES AS SCAFFOLDS AND CONTENT REPRESENTATIONS OF ABSTRACT
              SCIENTIFIC IDEAS.  SCAFFOLDS INCLUDE STRATEGIES LIKE MODELING THINKING,
              STRUCTURING AND SEQUENCING TASKS, SUCH AS DATA ANALYSIS, SO THAT LEARNERS CAN
              EVENTUAOLLY TAKE RESPONSIBILITIY FOR THIE WORK (COLLINS, BROWN AND NEWMAN;
              1989).  CONTENT REPRESENTATION OF ABSTRACT SCIENTIFIC IDEAS WILL INCLUDE
              EXAMPLES, METAPHORS, AND ACTIVIEIS TO HELP STUDENTS LEARN IDEAS SUCH AS
              SCIENTIFIC MODELING AND CAUSE AND EFFECT RELATIONSHIP.
