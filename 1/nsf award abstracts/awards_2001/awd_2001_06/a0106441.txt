Open system behavior is ubiquitous in magmatic systems
              but the timing and extent of mixing associated with any single event is poorly
              understood.  The objective of this work is to develop and employ novel
              technologies from information science to extract new structures of data and
              combine them with physical models of multiphase mixing to reveal (in part) the
              physical history of the body.
The central concept is that crystal zoning
              provides for a non-monotonic, but progressive time-series. We significantly
              extend this by doing simultaneous spatial-statistical inversion of all crystal
              zoning patterns for hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of samples.  This provides
              not only the minimum number of chemical events, defined by volumes of unique
              chemical potential, it also allows one to estimate particle trajectories and
              minimum residence times in portions of the system.  Once putative volumes of
              prior chemical potential can be identified (chambers within chambers) isotopic
              microdrilling will be performed on a sub-set of the samples.  This leads to a
              significant savings in time and effort in isotopic analysis as one can focus
              efforts on samples of most interest.
The analysis tools are innovative in that
              they combine a number of recent advances in 1) crystal-chemical isotopic
              studies, 2) information technology and spatial statistics and, 3) multiphase
              modeling, in a combined way that has not been applied previously to problems in
              petrology and volcanology.
