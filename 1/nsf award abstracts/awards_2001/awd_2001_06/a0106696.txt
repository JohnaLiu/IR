We are attempting to show that equilibrium iron-isotope
              fractionations among simple iron-bearing complexes and Fe metal can be
              accurately calculated using a combination of force-field modeling together with
              available measurements of vibrational frequencies from infrared and Raman
              spectroscopy.  This is important because of its pertinence in interpreting the
              exciting new results by other workers of high-precision iron isotope
              measurements on natural materials and between species in aqueous solution and
              those bound to ion-exchange resins. We are also finishing up an oxygen and
              radiogenic isotope study of granitic plutons in Nevada and Utah for which
              preliminary results have shown a systematic involvement of different source
              rocks during each of three stages of magmatism in the Jurassic, Cretaceous, and
              Cenozoic.  A third goal is to complete our understanding of the remarkable
              oxygen isotope patterns in phenocrysts and groundmass found in the upper parts
              of welded ash-flow tuffs, exemplified in our studies of the Bishop Tuff (Holt
              and Taylor, 1998), where we showed that the low-18O zones exhibited a
              one-to-one correspondence with mapped fossil fumarolic structures exposed in
              the uppermost 70-80 meters of the tuff   We are in the process of examining the
              exposed upper 15 meters of the 1912 ash-flow sheet in the Valley of Ten
              Thousand Smokes (VTTS), Alaska (where the fumaroles are known from direct
              observation to have terminated about 15 years after eruption), thereby linking
              the scientific observations made on recently active fumaroles in the VTTS with
              the fossil fumaroles in the Bishop Tuff.
