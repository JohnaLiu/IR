Abstract    :
              This grant provides support for a conference entitled "Beneficial Use of
              Recycled Materials in Transportation Applications) to be held November 13-15,
              2001 in Washington, DC.  The primary sponsor of the conference is the Federal
              Highway Administration through the Recycled Materals Resource Center (RMRC) at
              UNH.  The conference will focus on research and policy topics related to the
              use of different types of recycled materials (e.g. asphalt pavement, reclaimed
              concrete, tires, contaminated soils, coal ash, slags, foundry sands, municipal
              solid waste ash, construction and demolition aggregates, glass, shingles and
              compost) in the highway environment (e.g. pavements, embankments, flowable
              fills and appurtenances).  The conference will bring together educators,
              students, researchers and practitioners interested in research and policy
              associated with recycled materials use in the transportation sector.  
A
              special issue of a research journal, or a book, will be published containing
              peer-reviewed papers from the conference.  Another outcome will be a research
              needs white paper to be published with the conference papers.  This white paper
              will also be distributed to interested Federal and state agencies. ***
