This project is an integrated field, geochronologic,
              geochemical, and petrologic investigation of circa 17 to13 Ma volcanism
              associated with the initial late Cenozoic manifestations of the
              Yellowstone-Newberry hotspot system and with lithospheric extension in the
              Nevada - Oregon border region. The area under investigation, the Santa
              Rosa-Calico volcanic field, lies within the northwestern projection of a major
              late Miocene continental rift regime and is located between two other Oregon
              Plateau volcanic fields that typically are identified with the emergence of the
              Yellowstone-Newberry hotspot system.  The field and analytical strategy is
              designed to provide a comprehensive view of the Santa Rosa-Calico volcanic
              field. Techniques to be employed include GPS/GIS assisted field mapping; air
              photo and satellite remote sensing interpretations; petrographic, chemical and
              isotopic characterization of eruptive products and petrogenetic processes; and
              absolute eruptive history assessment via Ar-Ar age determinations.  Using the
              Santa Rosa-Calico volcanic field as a case study this research will test and
              provide new constraints on hypotheses for [1] the origin of intermediate magmas
              in extensional settings, [2] the role of basaltic magmatism in the formation
              and evolution of evolved magmas, [3] the role of crustal melting and open
              system differentiation processes in the evolution of compositionally diverse
              magmatic suites, and [4] the role that pre- and syn-magmatic extension plays in
              controlling the location, eruptive style(s), and compositional diversity of
              multi-vent volcanic fields.
