Abstract    :

This project will use INSAR (interferometric synthetic
              aperture  
radar) and GPS (Global Positioning System) measurements to monitor 
              
detailed patterns of deformation in the continental collision zone in 
              
eastern Turkey.  The project will take advantage of the synergistic 
              
aspects of these two techniques.  In addition to providing  
quantitative
              constraints on the kinematics and dynamics of the early  
stages of
              continental collision, the investigators anticipate that this research  
will
              result in new and improved tools for combining INSAR and GPS for  
monitoring
              secular deformation of the Earth's surface.
