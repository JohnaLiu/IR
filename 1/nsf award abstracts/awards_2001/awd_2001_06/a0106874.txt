The magma source for Proterozoic massif-type anorthosite
              complexes and the origin of massive sulfide bodies found in some of those
              complexes remain unresolved problems.  We propose that rhenium-osmium (Re-Os)
              concentrations and Os isotope ratios for oxides, sulfides, and silicates from
              two well-studied anorthosite suites will shed light on these issues.  Most
              models based on geochemical data suggest that anorthosite complexes are derived
              from mantle melts that pond and fractionate at the base of the crust, and are
              then variably contaminated by crustal materials during ascent.  Considerations
              from phase equilibria, however, suggest that parental magmas are derived by
              partial melting of a gabbroic source, presumably in the lower crust.  Os
              isotope ratios, which are particularly sensitive indicators of crustal melting
              or assimilation, should help discriminate between competing models.  High the
              initial 187Os/188Os ratios in sulfides from Proterozoic anorthosite complexes
              suggest dominance of crustal Os.  It is unclear, however, whether the crustal
              Os was acquired by selective volatilization and incorporation of crustal
              sulfide, wholesale assimilation of bulk crust, or derivation of parental melts
              by partial melting of a crustal gabbroic source.  We will compare Os isotopic
              data from two systems - the apparently sulfide-free Laramie Anorthosite Complex
              in Wyoming, and the sulfide-bearing Hakefjorden Complex in SW Sweden -  to
              estimate the most likely source for the sulfides and their contained metals. 
              The results could offer an exploration tool for distinguishing sulfide-poor and
              sulfide-rich systems.
