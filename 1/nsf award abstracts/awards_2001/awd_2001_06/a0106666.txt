Title: Global Analyses of Body
              Wave Travel Times and Amplitudes: Whole-mantle Tomography and Simulations of
              3-D Wave Propagation

Seismic tomographic models are beneficial to researchers from a wide
              variety of disciplines in the Earth Sciences. They provide images of the
              structure of oceanic and continental lithosphere, and play a central role in
              constraining the planform of convection in the mantle.

To improve these
              models, we will construct new tomographic models in which we will take
              advantage of the extensive seismic data set that we have compiled in the past
              several years. It includes unique data types, such as higher-mode Rayleigh wave
              phase-velocity measurements and travel times of converted body-wave phases
              (e.g., SP, SKP), which have not been fully exploited in tomography.

In a
              parallel research effort, we apply the new Spectral Element Method of
              Komatitsch and Tromp [1999] to study the effects of 3-D mantle structure on
              long-period body-wave propagation. Specifically, we will test the applicability
              of ray theory to wave propagation in `low-degree' seismic models, whether
              small-scale structure in the deep mantle, such as plumes, produce
              characteristic, observable travel-time or waveform variations, and whether the
              large-scale pattern of long-period body-wave amplitude anomalies can be
              explained by large-scale variation of seismic velocity in the mantle. These
              analyses provide insight into the quality of present-day tomographic models and
              help us design the next generation of tomographic inversions when fully 3-D
              forward theories can be incorporated.
