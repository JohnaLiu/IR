Geodynamicists have made substantial progress over the past
              years in developing sophisticated mantle convection models, including chemical
              heterogeneity, temperature and strain-rate dependent rheology, realistic 3-D
              spherical shell geometry and convective vigor that is nearly Earthlike. In to 
              apply the new modeling capability to study the flow history of Earth's mantle,
              mantle convection models must be properly initialized, i.e. one must constrain
              initial conditions into the past. This is an inverse problem and the PI
              proposes to evaluate the potential of adjoint fluid dynamic inverse theory to
              track mantle heterogeneity back into the relatively recent Cenozoic and
              Mesozoic history of our planet. To this end, a novel 3-D spherical
              high-resolution adjoint model of mantle convection will be developed. The PI
              will apply the adjoint method in idealized mantle convection models for time
              periods of less than one convective overturn, in order to explore the
              feasibility of the method to estimate unknown initial conditions back in time.
              The PI will constrain unknown initial conditions in mantle convection
              calculation through a series of coupled forward-in-time and adjoint
              backward-in-time integrations, a difficult task facilitated by the rapid
              advance in supercomputer capabilities. The outcome of the work will be to
              explore the utility of adjoint fluid-dynamic inverse theory in retrieving flow
              structure back in time in mantle convection models.  (Code benchmark is
