Abstract    :
              Understanding the dynamics of biotic response to past environmental change is
              an
essential element for predicting the effect on the earth's biosphere of
              future
environmental change. Although time-series data in the geologic record
              represents the
major source of information describing the dynamics of this
              past biotic response,
methodological and administrative gulfs between
              biological scientists and earth
scientists, and among real-time, recent-past,
              and deep-time approaches, have hindered
basic research and its application to
              policy issues. This study will describe mechanisms
for promoting the
              interdisciplinary science at the interface of biology and geology that
depends
              on the collection, analysis, and understanding of biogeologic time-series
              data.
The study will provide the basis for informed decision-making in
              government, industry, and academia, by (1) assessing the current state of
              biogeologic analysis relevant to biosphere dynamics; (2) identifying the most
              promising directions for collaborative research and the sharing of
              methodologies; and (3) describing the programmatic themes and research and data
              infrastructures required to accomplish these interdisciplinary objectives
