The Great Falls tectonic zone is a NE-trending feature that
              extends from northeastern Idaho to the Montana - Saskatchewan border, and may
              represent the collisional suture between the Archean Wyoming province and the
              Hearne province of the Canadian shield.  However, recent work has raised the
              alternative interpretation that the Great Falls tectonic zone is an
              intracontinental shear zone reactivated by the Trans-Hudson orogeny and another
              feature represents the Wyoming-Hearne suture.  This project will examine newly
              documented 1.86 Ga meta-igneous rocks of the Great Falls tectonic zone that
              will address several fundamental issues associated with the assembly of
              southern Laurentia and the breakup of Rodinia.  Results are expected to help
              clarify the interpretation of the significance of the Great Falls tectonic zone
              in relation to the development of the Pacific Northwest.
