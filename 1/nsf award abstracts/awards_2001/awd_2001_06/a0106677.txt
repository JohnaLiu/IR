Abstract    :
              0106677 Yin & Horton
Current hypotheses concerning the formation of the Tibetan
              plateau are widely different in terms of their predicted strain distribution
              and temporal evolution of the plateau.  If the uplift involved little upper
              crustal shortening and was passively uplifted, shortening strain should be
              small and synchronous.  If the uplift was due to large shortening that doubled
              the upper crustal thickening, strain should be significant and diachronous
              across the plateau.  This project will attempt to evaluate upper crustal
              deformation and therefore test these two models for the evolution of the
              Tibetan plateau.  Results are expected to provide new constraints on how and
              when the Tibetan plateau was constructed and allow various mechanisms for
              uplifting the plateau to be quantified.
