Abstract    :
              This is a project in the area of mathematics called number theory.  Professor
              Katz will investigate varieties defined over finite fields, in particular their
              cohomology and the distribution of the zeros of L functions on such
              varieties.

This is a project in the area of mathematics called number
              theory.  The main focus of this project can be described as the study of
              certain kinds of solutions to polynomial equations called "modular solutions." 
              Many of the applications computer scientists have for number theory involve
              these kinds of solutions.  Professor Katz is considering questions involving
              the number of such solutions, how this number changes as the polynomials
              change, and how the solution sets of different polynomials are related.
