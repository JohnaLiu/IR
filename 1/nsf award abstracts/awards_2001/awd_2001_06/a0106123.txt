The late Mesozoic to early Tertiary geology
              of California is characterized by an arc-forearc-accretionary wedge sequence
              produced during convergence with the Farallon plate.  These elements have been
              severely disrupted in southern California, resulting in eastern facies being
              emplaced over western and underthrusting of the enigmatic Pelona-Orocopia-Rand
              Schists.  This project will follow up on prior results of work on this system
              that indicate eastward younging in the schists, and that provenance of the
              schists matches the provenance in the overlying basement rocks.  The results of
              this extensive detrital zircon dating effort is expected to discriminate
              between several possible tectonic scenarios for the development of this complex
              geology.  Results are key to understanding the late Mesozoic to early tertiary
              tectonic environment of the California sector of the western cordillera.
