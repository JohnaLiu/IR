Title: Structure and Dynamics of
              Earth's Core and Lowermost Mantle

This proposal is to conduct research in the
              following related areas concerning the structure and dynamics of Earth's core
              and lowermost mantle. (1) The study will seek to constrain the inner core
              rotation using differential PKP travel-time measurements and joint inversion of
              inner core rotation and fine lateral structure of inner core and lower mantle.
              This study will also address uncertainties in determining inner core rotation,
              in particular the possibility of systematic biases from event mislocation. (2)
              This study will seek to constrain fine structure of the inner core by modeling
              of detailed waveforms and increasing lateral samples of various depths of the
              inner core. (3) This study will seek to constrain the structure of lowermost
              mantle by using differential travel times and waveforms of seismic core phases,
              which remove or reduce biases from upper mantle heterogeneities and source
              uncertainties
