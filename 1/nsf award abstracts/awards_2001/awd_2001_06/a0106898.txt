              ABSTRACT

Origin of Siltstone Facies in the Permian Phosphoria
              Formation

Alan Carroll
EAR-0106898

Silty marine mudrocks represent one
              of the most volumetrically important sedimentary rock types, but their genesis
              remains very poorly understood. The proposed study will investigate siltstone
              facies contained within the Permian Phosphoria Formation in the western U.S.  A
              regional sedimentologic and stratigraphic investigation will be conducted to
              assess the importance of suspension settling versus other depositional
              processes, and to examine the relationship of siltstone and other facies to
              changing sea level.  Oxygen isotopic analyses of different quartz grain size
              fractions will be used to constrain their temperature of crystallization and
              thus their origin (reworked versus primary quartz).  Finally, grain size
              distributions from siltstone and other silty facies will be measured at a
              number of widely distributed sites.  These measurements, combined with
              high-resolution stratigraphic studies, will be used to examine grainsize trends
              across the Phosphoria sea.
