SAFOD, the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth, intends to
              drill through the San Andreas fault to study internal fault properties that
              control earthquakes.  Parkfield, in central California, was chosen as the drill
              site because it is the best characterized seismically active segment of the
              fault.  Interesting observations include high electrical conductivity, low
              seismic velocity, high Poisson's ratio, and seismic anisotropy within the fault
              zone.  However, other than a thin low velocity zone identified by fault-zone
              guided waves, the earthquake data only constrain seismic velocity structure on
              the scale of 2 km and larger.  Earthquakes are well located in a relative
              sense, but have up to 1 km of absolute error and do not line up with the active
              surface fault trace.  Better site characterization can improve the drilling
              plan and its ability to accurately target a specific patch of repeating
              earthquakes on the fault.

This project will perform a high resolution, 2-D
              seismic profile of the SAFOD site with the specific aim of imaging steeply
              dipping structures in and near the fault at depth.  Previous work by the
              Principal Investigator produced the first-ever migrated image of seismic
              reflections from the near-vertical San Andreas fault, allowing direct imaging
              of the fault trace at a depth of about 1 km.  This project aims to repeat this
              success beyond the 4 km depth at which drilling will penetrate the fault.  The
              Principal Investigator plans a 50-km combined seismic reflection and refraction
              line across the San Andreas fault at the drill site.  Very dense shot and
              receiver spacings and very long recording offsets will allow the survey to
              obtain detailed seismic velocity structure at a resolution of ~0.5 km
              horizontally and ~0.25 km vertically down to about 5 km depth. These images
              will better constrain the location of the fault trace and fault zone at depth,
              its relation to anomalous fault-zone properties, and the overall structure of
              surrounding geologic units and related faults.
