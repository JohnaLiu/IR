Rates of processes control a wide variety of geologic
              phenomena.  With the development of more precise and refined radiometric age
              dating techniques, it is becoming increasingly apparent that processes in
              magmatic arcs such as magma generation and ascent may occur at relatively fast
              rates and over a wide range of durations.  In contrast, existing data sets for
              regional deformation suggest that rates of various processes such as faulting,
              shearing, and folding are several orders of magnitude slower than rates of
              magma generation, migration, and emplacement. This research is utilizing field,
              microstructural, and experimental rock deformation data sets to address the
              following questions: (1) What micro- and macro-scale deformation mechanisms
              accommodate deformation in contact aureoles? (2) What are the magnitudes of
              stress in the host rocks during plastic deformation associated with chamber
              construction? (3) What are the host rock strain rates during plastic
              deformation associated with chamber construction? And (4) What are "typical"
              viscosities in contact aureoles? Detailed mapping and microstructural analysis
              conducted on two pluton-host rock systems, exposed in the Clark Mountains of
              eastern California, as well as application of experimentally-derived flow laws
              and paleo-piezometers (paleo-stress gauges) to deformed contact aureole rocks
              are currently being carried out to evaluate these questions and provide
              constraints on contact aureole stresses, strain rates and viscosities.
