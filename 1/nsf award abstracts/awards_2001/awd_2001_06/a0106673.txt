     A novel technique for determining the mechanisms,
              rates, and magnitude of decompression during unroofing of mountain belts,
              including quantifying the magnitude of high-temperature decompression and the
              unroofing pressure-temperature trajectory of formerly deep rocks, involves
              interpreting microcrack patterns in garnet. Of particular interest are
              microcracks that radiate from mineral inclusions, as their formation is likely
              initiated by decompression.  By documenting the conditions at which the
              difference between lithostatic pressure and the internal pressure on mineral
              inclusions will fracture a host garnet in a radial pattern about the inclusion,
              it may be possible to calculate tectonic variables related to exhumation of
              mid- to lower-crustal rocks. This research involves (1) determination of the
              fracture toughness of silicate garnets as a function of temperature,
              composition, and crystal orientation, and (2) documentation and comparison of
              garnet microstructures in inclusion-rich and inclusion-free regions of garnets
              with well-constrained tectonic histories. Microstructures in the vicinity of
              inclusions surrounded by microcracks are compared with those near inclusions
              with no microcracks. Garnet properties will be determined using micromechanical
              testing apparatus, microstructures will be observed with high-resolution
              transmission electron microscopy, and structural domains will be assessed using
              electron backscatter diffraction techniques.   Results from this research have
              applications to other decompressed materials (e.g., garnet-bearing mantle
              xenoliths) and provide fundamental information about the brittle behavior of
              garnet.
