This award to University of Texas Austin provides a new,
              ruggedized computer system to update and expand the oceanographic research data
              acquisition capabilities of the research vessel Longhorn, a ship operated by
              the University of Texas Marine Science Institute as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.
              This  improvement will be of substantial advantage to marine scientists using
              the ship in their research during 2001 and future years.
