Aqueous fluids in the Earth's crust
              participate in nearly all geologic processes, including partial melting, heat
              and solute transport, reaction and alteration of host country rock, deposition
              of insoluble minerals in fractures, and rock deformation. The extent to which
              fluid participates in these processes depends on its chemical and transport
              properties. The H2O-CO2-NaCl system is a close approximation to real crustal
              fluids. An understanding of the p-V-T-x properties of this system is critical,
              and an experimental determination of the thermophysical properties at high
              temperatures and pressures is clearly required to be able to understand the
              fluid-rock interaction in crustal geologic processes. We, in collaboration with
              J. Blencoe, propose to determine experimentally the phase relations and
              thermodynamic properties of the H2O-CO2-NaCl system at pressures ranging from
              100 to 300 MPa and temperatures from 500 to 800 degrees C. These conditions lie
              above the critical curve of the H2O-CO2 binary, span the critical curve in the
              H2O-NaCl binary, and are appropriate for many crustal fluid-rock processes. We
              will determine the halite saturation surface and the activities of H2O on the
              surface with the use of an internally heated pressure vessel equipped with
              hydrogen service. With these data, we will be able to determine the phase
              equilibria and the activity-composition relations for the ternary system.  The
              results will be complementary to studies of the system that use synthetic fluid
              inclusions and will provide the basic input necessary to construct mathematical
              models of the thermodynamics of the H2O-CO2-NaCl system at conditions
              appropriate for crustal geothermal, metamorphic, and deformation systems.
