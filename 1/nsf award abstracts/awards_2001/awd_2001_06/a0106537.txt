Title: Local and teleseismic
              studies of Hawaiian earthquakes

PI's: Cecily Wolfe, Univ
              Hawaii

Earthquakes in Hawaii are abundant, and provide key information on
              the nature of magmatic and tectonic processes at this oceanic hotspot.  There
              are shallow crustal earthquakes associated with magma intrusions and eruptions,
              earthquakes in the middle-to-upper lithospheric mantle suggested to reflect
              magma migration, earthquakes that relieve stresses due to volcano growth and
              volcano spreading. In addition, there are enigmatic crustal and mantle
              earthquakes that may be due to a variety of factors, including inherited zones
              of structural weakness, stresses due to volcano loading and lithospheric
              flexure, magma movement, and thermal cooling stresses.  This project will
              conduct two studies: 1) waveform modeling of teleseismically-recorded
              earthquakes (Mw > 4.5) in order to constrain earthquake mechanisms and moments
              throughout Hawaii, including in many regions where the United States Geological
              Observatory Hawaii Volcano Observatory seismic network geometry is insufficient
              to provide a first-motion mechanism; and 2) the relocation of locally-recorded
              seismicity for specific targets using high-precision techniques. The
              combination of teleseismic waveform modeling to yield accurate mechanism
              solutions and high precision relocations to yield accurate hypocenters promise
              to improve our view of the seismotectonics of the Hawaiian Islands and will aid
              in the evaluation of earthquake hazards.
