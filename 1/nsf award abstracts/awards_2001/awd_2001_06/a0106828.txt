Title: The Long-Term Dynamics and
              Evolution of Dip-Slip Faults

The goal of this project is to
              investigate the effects of multiple earthquakes on the dynamics of dip-slip
              faults. Observations and models of dip-slip earthquakes have shown that
              non-vertical faults behave in ways that are quite different from vertical
              strike-slip faults. In particular, these faults display higher motion on the
              hanging wall, marked changes in the direction of slip along strike, and greater
              motion for thrust events than for otherwise equivalent normal events. This
              project will help determine if these and other effects persist over multiple
              earthquake cycles. Additionally, the researchers will investigate whether
              (under reasonable physical assumptions) dip-slip faults will reach a steady
              state over time, or if complexity in stress and slip will grow. Finally, the
              researchers will analyze the effect that the long-term evolution of the fault
              has on near-source ground motion. The project will use a combination of the
              finite element and variational boundary integral methods to model the dynamics
              of the rupture and slip process, as well as loading and nucleation during the
              interseismic period. The results will have implications for both the basic
              physics of the earthquake process as well as seismic hazard.
