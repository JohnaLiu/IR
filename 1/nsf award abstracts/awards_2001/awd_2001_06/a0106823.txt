Title: Dynamic-Stochastic Modeling
              of Earthquake Rupture and Strong Ground Motion

In this study we will develop an earthquake source model that
              simultaneously satisfies: (1) a previously derived stochastic model of the
              distribution and variability of slip on the fault consistent with observations
              of past earthquakes and (2) a simple physical model of the earthquake source
              that characterizes dynamic rupture by the distribution of stress drop and
              fracture energy.  The result will be a model for earthquakes that is consistent
              with both observations of the earthquake source and rupture dynamics.  This
              will provide a complete description of the earthquake source that includes
              variability in the slip distribution, rupture velocity, rise time, and shape of
              the slip velocity function in a self-consistent way.  We will use this
              stochastic-dynamic source model to predict the level and variability of strong
              ground motion for scenario earthquakes.  The use of a stochastic source
              description and output that consists of a suite of possible ground motion time
              histories, will merge naturally with the probabilistic approach that is usually
              adopted for seismic hazard analysis.
