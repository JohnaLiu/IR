Volcanic eruptions produce complex clouds of gas, ash and
              aerosol mixtures which can be observed in the Earth's atmosphere for minutes to
              years. Their dynamics, and the chemistry and physics of their evolution, are
              poorly known yet form the basis for our understanding and mitigation of
              aircraft hazards, local to regional health effects from fallout, and the
              potential for global climatic impact. Because the combination of volcanologic,
              geographic, and atmospheric settings is largely unique for each event, a
              process-oriented study combining observations, modeling, and laboratory
              efforts, is warranted.
In this proposal, we plan to integrate remote sensing
              studies of several key examples of volcanic clouds from activity of the past 10
              years. We combine numerical models of volcanic eruptions that include
              microphysical processes, ground-based observations of fallout materials, direct
              sampling of the clouds, meteorological data and lab-based studies of ash/ice
              particles. Emphasis is placed on the evolution of volcanic clouds during a
              period lasting hours to about one week. 
The direct results of our efforts are
              expected to clarify issues related to the mechanisms of fallout and hazards of
              fine ash, the conversion of SO2 to sulfate, and the role of ice in various
              reactions and processes. The results are important in understanding a wide
              range of local and global scale environmental effects of eruptions, ranging
              from livestock poisoning to respiratory disease to hypercanes to climate change
              to mass extinctions. They are also significant to the mitigation of hazards to
              aircraft. We focus on four eruptions, all for which we have amassed
              considerable observational data and experience, and which span a range of
              volcanic and atmospheric environments: (1) The February 26, 2000 Hekla fissure
              eruption, which represents an ash-poor example and which fortuitously has
              important validation information associated with it; (2) The December 26, 1997
              eruption at Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat, which is marked by significant
              interaction with the ocean; (3) The three 1992 subplinian Spurr eruptions which
              have unusually extensive and complete observational constraints; and (4) The
              climactic June 15, 1991 Pinatubo event, the largest well-documented eruption of
              the past century.
