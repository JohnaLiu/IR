Abstract    :
              This project addresses the growing importance of data literacy as a fundamental
              skill for living in a democratic society and the disheartening fact that few
              people have a solid understanding of data.  It addresses this need by studying
              how advanced visualization tools can affect teachers' and students' develop
              understanding of several crucial statistical concepts.  The project focuses on
              how people understand distributions of data, how they compare two groups of
              data, and how they think about convariation; it examines the ways in which
              powerful visualization tools can facilitate the learning of these concepts.  As
              a collaboration betwee educational software developers and educational
              researchers, the project takes advantage of the expertise of both groups in
              order to 1) develop a research foundation that elucidates teaching/learning
              processes in the area of statistical covariation; 2) develop a set of design
              principles for statistical education tools that best support statistical
              learning; 3) use the largely untapped design expertise of commercial software
              designers in educational research; and 4) leverage NSF's investment in
              educational software development.  The ultimate goal is to accelerate the
              development of both statistical education research and software in ways that
              would be impossible without such a collaboration.
