The isotopes of boron have been shown to fractionate from one
              another as boron is lost from a silicate melt into coexisting water vapor. Work
              funded by this proposal will measure the amount of boron isotope fractionation
              between melts and a variety of fluids for melts of basaltic, andesitic, and
              granitic composition. Fluids will be water or carbon dioxide, or mixtures
              thereof. A range of temperatures will be studied to mimic natural conditions. 
              The evolution of silicate melts (magmas) during generation, transport, and
              cooling (either at the surface of the earth or below) generally involves (at
              one stage or another) the formation of a fluid phase. The experimental data on
              boron fractionation proposed here will allow the application of a new stable
              isotope system to unraveling the history of silicate melts. A specific
              application is to magmas formed along volcanic arcs. Study of these samples can
              help constrain the varying contribution of the subducting slab to the source
              regions of these melts, and can clarify the effects of degassing during the
              ascent of magmas.
