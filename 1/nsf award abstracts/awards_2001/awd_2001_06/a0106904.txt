Title: High Resolution Imaging
              of Seismic Velocity Discontinuities

PI: Anne F. Sheehan, University of
              Colorado, Boulder

Seismic estimates of existence and depth distribution of
              crust and mantle discontinuities are important for constraining models of
              composition, rheology, and temperature in the Earth. This project includes
              development, testing, and application of new methods for receiver function
              imaging. A Kirchhoff-style migration methodology which utilizes a
              point-scattering approach to handle nonplanar and laterally discontinuous
              interfaces has been developed. An uncertainty in this analysis is the biasing
              effects of three-dimensional discontinuity structure that could falsely project
              features into two-dimensional models. The migration inversion will be extended
              to three dimensions, and include back-scattered energy. Proper evaluation of
              the accuracy and resolution of these P/SV migration methods will require
              development of a synthetic seismogram method that can handle 3-D discontinuity
              topography and velocity heterogeneity and which will include all converted
              phases and surface reflections. A hybrid method will be implemented that will
              use ray theory to propagate a P wavefront to a finite difference grid that will
              span the region between the discontinuities and the surface. These techniques
              will be applied to regional data sets from the southwest Pacific and eastern
              California. These efforts are of great utility with appropriate data sets today
              and will become increasingly important with data sets that will be generated by
              the proposed USArray and similar projects.
