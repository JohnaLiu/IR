The study is to make precise measurement of the
              acoustic wave velocities at simultaneous high-pressures and temperatures
              (P-Vp-Vs-T measurements) and the equation of state  (P-V-T relations) for
              Mg3Al2Si3O12-pyrope garnet. The experiments will be conducted in a cubic anvil
              DIA-type high pressure apparatus, SAM-85, which is installed on the super
              conducting wiggler beam line (X17B1) at the National Synchrotron Light Source
              of the Brookhaven National laboratory. The high pressure and high temperature
              elasticity data, as well as the equation of state data, will be compared with
              data for Mg3Al2Si3O12-pyrope garnet obtained by other elasticity techniques
              using single-crystal or polycrystalline specimens. The study will utilize
              existing polycrystalline specimens of Mg3Al2Si3O12-pyrope garnet and other new
              specimens hot-pressed in a 2000-ton uniaxial split-sphere apparatus (USSA-2000)
              at conditions up to 5 GPa, and 1350C.  Samples will be characterized by x-ray
              diffraction, optical, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and by
              bench top ultrasonic techniques, to ensure that  the  specimens are
              singled-phase, fine-grained and pore- and crack-free.
