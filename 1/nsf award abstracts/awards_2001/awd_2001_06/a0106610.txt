Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a meeting on basic and applied aspects of
              fish bioacoustics to be held in mid-2001 in Chicago.  There are investigators
              interested in basic issues of fish bioacoustics ( hearing, sound production,
              etc.), others interested in use of sound to assay fish populations, and still
              others are interested in the effects of intense sound on fish behavior and the
              potential use of sound to control fish behavior.   However, there has been very
              little interaction or collaboration among these investigators.  Each of these
              groups has unique knowledge and approaches to questions, and these
              investigators and their fields would benefit from interactions.  Thus, the
              purpose of the proposed meeting is to bring together investigators interested
              in all basic and applied aspects of fish biocacoustics to present material,
              share ideas, and most importantly, learn from, and develop an understanding of,
              the questions and approaches taken by one another.   The conference is designed
              to foster these interactions and help investigators with widely different
              research interests get to know one another.  Long-term goals of the conference
              are to educate those in the field who don't normally interact professionally,
              and to help establish collaborations among investigators across disciplines and
              research fields
