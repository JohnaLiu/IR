Seismic studies of Earth's solid inner core indicate that
              the inner core 
is elastically anisotropic and inhomogeneous, and that the
              apparent axis 
of inner core anisotropy may rotate differentially from Earth's
              mantle. In 
order to fully interpret these data, information is needed on
              shear wave 
propagation through dense, high-pressure metals, particularly
              iron. For 
most candidate lower mantle constituents the bulk moduli, as
              functions of 
pressure, are reasonably well constrained by experiment; less,
              however, is 
known about the behavior of the shear modulus. Efforts to
              understand both 
radial and lateral variation of seismic velocities in the
              lower mantle are 
limited by the remaining uncertainty in the pressure and
              temperature 
dependence of the shear elastic constants.  

Using the
              technique of Impulsive Stimulated Scattering, interfacial waves 
can be
              generated between the suface of an opaque sample in the 
high-pressure
              diamond-anvil cell and the surrounding pressure medium. The 
velocities of
              these waves, which are particularly sensitive to the shear 
elastic constants,
              are then determined. Specific goals 
include: (1) determination of full
              tensorial elastic and thermal 
properties  of iron, iron alloys, and other
              metals at high pressures and 
(2) determination of isotropic elastic shear
              moduli at very high pressure 
of synthesized, polycrystalline, lower mantle
              phases.
