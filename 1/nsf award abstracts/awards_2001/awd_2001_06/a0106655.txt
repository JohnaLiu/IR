This proposal requests funds to partially support a two-day
              workshop entitled "Phase Transitions and Mantle Discontinuities".  The workshop
              will be held on April 5-6, 2001, at the GeoForschungsZentrum in Potsdam,
              Germany.  The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from a
              variety of disciplines to examine what is known, as well as what is not
              understood, about seismic discontinuities in the mantle and their implications
              for the state of the Earth's deep interior.  The scientific program will
              include presentations in the areas of seismology, mineral physics, geodynamics,
              and geochemistry, each of which provides an opportunity to present and debate
              new results with colleagues in related but distinct disciplines, and to
              summarize the state or our understanding in several areas related to the
              Earth's mantle. A high degree of cross-fertilization between disciplines is one
              of goals of the workshop.  Funds will be allocated primarily to offset expenses
              associated with the travel and participation of U.S. graduate students in the
              workshop.
