The investigators address North America
              plate dynamics by modeling 
the forces applied to the
plate and comparing the
              predicted stresses with those inferred from the style
of ongoing tectonics and
              those observed in drill holes.  Modeling is done with
the finite element
              method.  Input forces applied to modeled North America
include boundary and
              basal forces, and those generated internal to the plate
(arising from
              potential energy variations such as those created by topography).
The relative
              magnitudes of applied forces are estimated to account for stress
and
              deformation information.  Furthermore, because the magnitude of many of
              the
forces applied North America are well known a priori (such as ridge push),
              the
magnitude of all the the applied forces will be well constrained. 
              Tectonic
stresses deform North America at a rate inversely proportional to its
              strength.
The investigators model strength with a viscous rheology, which they
              
estimate by ratioing the
calculated stress with the (reasonably well known)
              strain rate.
The research can be divided into several tasks: estimation of
              input fields,
description of an appropriate finite element representation of
              North America,
evaluation of model predictions against observables, and as
              modeling progresses
toward resolving the input fields and assessment of their
              uniqueness.
