This grant provides partial support of the costs of acquiring
              a bench-top gas chromatograph - mass spectrometer (GC/MS) for the organic
              geochemistry laboratory at the Brown University.  The PI, Yongsong Huang is an
              assistant professor at Department of Geological Sciences.  In addition to
              Huang, several other faculties at Geology (Herbert, Prell, Webb, Clemens,
              Murray and Schultz) and Environmental Studies Program (Hamburg, Ward) at Brown
              University will have access to the GC/MS for their research. This facility will
              also contribute significantly to the educational objectives for undergraduate
              and graduate students.  The addition of a bench-top GC/MS will allow convenient
              identification of organic compounds in sediments, soils and plant samples. The
              instrument is an important tool for various aspects of organic geochemical
              research, particularly those involving compound-specific isotope analyses.  The
              identity and purity of organic compounds must be established by structural
              GC/MS in order for their isotopic measurements to be meaningful. The instrument
              will also facilitate research collaboration in and outside Brown University. 
              The bench-top GC/MS will be housed in a newly renovated 650 square-foot room,
              specifically designed to accommodate mass spectrometers and various peripheral
              devices.  Support for this grant is shared between the Earth Sciences
              Instrumentation and Facilities Program (EAR/IF) and the Division of Ocean
              Sciences (OCE).
