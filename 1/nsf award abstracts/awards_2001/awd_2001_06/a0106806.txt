Large rivers are an important element in the geodynamic -
              evolution of orogens, as they define base level for drainage and removal of
              considerable material.  However, at spatial scales consistent with crustal
              tectonics, it is difficult to decipher the incision histories of major rivers
              because the erosion they facilitate removes most of the direct evidence. 
              Helium dating of apatite has the potential to provide timing information of
              river incision in orogenic areas.  This project will examine the Indus River
              incision history as it crosses the Nanga Parbat metamorphic massif in Pakistan.
               Results will be useful in testing theories of tectonics and topography of the
              Himalaya.
