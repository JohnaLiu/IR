Widespread remnants of Cenozoic sedimentary
              rocks in the central Rocky Mountains may indicate the former presence of a
              large post-Laramide basin fill that has subsequently been largely removed.  If
              such a regional basin fill can be demonstrated, it would provide a regional
              marker for determining the extent and rate of sediment removal and provide a
              marker for vertical tectonic movement during the late Cenozoic.  This project
              will combine mapping fission-track and cosmogenic nuclide geochronometry to
              attempt to determine the former extent and continuity of the post-Laramide
              basin fill, and to search for possible tectonic or geologic causes of the
              observed changes.  Results will help clarify the competing effects of tectonic
              verses climatically driven uplift.
