This pilot project will characterize the Li isotopic
              composition of the Earth's mantle.  This project will concentrate on both
              solution and laser introduction of Li to our Nu plasma multicollector ICP-MS. 
              We will begin by analysing international rock standards in solution, then will
              proceed with mineral separates from peridotites (olivine, orthopyroxene and
              clinopyroxene).  Our ultimate goal is to determine the range of Li isotope
              values in the Earth's mantle, as sampled by a variety of peridotitic xenoliths
              derived from lithosphere of variable ages and tectonic settings that have
              experienced a variety of metasomatic overprinting processes.  In addition, we
              hope to establish the degree of isotopic heterogeneity between coexisting
              phases.
