Kimberlite is the magma type that is the carrier of
              most diamonds from the deep interior (mantle) of the Earth.  These magmas
              generally erupt at the Earth's surface, form a pipe-like throat near the
              surface where the diamonds are found, and are commonly associated with another
              magma type called carbonatite.  Kimberlites are generally understood to
              represent the greatest depth of origin of any magma type and therefore tell us
              something about the Earth's interior at depths not generally sampled. 
              Traditionally, the depth of origin has been thought to be about 220 km., but
              the recent discovery of exotic mineral inclusions in a very few diamonds
              indicates an origin much deeper in some cases, possibly even to the core-mantle
              boundary.  Experimental data on the chemistry of melting processes at depths in
              excess of about 200 km are very sparse.  This project is designed to examine
              melting relations for compositions that model the Earth's deep interior at
              depths up to about 430 km.  The apparatus used for this study is called a
              multianvil press and is capable of duplicating temperatures and pressures
              thought to be relevant to possible melting process at these great depths.  The
              purpose is to determine the temperature of melting as pressure increases and
              the compositions of the melts generated.  These data will provide quantitative
              data that will help resolve the issue of whether melting at these depths is
              reasonable or if the diamonds are transported slowly from extreme depths by
              solid-state convective processes in the mantle, to be sampled by kimberlites
              generated at more traditionally accepted depths of about 220 km.
