This award provides partial support for
              participants at a 
conference on Algebraic Topological Methods in Computer
              Science 
to be held at Stanford University, July 30 through August 3, 2001. 
              There has been increasing interest in the potential applications of algebraic
              topology in recent years.  Topology has now become a 
valuable tool in
              computational geometry, as well as a method for studying various problems in
              algorithms and combinatorics. This conference will cover several different
              themes, including topology 
in computational geometry, topology and
              algorithms, topology in combinatorics, and topology as an aid to visualization.
               The speakers include many of the leaders in this area, including both
              mathematicians with an interesting in computational questions as well as
              computer scientists who are applying algebraic topology in various ways. We
              expect substantial participation from researchers in Silicon Valley 
who ae
              working in this area. Further information, including invited speakers, schedule
              of talks, and housing information, is available at http:// math.stanford.edu
