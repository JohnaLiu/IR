Abstract    :
              This project consists of laboratory studies of the kinetics and mechanism of the
              reaction of OH (hydroxyl radical) with pinenes, which are important biogenic
              hydrocarbons. In the atmosphere, these reactions lead to the production of
              numerous products, including radicals, however, the details of the mechanism
              are not well understood. Relative rate measurements will be carried out in a
              small quartz chamber with direct sampling of the gas mixture and mass
              spectrometric detection as well as GC/MS (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry)
              analysis of compounds with low volatility. These studies can be carried out at
              various temperatures. Studies of the reactions of some of the reaction products
              (pinonaldehyde, nopinone) themselves with OH are also planned. Absolute
              measurements of the rate coefficients will be carried out using the turbulent
              flow technique. The results of this study will improve our knowledge of the
              details of the oxidation mechanisms and will be valuable in determining the
              efficiency of these biogenic hydrocarbons in the production of photochemical
              smog.
