Abstract    :
              This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, addresses the effect of steps on electrocatalysis and
              electrodeposition on platinum single crystal electrode surfaces.  The
              electrooxidation of formic acid, and the deposition of Co/Pt magnetic
              multilayers form the main focus of this research carried out by Professor
              Hector D.  Abruna at Cornell University.  This work provides detailed insight
              into the relation between structure and function of electroactive metals in
              fuel cell and magnetic material applications. 

The detailed understanding of
              the connection between electrode surface structure and electrode chemical
              activity is the focus of this research project.  Using well-characterized
              stepped single crystal electrodes, small organic molecule reactions are being
              examined.  In addition, the use of these stepped surfaces as templates for the
              structured deposition of magnetic multilayers is explored in this work.  The
              results of these studies will provide fundamental insight into the behavior of
              electrocatalytic systems.
