	This proposal is to develop trace element partitioning as
              a tool to assist petrologists in the task of deciphering the metamorphic
              history of a terrane, and to apply this tool to further our understanding of
              Earth history. Detailed studies will be carried out on metapelites that have
              undergone partial melting (anatexis) and rocks that have undergone high P/T
              metamorphism in order to characterize fully the trace element zoning and
              partitioning in major and accessory phases.	 
	An empirical calibration of a
              monazite-xenotime thermometer will be augmented and enhanced to include the
              influence of HREE, Th and U on monazite YPO4 content, and procedures developed
              for the application of this thermometer to yield meaningful results.  Two
              additional thermometers, YAG-xenotime and YAG-monazite, will be similarly
              enhanced so that they are applicable over a wide range of conditions.
              Additional new, empirical thermometers based on yttrium partitioning between
              garnet and accessory minerals at high pressures will be explored
              
	Thermodynamic models of whole rock reactions and mineral composition
              variation will be developed to place accessory mineral paragenesis on a firm
              theoretical footing. The models will be used to make predictions about the
              involvement of accessory minerals in major phase reactions, and in the
              interpretation of natural parageneses observed in the study suites.
