Title: High-Resolution Studies of
              Complex Faulting: Chi-Chi, Taiwan Earthquake

In recent years, geologists and geophysicists have witnessed a
              revolution in the development and implementation of an array of new tools for
              measuring motions of the earth's crust, including global positioning
              satellites, interferometric synthetic aperture radar, and broadband digital
              seismic systems, allowing tremendous advances in motion detection accuracy. 
              Japan and Taiwan took the lead in the installation of these instruments, and
              the recent Chi-Chi, Taiwan earthquake (1999) sequence has produced a remarkable
              set of data.  Over 300 strong-motion acceleration records at distances less
              than 50 km are now available for the main event, Mw = 7.7.  Eleven aftershocks
              with local magnitudes greater than 6 occurred in the first week, several as
              large as Northridge.  About 10,000 digital 3-component waveforms can now be
              studied to answer questions about variation in rupture velocity, rise-time,
              nonlinear behavior, basin amplification, etc.  We plan to apply an assortment
              of newly developed analytical tools involving wavelet transforms, modified
              annealing, and Pseudo-Green's Functions to explore these new data.  In
              particular, we plan to fix the slip-histories or various sub faults using the
              static data and using calibrated seismic paths to constrain the rise-time and
              rupture velocity
