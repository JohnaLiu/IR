This is a collaborative project between Dr. G. Vaughn
              Griffiths, Colorado School of Mines, and Dr. Miguel Cerrolaza, Central
              University of Venezuela.

The  proposal is focussed on improving the accuracy
              and efficiency of engineering analysis software, specifically the finite
              element method, by exploiting the power of Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) to
              generate and simplify lengthy and complex algebraic expressions.  These will be
              output directly into a high level computer language, to produce a public domain
              library of routines that will benefit engineering practitioners and software
              developers.   

The interests of the collaborators complement each other with
              minimal overlap.  The priority of the US group resides in software development
              for classical elasticity, while the Venezuelan group has a particular interest
              in bio-engine applications, with both groups intending to replace traditional
              numerical integration of finite element matrices by closed form expressions.  
              
The outcome of this work will be a public-domain suite of subprograms that
              will be available to all developers and users of FE software.
