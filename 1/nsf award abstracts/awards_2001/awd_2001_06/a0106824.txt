Strong postseismic deformation continues today, more
              than 35 years after the 1964 Alaska earthquake. The objective of this research
              is to understand the physical mechanisms responsible for postseismic
              deformation and variations in plate coupling in the 1964 earthquake rupture
              area. The problem of understanding postseismic deformation cannot be separated
              from the problem of understanding the shallow seismogenic zone; we measure the
              sum of the two. For the postseismic deformation, the investigators aim to
              determine the relative importance of creep/afterslip and viscoelastic
              relaxation in explaining the present and cumulative postseismic observations.
              Is a combination of the two classes of mechanisms required to explain the
              observations? If so, what is their relative importance? For variations in plate
              coupling, they aim to delineate as well as possible where the boundaries
              between strongly and weakly coupled zones lie. How sharp are these boundaries?
              How well do they correspond to the asperities determined from the 1964 rupture?
              How does the complex velocity observed in Prince William Sound relate to the
              transition from subduction to collision of the Yakutat block? 

The
              investigators will carry out an integrated study of GPS observations, analysis
              of related geodetic data including leveling and tide gauge measurements, and
              development of numerical models of crustal deformation applicable to both the
              specific tectonic environment of southern Alaska and to subduction zones in
              general.  Continued measurements of crustal deformation in southern Alaska,
              combined with advanced dislocation and viscoelastic modeling, may allow the
              investigating team to unravel the physical mechanisms of postseismic
              deformation. The research will be a cooperative effort involving personnel from
              the Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska and the Geodynamics Branch,
              Laboratory for Terrestrial Physics, Goddard Space Flight Center.
