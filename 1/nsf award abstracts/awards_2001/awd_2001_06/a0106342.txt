Abstract    :
              Prof. George McLendon of the Department of Chemistry, Princeton University, is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              of the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work on
              developing a general protocol to synthesize de novo proteins of optimal
              stability. Kinetically inert metal/ligand systems will be used that allow
              stepwise resynthesis of the target assembly, and investigate the design by
              measuring thermodynamic folding parameters and by macromolecular structural
              analysis. The approach will be extended to select proteins that lend themselves
              to in vivo expression. Results from this study will lead to a greater
              understanding of the protein structure and folding through development of a
              novel technology, which will allow the design and expression of proteins of
              predictable function. 				

Results from this study will have a broad
              societal impact in such areas as catalysis in industrial processes and
              synthesis of drugs. Students and post-doctoral research associates will receive
              excellent training in a novel developing area of bioinorganic chemistry.
