	We have developed a new technology
              for direct imaging of P to S converted phases.  It builds on imaging concepts
              used in the oil and gas industry to directly image backscattered (reflected)
              seismic waves, but we utilize forward scattered P to S conversions produced by
              distant earthquakes instead of backscattered waves generated by artificial
              sources.  This allows us to directly manipulate raw recordings of distant
              earthquakes to produce an image of P to S scattering potential underneath a
              seismic array.  The mathematical model used is a form of inverse scattering
              appropriate for this type of wave interaction.  Applications of the technique
              to date have revealed the presence of previously unseen dipping boundaries that
              coincide with ancient suture zones within the continents.  Existing
              applications of the technique have been limited to 2D slices.  The proposed
              project would extend the capabilities of this technique to produce 3D images of
              P to S conversion structure beneath broadband arrays.  The technique will be
              applied to data from the recently completed array experiment in the Tien Shan
              of central Asia to address fundamental issues about the relation of mantle and
              crustal processes in continent-continent collision zones.  We also propose to
              apply this approach to new, dense broadband array data available in southern
              California.  This may provide new insights on the nature of flow in the upper
              mantle connected with the San Andreas fault system.
