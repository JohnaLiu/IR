The Dabie belt of east - central China exposes extensive
              areas of ultra high pressure rocks, and considerable resources have been
              expended in understanding how these rocks representing metamorphism that
              occurred at depths of 100 km or more, reached the surface.  This project seeks
              to add particularly to the subsurface data concerning these rocks by
              reprocessing a seismic line that was collected by the Chinese Geological Survey
              across the Dabie belt.  Results should improve the knowledge of the subsurface
              geometry of these rocks and aid in understanding their ascent.
