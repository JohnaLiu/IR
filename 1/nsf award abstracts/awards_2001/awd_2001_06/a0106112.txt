The timing and nature of
              accretion of the Carolina Zone to Laurentia is one of the more significant and
              least constrained tectonic problems in modern southern Appalachian geology. 
              The original suture has been overprinted and obliterated by subsequent
              Alleghanian motion along the western margin of the Carolina zone, precluding
              direct investigation of the suture.  The Gold Hill Shear Zone is a prominent
              feature in the western part of the Carolina Zone and may record features
              produced by the suturing event that have been preserved due to the distance of
              the shear zone back from the actual terrane margin.  The project involves an
              integrated structural and geochronologic study of the Gold Hill Shear Zone in
              an attempt to understanding timing, kinematics and crustal affinities of the
              original suture and collision of the Carolina Zone with Laurentia.  Results
              will help develop reconstruction of the Appalachians and their exotic
              terranes.
