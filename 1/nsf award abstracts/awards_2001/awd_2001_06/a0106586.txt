The northwestern Appalachians in New York, Vermont and
              Quebec experienced a complex geologic history. Mesoproterozoic collisional
              tectonics are recorded in rocks exposed in the Adirondack Mountains and as
              erosional windows in the Appalachians of New England. Subsequent rifting and
              development of an oceanic basin was followed by episodic Paleozoic convergence
              and accretion to the eastern edge of North America, forming the Appalachian
              chain. This was followed by Triassic-Jurassic extension and rifting resulting
              in the modern North Atlantic basin. Current knowledge of the lower continental
              crust and continental lithospheric mantle in this area is derived primarily
              from geophysical methods and studies of tectonically exhumed high pressure
              units. Upper-crustal and lower-mantle xenoliths in Cretaceous Monteregian dikes
              offer a unique glimpse into the northwestern Appalachian lithosphere. This
              study aims to determine the thermal, tectonic and geochemical evolution of
              rocks represented by these xenoliths. Petrography and geothermobarometry of the
              xenoliths will constrain the P-T history of the assemblages sampled by the
              dikes. Sm-Nd and Re-Os isotopic systematics of the crustal and mantle xenoliths
              will give the age of formation and of isolation from the convecting upper
              mantle. These constraints on the nature of the deep crust and lithospheric
              mantle will be applied to unravel questions about the evolution of the
              lithospheric mantle and lower crust during Appalachian deformation and
              accretion. The proposed Sm-Nd and Re-Os isotopic measurements represent a first
              for xenoliths from this area.
