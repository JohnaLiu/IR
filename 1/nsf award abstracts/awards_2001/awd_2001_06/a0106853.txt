Substantial advances have been made in recent years in the
              understanding of the geological evolution of several major North American and
              European 'pan-African' Neoproterozoic (750-550 million year old) terranes, but
              there is still a fundamental gap in the knowledge of 'pan-African' orogenic
              belt evolution in Africa itself.  Much of the uncertainty about the
              accretionary history of the African Neoproterozoic orogens stems from the
              limited database of reliable radiometric ages of structurally important units,
              combined with a lack of detailed modern kinematic analysis in these deformed
              regions.  These critical data are being collected by performing combined
              structural, uranium-lead geochronological, and neodymium-lead-hafnium isotopic
              analyses of one of the pivotal Neoproterozoic African orogens, the Anti-Atlas
              orogen of Morocco. Through a detailed structural analysis of the deformed rocks
              in the region, combined with high precision uranium-lead zircon age
              determinations, many significant questions about the accretionary history of
              the southern Anti-Atlas belt are being answered.  Such questions include the
              age and timing of obduction of ocean-floor crust (ophiolites), the relationship
              of these ophiolites to one another, the connections between arc-terranes to the
              north with ophiolites and an associated blueschist belt to the south, the age
              and nature of the basement of these terranes, the degree of interaction of
              basement with Neoproterozoic magmas, and the timing of accretion of these
              terranes to the West African Craton.  Through modern, multi-disciplinary
              studies the geological 'family-tree' of the circum-Atlantic terranes with the
              orogens surrounding the West African Craton is being established.
