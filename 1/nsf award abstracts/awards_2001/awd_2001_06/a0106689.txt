This project is a test of
              hypotheses regarding viscoelastic response, aseismic creep, and combinations of
              both processes following great earthquakes.  The collaborative effort, which
              will take place in Alaska, will make co-located absolute gravity observations
              (performed by scientists at the University of California, San Diego) and GPS
              observations (undertaken by scientists at the University of Alaska).  Different
              models of postseismic viscoelastic relaxation predict observable gravity
              changes over 1000 km length scales, with a complex spatial pattern. To date,
              the viscosity profile is best determined by postglacial rebound studies.
              Gravity and GPS measurements offer the opportunity to obtain viscosity profile
              estimates for the Alaskan plate boundary. The area is especially interesting,
              as the viscosity of subduction zone materials may be very different from that
              beneath the centers of continental and oceanic plates.  Aseismic creep is
              predicted to produce deformation of a more limited and markedly different
              spatial character than that of viscoelastic relaxation.  Determining the
              contribution of aseismic creep in postseismic deformation is important in
              estimating recurrence intervals for great earthquakes.  
This project will
              recover and re-measure previously established absolute gravity stations in
              Fairbanks and Palmer, Alaska.  The two stations are near the minimum and
              maximum predicted gravity change in the far-field for proposed viscosity
              models.  The measurements are also co-located with existing continuous GPS
              stations. Comparisons with prior data will be used to test the method, and to
              provide the basis for model testing.
