              ABSTRACT

Precise Age Calibration of the Late Pennsylvanian-Early Permian Time
              Scale: Implications for Global Correlation and Rates of Processes in the Late
              Paleozoic Era

The
              geologic time scale is a fundamental tool in Earth Science research -
              correlation of events globally, determination of absolute ages, and the
              estimation of rates of process all depend on the accuracy and precision of the
              time scale. This project will calibrate the Late Pennsylvanian through early
              Permian interval of the time scale through a combination of U-Pb zircon
              geochronology, stratigraphy, and multitaxa paleontology.  Work will focus on
              the marine sedimentary sections in the foreland of the southern Ural mountains
              in Russia-Kazakhstan, an area that offers a fantastic opportunity for time
              scale calibration because the late Paleozoic rocks have numerous,
              well-preserved fossils in addition to many interstratified volcanic ash
              horizons that are amenable to radiometric dating.
