Radioactive disequilibria in the 238U and 235U decay chains
              will be measured and interpreted for young volcanic rocks from several western
              Pacific island arcs (Marianas, Sangihe [Indonesia], and Japan). Specifically,
              disequilibria between 238U-230Th, 230Th-226Ra, and 235U-231Pa will be measured.
              Results will be integrated with other geochemical data to be obtained for the
              same rocks, especially trace element concentrations measured by ICPMS and
              Sr-Nd-Pb isotope ratios measured by TIMS. These supplemental can fingerprint
              components which may be in the source region of the magmas. Special attention
              will be placed on determining whether results constrain the physical processes
              of melting (such as the porosity, upwelling rate, and melt productivity of
              mantle in the wedge between the arc and underlying subducting lithosphere), as
              is the case in other major sites of planetary magmatism. Such processes are
              expected to differ in subduction zones where melting occurs by fluxing from
              subducted waters and may be much faster. The alternative is that the
              radioactive disequilibria are dominated by the source components too.  By
              comparing results from three quite different arcs, we will explore the role of
              different tectonic environments and source components.  Results for Japan will
              be integrated with seismic tomographic images of melting there, which are the
              best in the world, but it will also be necessary to work closely with Japanese
              colleagues familiar with the volcanoes being studied in order to take the local
              geological context fully into account. Results will be disseminated through a
              University of California K12 partnership program.
