This study
              involves the paleobiology and taphonomy (postmortem history) of two Early
              Cambrian Burgess Shale-type biotas from western Nevada and North Greenland. 
              The biotas, both from the Laurentian (North America-Greenland) paleocontinent,
              represent two of the oldest known assemblages of exceptionally preserved
              animals in the world.  These assemblages overlap in part the time of the
              Cambrian adaptive radiation of multicellular animals.  They provide important
              "windows" into the evolutionary history of the Early Cambrian, and they should
              provide information about the conditions under which exceptional preservation
              occurred.  The primary purposes of this work are: 1, to collect and document
              the biota of the new Nevada site and continue documentation of the biota of the
              Greenland site; 2, to document and interpret information about the taphonomy of
              the Nevada and Greenland sites; 3, to describe and interpret trace fossils
              associated with the body fossils; 4, to describe and interpret the
              stratigraphic and sedimentologic context of exceptional preservation in the
              Nevada and Greenland sites; and 5, to determine the biogeographic affinities of
              nonmineralized organisms present in the Early Cambrian biotas.  Completion of
              this work will provide important information about biologic diversity on the
              North America-Greenland paleocontinent prior to the terminal Early Cambrian
              extinction.  This, in turn, is expected to provide a strong basis for
              biogeographic comparison with Early Cambrian biotas of Gondwanan areas, and a
              basis for comparison with biotas from the Middle Cambrian of Laurentia.
