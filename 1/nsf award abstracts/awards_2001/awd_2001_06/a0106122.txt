Abstract    :
              This project is aimed at studying  physical properties of various soft condensed
              materials such as chiral-smectic liquid-crystal and bent-core compounds that
              display a large net electric polarization. In addition to experimentally
              determining the molecular azimuthal arrangements in the chiral-smectic variant
              phases, studies of physical properties of various new mesophases formed by
              bent-core molecules will be emphasized. Employing state-of-the-art optical
              systems, numerous important discoveries in these areas are now possible such as
              the characterization of mesophases formed by bent-core molecules. These
              experimental results will focus on fundamental studies of molecular packing in
              the various mesophases and provide theorists important physical parameters for
              theoretical modeling. Educational opportunities will be developed to train both
              undergraduate and graduate students in designing and constructing cutting-edge
              optical systems as well as acquiring, analyzing and understanding high quality
              experimental data. 

The desire for high-speed liquid crystal displays and a
              new interest in special materials to be used in optic fiber networks makes the
              characterization of exotic liquid crystal phases for such applications has
              critically important. Students trained in these areas will be highly
              competitive in the job market.
