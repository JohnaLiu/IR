This research will investigate deformation mechanisms in
              quartzo-feldspathic rocks with the aim of enhancing our understanding of
              deformation history of the crust as well as to facilitate accurate modeling of
              the stress levels and stain partitioning in different tectonic settings.  The
              investigators will work on 3 research projects.  First they will complete an
              experimental calibration of the recrystallized grain size piezometer for the 3
              recrystallization mechanisms and corresponding dislocation creep regimes
              previously identified in quartz, and will test them with application to a
              natural shear zone which spanned a wide temperature range including all 3
              regimes.  Second, they will complete an experimental study of the processes by
              which a relatively small amount of weak mica in a quartza-feldspathic aggregate
              becomes interconnected and dispersed, leading to profound strain weakening and
              localization into ductile shear zones.  Third, they will complete a
              reconnaissance experimental study of the variation in deformation mechanisms
              and strength across the plagioclase solid solution series.  Based on that study
              the investigators will choose 2 or 3 key compositions for further stepping
              experiments in a molten salt assembly to determine flow law parameters.
