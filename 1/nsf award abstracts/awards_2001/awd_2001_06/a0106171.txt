              Abstract
Pilot Study: Carbon Isotope Composition of Aptian Plant Fossils from
              the Arundel Formation, Western Maryland 
A. Hope Jahren, Johns Hopkins

Current literature reflects interest in a new potential player in
              the carbon cycle: methane hydrates are solids composed of methane and water
              that result from bacterial activity in marine sediments. In order to assess the
              importance of methane hydrates in long-term global climate, we propose to study
              the biogeochemical consequences of a methane release event during the early
              Aptian (~117 million years ago). Toward this, we will obtain a carbon-isotope
              record of plant fossils from sequences located within the Arundel Formation
              (within the Potomac Group) of Western Maryland. This record will be compared
              with a record recently obtained from terrestrial sediments from Colombia, South
              America, which shows a dramatic change in carbon isotope value during the early
              Aptian (~117 Ma).
