Title: Coda Wave
              Interferometry

PI's: Roelof Snieder and John Scales, Colorado School of
              Mines

In this project new technique is developed that uses multiple
              scattered waves as a sensitive tool for detecting changes in the Earth. This
              technique is called ``Coda Wave Interferometry'' because the Earth acts as an
              interferometer for the multiple-scattered coda waves. In this technique the
              changes in coda waves due to changes in the Earth are used to monitor minute
              changes in the Earth.

In this project the technique will be applied to (i)
              laboratory measurements of ultrasonic waves (ii) the waveforms recorded on a
              volcano using an air-gun as seismic source and (iii) the changes in a reservoir
              in which brine is injected.

Coda Wave Interferometry can have a significant
              impact of different areas of the geosciences as well as in other fields of
              science and technology. Potential applications include dam-monitoring,
              monitoring of landslides, detecting deformation of faults zones, and measuring
              changes in the amount of fracturing in reservoirs. The technique can
              potentially also be used for non-destructive testing applications. Coda Wave
              Interferometry can also play an important role in industrial geophysics because
              it can be used to monitor the change in hydrocarbon reservoirs during enhanced
              recovery operations.
