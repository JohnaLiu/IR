Strike-slip faulting clearly dominates the western margin of
              the Tibetan plateau, and thrust and normal faulting dominates the southern
              margin, but how these two systems interact is unclear.  This has led to two
              distinct classes of models, one emphasizing orogen-parallel strike-skip
              faulting and the other emphasizing southward extrusion of Tibetan crust along
              the southern margin.  This project will examine the timing and kinematics of
              the Karakoram fault system and other faults in the juncture between the western
              and southern margins of the Tibetan Plateau in order to discriminate between
              the viable models.  Results should clarify the role that strike-slip faulting
              may play in controlling the dynamics of the southern margin of Tibet in the
              High Himalaya of Nepal.
