The experimental measurement of the low-frequency
              attenuation behavior of polycrystalline olivine, of olivine-orthopyroxene and
              of olivine-based partial melts is the practical emphasis of this research.   Of
              theoretical focus is a new hypothesis concerning the physical mechanism(s) and
              significance of the "high-temperature background" mechanical absorption,
              specifically, that this absorption relates to the diffusion-effected
              relaxations of grain and solid-state phase boundaries and particularly of
              (deformation-induced) subgrain boundaries.  The physical implication, then, is
              that a small-amplitude, oscillatory variation in stress, one that is added to a
              nominally constant differential stress that is effecting dislocation creep in a
              material, is "sampling" the deformation-induced microstructure, specifically
              the network of subgrains.  If this hypothesis is correct--and discerning this
              correctness is the long-range goal of the experimental work--one can envision
              an effective way to do attenuation-based "geophysical prospecting" of active
              tectonic regions, e.g., for levels of differential stress and, perhaps, strain,
              with a calibration based on laboratory experiments.  Experiments in this
              (one-year) funding period will emphasize dynamic ("sub-resonant" oscillatory
              loading) and quasi-static (constant loading, i.e., creep), high-resolution
              torsional mechanical responses of carefully engineered aggregates of
              (ferromagnesian) olivine and of two-phase solid olivine-orthopyroxene. These
              will be studied as functions of (i) temperature (1150-1350 degC), (ii)
              frequency (10^[-4]-1 Hz) and (iii) grain size (5-20 micrometers; fine enough
              that [a] thermal-expansion-anisotropy effected grain/phase boundary cracking
              cannot occur and [b] [for the levels of differential stress employed] lattice
              dislocations are not nucleated in the course of mechanical testing).  In
              addition, benchmarking deformation experiments, comparing the high-resolution
              ambient-pressure measurements with the mechanical response of the same material
              under a confining pressure of  ~300 MPa will be performed.
