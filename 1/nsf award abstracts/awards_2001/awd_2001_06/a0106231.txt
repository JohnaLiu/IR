Abstract    :
              This is a study of scalar fluctuations in turbulent jet flames.  Spatial and
              temporal structures are studied in a simplified counterflow geometry.  The
              geometry is conducive to direct comparison between quantitative experimental
              results and advanced turbulent combustion models such as large-eddy
              simulations.  A modular burner consisting of two opposed jets and providing a
              range of turbulent flow conditions is used.  Quantitative laser diagnostics are
              applied to a series of flames in this burner to recover the time dependence of
              OH and CH concentrations, temperature, and mixture fraction.  Velocity
              measurements are obtained on an identical burner at Technische Universitat
              Darmstadt.  A set of simultaneous velocity and concentration measurements are
              made at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.  Using a simulation technique
              developed by the investigators, relationships between spatial and temporal
              correlations are examined quantitatively.

Time-series measurements of
              concentrations of minor species in turbulent jet flames have been made
              recently.  These single-point measurements permit study of time-scale
              statistics and are analogous to spatial-scale imaging.  However, unknown mixing
              statistics in the jet flames complicate interpretation of these data.
