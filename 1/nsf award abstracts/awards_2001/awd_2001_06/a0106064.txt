The PI proposes to adapt the
              divergence-free wavelet-based dynamical model for the simulation of a turbulent
              channel flow.  The main goals are (1) to investigate how effective wavelets are
              in describing the coherent structure in the near wall region of turbulent
              channel flow, (2) to use wavelet bases to construct a low-dimensional
              dynamical-system representation for the near-wall region, and (3) to compare
              the wavelet and POD-Fourier representations of the coherent structure.
