Surface deformation at subduction zones is generally
              interpreted in terms of movement on the thrust boundary between the subducting
              slab and the overriding plate.  Elastic half-space dislocation (EHSD) models
              are frequently used to infer a slip distribution on the fault from surface
              geodetic observations and seismic hazard is evaluated in terms of which
              portions of the fault are fully or partially locked.  These models are
              appealing because of their simplicity, but the assumption that all surface
              deformation is due to movement on a fault embedded in a homogeneous elastic
              half-space leads to some unrealistic behavior.  Rather than considering the
              entire system, this project will consider only the portion of the overriding
              plate that behaves elastically over the time period of interest. Surface
              deformation occurs as a result of stress changes or rates applied along the
              thrust fault boundary and along the base of a finite elastic region (the
              overriding plate).  This approach offers a more promising means of
              understanding the physics of subduction zones and makes fewer implicit
              assumptions than do EHSD models.  Inversion results using this method will be
              compared and contrasted with those using EHSD models.  The investigators will
              initially examine the Cascadia subduction zone in Oregon and Washington, and
              the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska.  Additional study areas will include Japan,
              Sumatra, the Himalayas, and New Zealand.  The results of this study should have
              important implications in fault friction studies and earthquake hazard
              research, and in understanding plate driving and resistive forces.
