The proposed research focusses on the Orunaui rhyolitic
              ash-flow tuff, a geologically young and contrasting counterpart to the Bishop
              Tuff. We plan to test whether the preeruptive Oruanui magma was stably
              stratified.  If the unsystematically erupted Oruanui pumice compositions
              nevertheless derive from a density stratified magma body, then the case will be
              strengthened that many big bodies of silicic magma probably achieve a stable
              density stratification by natural processes of magma formation, emplacement,
              crystallization and exsolution of gas. We will study the preeruptive state of
              the magma by studying inclusions and reentrants of glass in quartz and other
              phenocrysts, because these plausibly preserve a record of the preeruptive
              conditions, little modified by eruptive decompression, gas exsolution and
              crystallization. Our study will help understand the formation of silicic
              planetary crusts as well as the behavior of active bodies of silicic magma
              including their propensity for eruption and interactions with geothermal
              systems, which are sites of ore deposition and energy production.
