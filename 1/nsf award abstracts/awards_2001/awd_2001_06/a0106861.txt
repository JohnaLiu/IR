The style, magnitude and timing of Tertiary deformation in the
              central Tibet Plateau remain poorly known, but such information is central to
              discriminating among the various models for the origin of plateaus.  Subsurface
              data is required to document accurately the amount of shortening and other
              parameters.  A series of seismic lines have been obtained by the China National
              Star Petroleum Corporation and these data have been made available for this
              project.  Reprocessing and interpreting these data are expected to greatly
              improve understanding of Tertiary deformation on the Tibet Plateau.
