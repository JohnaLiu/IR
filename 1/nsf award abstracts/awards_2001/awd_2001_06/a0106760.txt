Title: 	Cognitive Styles and Individual Differences in Imagery
              

Award Abstract


This is a study of cognitive styles (such as the
              visualizer-verbalizer distinction) people (both students and professionals) use
              in thinking through and learning science and mathematics (specifically in the
              topic area of kinematics).  The project has two goals:  (1) To investigate and
              revise the traditional verbalizer-visualizer cognitive style dimension,
              including the possibility that more than these two basic styles exist (such as
              object and spatial visual styles). This  approach is based on findings and
              methods from cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience to conceptualize
              the nature of cognitive style and its neural underpinnings.   (2) To examine
              the instructional implications of these cognitive styles and their relevance to
              educational practice.  The research will proceed along three lines:  behavioral
              studies, classroom-based studies, and functional magnetic resonance imaging
              (fMRI).  Based on evidence from this research, the investigators will develop
              theoretically-based guidelines for teaching students to process
              visually/spatially and materials which build on the specific strengths of each
              type of thinker.
