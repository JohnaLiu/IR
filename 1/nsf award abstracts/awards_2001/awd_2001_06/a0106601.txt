Abstract    :
              The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) for Polar Marine Sciences is seeking
              partial support of participants to attend its 3 rd GRC, "Field Analyses and
              Numerical Modeling of Coupled Physical/Chemical and Biological Systems", March
              11-16, 2001, in Ventura, California. The conference will provide a great
              opportunity for cutting-edge presentations and lively discussion of ideas in
              predictive system dynamics that at the forefront of polar marine science. The
              scientific program has been developed to foster strong controversy in a
              friendly environment and, hopefully, open minds about other or new
              possibilities to explore. The conference will be useful for the training of new
              polar scientists and the planning for polar research programs that impact on
              the polar environment and global change issues relating to these polar
              environments.
