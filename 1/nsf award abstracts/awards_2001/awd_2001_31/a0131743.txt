What happens in our brains when we learn? 
              How do evolutionary changes in mechanisms underlying one form of learning
              impact upon the evolution of other forms of learning?  In previous research
              this investigator used neurophysiological and behavioral studies of several
              present-day species (related to the popular models species, Aplysia
              californica) with known relationships to each other to establish that
              fundamental mechanisms of sensitization, a simple form of learning, have
              changed across evolution.  In this research the consequences of evolution will
              be examined with respect to a more complex form of learning, classical
              conditioning.  The hypothesis to be examined is whether loss or reduction in
              the simple mechanisms of sensitization reduces the persistence of the more
              complex neural changes underlying classical conditioning.  This study will lead
              to a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms of learning and memory.
