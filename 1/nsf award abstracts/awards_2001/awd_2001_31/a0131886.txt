With entre provided by Organization of
              American States (OAS), the US research team will collaborate with researchers
              from universities in Belize, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic.  The domain is
              drug interdiction, under an arm or the OAS - the Inter-American Drug Abuse
              Control Commission.  Under the COmmission, member states of OAS collect, share
              and analyze information in standard ways.  Within this context, research will
              be undertaken in the areas of spoken dialogue systems, data management and
              security for rule-based data sharing and filtering, information retrieval and
              machine translation, middleware to support these transnational information
              grids, and network behavior modeling for acceptable quality of service.
