Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Georgia will
              acquire a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to
              carry out studies on a) probing cellular function with small molecules and
              light (Dore); b) assessment of binding affinity and selectivity of anion
              receptors; characterization of new organic materials; structure-relaxivity
              studies of porphyrin dendrimers (Johnson); c) total synthesis of biologically
              active natural products (Majetich); d) enzyme reaction mechanisms and kinetics
              (Phillips); e) synthesis and structural organometallic chemistry (Robinson);
              and f) alkane activation and metal-free supramolecular catalysis.  

Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
              identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms
              within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules
              in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
              studies will have an impact in a number of areas including biochemistry and the
              development of new catalysts and novel materials.
