Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Arizona State
              University will acquire a Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization - Time of
              Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometer.  This instrument will facilitate research
              in a number of areas: a) the synthesis of organic compounds, including large
              porphyrin-based complexes; b) characterization of intermediates and products
              involved in the biosynthesis of the glycosylated carotenoid myxoxanthophyll; c)
              characterization of proteins that have undergone posttranslational
              modifications; d) characterization of synthetic DNA binding polypeptides; and
              e) proteomics study on extracellular enzymes that degrade phenolic comopounds. 
              

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF)
              mass spectrometry is the technique of choice for obtaining accurate molecular
              weights on molecules up to and over 300,000 daltons, with extremely high
              sensitivity.  Use of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer has therefore become a
              standard technique in most DNA/protein core facilities.  The ability to obtain
              very accurate molecular weights of biomolecules is fundamental to all
              biological and biomedical research and essential in a modern research and
              training environment.
