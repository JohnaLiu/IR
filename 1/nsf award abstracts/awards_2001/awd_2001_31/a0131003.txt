Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University
              of Colorado in Boulder will acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment
              will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) the mechanism, design,
              synthesis and evaluation of anti-cancer drugs involving DNA cross-linking
              (Koch); b) new "naked" and extremely reactive cations of a variety of elements,
              and studies of fluorinated bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (Michl); c) organic
              synthesis, including glycopeptides and glycoproteins, and derivatized
              structural analogs (Halcomb); d) organic synthesis involving a new class of
              catalysts for accomplishing hydroxyl-directed reactions (Sammakia); e) the
              design and characterization of nanostructured solid-state organic materials
              (Gin); and f) fundamental structural, spectroscopic and mechanistic
              investigations of metalloenzymes (Hagadorn).     

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. 
              Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including biochemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry
              and catalysis.
