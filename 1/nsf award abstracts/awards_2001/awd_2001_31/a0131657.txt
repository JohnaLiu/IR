The Notch signaling pathway
              represents a conserved mechanism of cell communication.  During the development
              of C. elegans there are multiple events in which the Notch signaling pathway
              plays a critical role in cell fate induction.  Our work focuses on two newly
              identified components of Notch signaling events, the C. elegans aph-1 and aph-2
              gene products.  Previous work has shown that the aph-1 and aph-2 genes encode
              novel proteins that are well conserved in other systems, including humans;
              however, their function in Notch signaling events remains unknown. The primary
              objective of this proposal is to examine the roles of the APH-1 and APH-2
              proteins in facilitating cell-cell interactions. To this end three general
              areas of investigation will be pursued.  First, a series of experiments will be
              carried out to delineate where in the Notch signaling pathway the APH-1 and
              APH-2 proteins function.  Which cells require APH-1 and APH-2 activity, and is
              their function required before or after receptor interaction with its ligand? 
              The methods will include analysis of APH-1 cellular and subcellular expression
              patterns, manipulation of individual embryonic cells, and genetic epistasis
              analysis.  Second, we will use standard mapping and cloning procedures to
              pursue the molecular identity of four new genes that were previously isolated
              as genetic suppressors of an aph-1 mutation.  Because mutations in these genes
              can compensate for defective APH-1 activity, elucidation of their molecular
              identity will shed light on the normal function of APH-1, as well as identify
              potential new players of Notch-mediated events.  Third, an exploration into
              post-embryonic roles for APH-1 and APH-2 will be initiated by examining
              post-embryonic mutant phenotypes, genetic interactions with other Notch pathway
              components, and an analysis of post-embryonic APH-1 expression patterns.
              Because APH-1 and APH-2 are found in other systems, it is expected that results
              from this study will contribute to the general understanding of Notch signaling
              in all species.
