A National Center for Digital Government:  Integrating
              Information and Institutions

This award will support the initial development
              of a social, political, and policy research center on the topic of government
              enabled by information technologies.  Initial research will begin in two areas:
               i) institutional analysis (how information technologies are brought into
              government and affect the organization and its modes of operation, in
              particular across multiple agencies), and ii) policy networks as informational
              and deliberative structures.
Other elements of the award will support the
              center aspects of the proposal to draw in and support the formation of a
              research community.  These elements include a Doctoral Fellows program, support
              for graduate students, seminars, workshops, and other forms of outreach.
