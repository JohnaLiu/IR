Abstract    :
              Processes of sexual selection include competition, generally between males, and
              mate choice, typically by females.  In the latter, discriminating females may
              obtain from males 1) direct, material benefits that influence their survival
              and fecundity and/or 2) indirect, genetic benefits that are only expressed in
              the subsequent generation.  Female choice based on genetic benefits requires
              that genetic variance for the chosen male character(s), and the female
              preference, exist, but the directional selection imposed by female choice
              should eliminate such variance.  To determine how this paradox may be resolved
              in natural populations, the investigator will study mating behavior of the
              lesser waxmoth, a species in which males attract females with an ultrasonic
              advertisement signal.  Previous studies demonstrated substantial genetic
              variance for the male signal and suggested that a genetic tradeoff exists
              between signal attractiveness and development rate.  The current project will
              use inbred lines and quantitative genetic techniques to evaluate the extent of
              this tradeoff and how it may maintain genetic variance in male
              attractiveness.

This study will contribute to our basic knowledge of
              acoustic signaling and perception and how these behaviors are related to life
              history and development.  Moreover, analyses of the inbred lines will reveal
              the genetic relationships between sexual and developmental traits and how
              genetic correlation may influence the expression of behavior and its
              variation.
