Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II Project will establish
              market demand for a novel electrically mediated leveling technology and
              position the technology for market launch via a joint venture. The specific
              Phase II objectives are: 1. Scale-up and demonstration of the electrically
              mediated process on eight inch wafers, 2. Development of a process library for
              feature sizes 1-5 down to 0.17 microns, and lower, and 3. Design of a "proof of
              concept" plating tool.   Preliminary concept design of a plating tool
              incorporating the electrically mediated process will be performed by an outside
              firm.  
     The sustainable competitive advantage associated with the project
              for leveling is cost.  Minimal overplate will eliminate or minimize the need
              for chemical/mechanical planarization (CMP) by reducing the copper waste slurry
              compared to the state-of-the-art copper metallization processes.  This in turn
              would eliminate the associated control, environmental, and cost issues.
