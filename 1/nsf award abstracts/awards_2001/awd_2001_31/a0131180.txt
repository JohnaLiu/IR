Abstract    :
              The objective of this research by Professor John E. Bercaw at the California
              Institute of Technology, which is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and
              Oganometallic Chemistry Program, is to develop new, highly reactive enantiopure
              precatalysts that show improved selectivity and substrate generality for chiral
              alpha-olefins.  Due to their extreme activities in polymerizing alpha-olefins,
              optically active ansa-zirconocene polymerization catalysts are excellent
              prospects for effecting kinetic resolutions, preferentially polymerizing one
              enantiomer of a chiral olefin and leaving behind the less reactive enantiomer. 
              This not only resolves the two enantiomers, but also leads to a new class of
              optically active polymers.

New catalysts will be developed to resolve right-
              and left handed molecules, which is essential for synthesizing chiral molecules
              such as pharmaceuticals.  By using a polymerization catalyst, one type of
              "handed" molecule is incorporated into a new type of "handed" polymer.
