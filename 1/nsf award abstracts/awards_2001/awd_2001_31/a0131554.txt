Digital Government:  Analysis of Barriers to Local Government
              Adoption of Digital Government and Strategies to Overcome the Barriers

This
              is a proposal to explore the uptake of IT by local government, in particular
              the provision of transactions and services over the Web, and identify solutions
              to hurdles which are found.  Focus groups will be established consisting of
              local government Chief of Information Officers, Mayors and other elected and
              appointed individuals.  This project is in collaboration with the Office of
              Telecommunications and Information Applications of the National
              Telecommunications and Information Administration, part of the US Department of
              Commerce.
