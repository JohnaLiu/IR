Digital
              Government:  Data Confidentiality, Data Quality, and Data Integration for
              Federal Databases: Foundations to Software Prototypes

This award will
              support research in data confidentiality, data quality, and data integration. 
              Prototypes will be built which can scale to operate on large sets of Federally
              held data.  Researchers will partner with several large Federal Government
              statistical agencies.  This topic is of particular importance given the balance
              of these agencies must strive for, in terms of their dual missions to collect
              and keep private confidential data, while at the same time making that data
              accessible for research and policy issues.  This grant will support a
              multi-disciplinary multi-institution team, with participants from five
              universities, one non-profit, and one national laboratory.  The disciplines
              represented include computer science, statistical science, and systems
              engineering.
