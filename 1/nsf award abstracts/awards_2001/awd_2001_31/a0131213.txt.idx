Abstract    :
              A workshop on "Embedded Software" was held October 8-10, 2001, in Tahoe City,
              California.  The purpose of the workshop was to incubate a research community
              in embedded software.  There were 35 invited presentations at the workshop,
              with national and international speakers from both academia and industry.  The
              presentations covered all aspects of embedded software, including operating
              systems and middleware, programming languages and compilers, modeling and
              validation, software engineering and programming methodologies, scheduling and
              execution time analysis, communication protocols and fault tolerance.
