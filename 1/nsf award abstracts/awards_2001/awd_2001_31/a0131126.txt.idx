Abstract    :
              The objective is the joint effort of the National Science Foundation Directorate
              for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and the Defense
              Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Information Technology Office (ITO)
              to establish a National Experimental Platform for Hybrid and Embedded Systems
              Technology (NEPHEST).  The Goal of NEPHEST is to provide a common
              experimental infrastructure for hybrid and embedded systems research.  NEPHEST
              will include the following major components:  1. An open framework for
              integrating hardware and software components of both laboratory and large-scale
              experiments for hybrid and embedded systems research. 2. Reusable hardware and
              software components and tools for experimental systems. 3. An evolving suite
              of challenge problems, reference solutions, and baselines for validation and
              verification of technologies. 4. A National Repository of components, tools,
              verification results and documents.
