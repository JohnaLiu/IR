Abstract    :
                 Marine cone snails of the genus Conus are predators that paralyze their prey
              by injecting potent neurotoxins.  These toxins are peptides (11-45 amino acids
              long) that target ion channels crucial for normal electrochemical activity in
              nerve and muscle cells.  A novel toxin has been discovered in one species,
              Conus californicus, which is a non-selective predator on worms, snails and
              fish.  This toxins blocks nerve transmission by targeting voltage-gated sodium
              channels.  This project uses biochemical, biophysical, and molecular approaches
              to elucidate the chemical structure of this peptide toxin, its mechanism of
              action, and its specificity profile, and to localize and clarify the basic
              biology of the venom production in this animal.  
    Results will be
              important in developing a new experimental reagent for basic research on
              channels, and in understanding how different toxic peptides are made and used
              by these snails in a biologically relevant context.  This lab also will
              continue important multi-disciplinary training of undergraduates in
              neuroscience.
