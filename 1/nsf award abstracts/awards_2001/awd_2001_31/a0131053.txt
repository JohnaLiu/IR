Abstract    :
              Natural history collections are a resource for research on the taxonomy and
              systematics of organisms.  Specimens and the associated data are now used in
              studies of ecology, conservation and environmental biology.  Much of the museum
              data lacks geo-referenced collection locations, such as map coordinates or
              latitude and longitude.  It is estimated that the number of specimens in US
              collections alone exceeds 750 million.  Usually, the collection location is
              recorded as a string of text that describes the location as position along a
              road and/or distance from a town or other point of reference.  Capture map
              coordinates from these text descriptions is tedious and time consuming.  In
              this activity, a suite of software tools will be developed that will enable the
              biological collection community to geo-reference quickly all of the locality
              data associated with their collections.  A prototype system, using a
              pattern-matching algorithm to break down the text string, has been developed. 
              Available place names in a database are associated with latitude and longitude
              coordinates.  When place-name data are missing, a database of other
              geographically-referenced information is compiled and used.  The tools will
              also include visualization, correction and error estimation features for more
              precise location and updates to the database.
