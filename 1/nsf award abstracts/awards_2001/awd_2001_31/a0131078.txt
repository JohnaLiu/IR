Abstract    :
              Understanding the relationship between plant traits and plant performance is a
              fundamental goal of both basic and applied plant sciences.  This research will
              determine the relationship between plant traits and performance (survival and
              reproductive output) for a wild sunflower species of hybrid origin (Helianthus
              anomalous) and early generation hybrids of its ancestral parents (Helianthus
              annuus and Helianthus petiolaris).  We are interested in plant traits related
              to water use, photosynthetic carbon gain, growth, survival, and reproductive
              output.  The hybrid species complex provides a unique opportunity to look at
              how these traits are evolving to improve the fitness of the hybrids in a desert
              dune environment, and what trait combinations are associated with maximum
              performance in this water and nutrient limited environment.  The analyses will
              include a) experimental gardens to show which plants do best in environments on
              and off the dunes, b) phenotypic selection experiments to determine which
              traits account for better performance, and c) selection experiments to
              determine whether or not there is heritable genetic variation for these traits
              in Helianthus.  This research will further our understanding of how wild plants
              adapt to harsh environments and identify traits that may be useful for
              development of stress tolerant line of commercial Helianthus annuus.
