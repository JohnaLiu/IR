Abstract    :
              H. Berny Schlegel is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
              Program to carry out computational program developments and applications of ab
              initio classical trajectory calculations.  Methodological improvements include
              Car-Parrinello-based density matrix propagation, Born-Oppenheimer trajectories,
              and reaction-path following techniques.  Specific research areas include
              organic light-emitting diode materials, molecules with nanotubes, and chemical
              vapor deposition.  

This research will expand the range of applicability of
              electronic structure methods to problems of current interest, such as stability
              issues in organic light-emitting diode materials being readied for marketing
              and control issues in chemical vapor deposition processes that produce
              industrial coatings.
