Mammalian implantation is an essential step during early
              embryonic development and involves the synchronization of endocrine, paracrine,
              and cellular events which confers uterine receptivity to the early embryo. 
              However, very little is known about the molecular interactions between
              implanting blastocysts and the hormonally primed uterus.  Two maternally
              expressed AbdominalB-like homeobox genes, Hoxa-10 and Hoxa-11, have been
              implicated in the preparation and functioning of the implanting uterus.  Mice
              deficient for Hoxa-10 exhibit reduced female fertility due to defects in the
              uterine stroma to confer uterine receptivity.  Molecularly, Hoxa-10 functions
              in a hormonally regulated pathway and likely converges with another
              implantation pathway involving prostaglandin E2 and its receptors.  In
              addition, both Hoxa-10 and its neighboring gene Hoxa-11 have been shown to be
              required for hormone-mediated stromal cell proliferation during implantation. 
              Collectively, these results place Hoxa-10 and Hoxa-11 at the top of a
              hormone-regulated implantation pathway and suggest that these two genes may be
              responsible for many hormone-induced physiological changes.

This grant
              proposes to test the current model, first by demonstrating in site-specific
              knockout mice that progesterone directly regulate Hoxa-10 and Hoxa-11 gene
              expression in vivo during implantation through the two putative progesterone
              response elements.  Second, Dr. Ma will search for candidate target genes
              controlled by these two transcription factors, with special focus on cell cycle
              regulatory factors which could mediate hormone-induced cellular proliferation
              in the implantation uterus.  Results from these experiments should contribute
              substantially to the understanding of the implantation process and will start
              the process of building a genetic pathway controlling mammalian implantation.
