Abstract    :
              Previous research conducted under NSF support (DMR-9871450) resulted in
              well-defined organic/inorganic hybrid materials such as block and graft
              copolymers with poly(dimethylsiloxane), POSS containing homopolymers and block
              copolymers, and well-defined organic polymers tethered to curved and flat
              surfaces.  These materials were prepared by controlled radical polymerization
              (CRP) processes, primarily using atom transfer radical polymerization
              (ATRP).

While various methods to incorporate organic polymers to
              inorganic substrates have been reported, robust methods to universally
              incorporate well-defined (co)polymers are highly desirable.  The versatility of
              ATRP is a significant advantage to prepare hybrids, as facile functionalization
              of inorganic substrates can be performed to enable introduction of well-defined
              (co)polymers to these materials.  The potential of such an approach is far
              reaching to researchers involved in synthesis of polymers, colloids,
              nanocomposites and modification of flat surfaces.  The primary strategy is to
              covalently bond well-defined organic homopolymer and block copolymers to
              inorganic substrates (i.e., polymers, particles, surfaces) enabling precise
              interfacial control between organic and inorganic components.  In particular,
              block copolymers of varying composition and molar mass will be combined with
              inorganic substrates using CRP techniques.  Hybrid nanocomposites of increasing
              structural complexity will be prepared by utilizing the self-assembly
              properties of incompatible block copolymers attached to inorganic materials.
