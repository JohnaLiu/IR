Abstract    :
              EIA-0131905 -James Clark-Duke University-BDEI: Computation and Uncertainty in
              Ecological Forecasting.

Planning for global change and decision making will
              be improved by access to reliable forecasts of ecosystem change. A recent
              initiative by the Ecological Society of America identifies three challenges
              that must be met for forecasts to be successful: 1) computational approaches
              (algorithm development and data structures) that would permit simulation of
              complex systems, 2) feasible methods to track statistical uncertainty, and 3)
              data inadequacy.

 The project "BDEI: Computation and uncertainty in
              ecological forecasting" is an incubation that addresses these three challenges
              with an integrated approach. We propose to develop new computational and
              statistical techniques that will provide the capacity to forecast at broader
              spatial and temporal extents than possible with current approaches. The success
              of the proposed techniques will be evaluated using the data gathered from field
              experiments. 

A team of three researchers-an ecologist (Clark), a computer
              scientist (Agarwal), and a statistician (Lavine)- propose a working group for
              Fall and Spring 2002 that will focus on forecasting forest compositional
              change.  The working group will integrate new computational techniques into
              stand simulators and use models to estimate
uncertainty. The working group
              will develop an agenda for a broad initiative in ecological forecasting as
              basis for future proposals.
