Abstract    :
                 Neuropeptides are compounds in the nervous system that often modulate
              physiological functions, and so act as hormones.  The insect neuropeptide
              allatotropin (AT) is synthesized by specific cells in the central and enteric
              nervous systems, and is known to promote the synthesis of juvenile hormone
              (JH), but also has been implicated in other functions.  Recently three other
              allatotropin-like neuropeptides, ATL I, II and III have been discovered,
              encoded by alternative splicing from AT gene expression.  The mRNA for these
              splice variants shows specificity in the tissue and the stage of development,
              and the gene expression also appears to be under physiological control.  This
              project combines molecular, biochemical and physiological approaches to clarify
              when and where the different mRNAs encocde the unique peptides.  Results will
              provide information on the mechanisms to precisely control the overall
              biological response that results from the expression of a single neuropeptide
              gene that is an important regulatory molecule in a model insect species.
  
              The scientific impact will extend beyond insect neuroendocrinology to more
              general regulatory physiology, and potentially to insect pest control.  The
              infrastructure impact includes cross-disciplinary postdoctoral training, which
              will be enhanced by the collaborative team approach.
