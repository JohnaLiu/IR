Abstract    :
              Lay abstract

	Memory is generally believed to involve alterations in the ease
              with which neurons communicate with one another across synapses.  These
              alterations in turn are made possible by the production of proteins under the
              guidance of genes.  A major impediment to the identification of the relevant
              genes is the lack of information about which neurons and synapses are involved.
              In the case of memory formed by fear conditioning, the crucial synapses are
              believed to be in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala.  	Armed with this
              information, it should be possible to use the recently developed microarray
              technique to screen genes that are activated during memory formation.  This
              approach, when combined with another recently developed tool, laser captured
              microdissection, should provide a powerful means for probing gene expression in
              specific cells in the amygdala that change during memory formation.  The
              findings may also be relevant to other forms of memory subserved by other brain
              regions since existing data indicate that common molecular pathways are
              involved in different forms of learning and memory.
