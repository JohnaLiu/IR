Abstract    :
              Professor Kathy Rowlen of the University of Colorado-Boulder is funded by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to use confocal microscopy and
              nonlinear spectroscopy to study thin organic films.  The goal is to learn how
              thin films deposit on surfaces.  Three experiments are being performed:  the
              optical properties of films from sub-monolayer to multilayer will be measured,
              the spatial resolution of second harmonic generation and other optical methods
              will be increased, and "dip-pen-nanolithography" is used for producing well
              defined nanopatterns of optically interesting dyes.  Optical microscopy is
              required rather than average measurements because inhomogeneities on the
              nanoscale can govern orientations and domain growth of thin films. 

Such
              studies are required to understand the deposition of oligonucleotides and
              proteins which are used for microarrays and lab-on-a-chip formats.  Fundamental
              research on film deposition serves as an example of how basic research in
              chemistry can enable advances in human health.  The students will learn both
              measurement considerations and surface science.
