Abstract    :
              EIA-0131281 Bergen, Kathleen University of Michigan - Ann Arbor   BDEI:
              Radar Remote Sensing of Habitat Structure for Biodiversity
              Informatics  Project Summary  Mapping for biodiversity informatics requires
              information on habitat so that known species occurrences may be extrapolated
              to maps of potential species occurrences. That is, given the conversion of
              known specimen locations into maps, how can we best predict where additional
              individuals or populations of that species may occur? In the context of
              landscape ecology, landscape structure - its multi-dimensional components - is
              a primary basis for habitat preferences of bird species. Vegetation spatial
              composition, heterogeneity, variability, and scale are among the variables
              contributing to the horizontal structure, while vegetation height, layering,
              and biomass are examples of variables in the volumetric dimension. Combined
              together these variables, and others, describe the real
              multi-dimensional structure of habitat.
