BDEI: Spatial Data
              Infrastructure for Ecological Research (Planning Grant)

Summary

The
              Biodiversity and Ecosystem Informatics Research Agenda
              (http://bio.gsfc.nasa.gov) notes
the current inability to compare data across
              spatial scales as a critical problem: "Biological data
from different sources
              are frequently collected and presented in different scales and
              resolutions
resulting in a loss of detail when multiple data sets are required
              for data synthesis and analysis".

This grant brings together a team of
              ecologists and computer scientists to plan a proposal for a
"Spatial Data
              Infrastructure for Ecological Sciences." The proposed infrastructure would
              allow a
scientist to define a data set by putting together the proper
              "spatial." building blocks -- building
blocks represented in conceptually
              familiar, domain-specific terms. Data sets thus constructed
(or recast) would
              be amenable to the automatic integration of spatial locations and
              measurements
with automatic spatial data transformations.

This would allow
              spatial analysis of individual field data sets and the linking together at
              same
and different spatial scales data sets defined within the spatial
              infrastructure. We aim to include
productivity enhancing research tools such
              as field data gathering devices and data validation
and analysis, and to
              automatically tag field data with metadata early in the research cycle.
              We
thus also contribute to the synthesis of metadata and data.
