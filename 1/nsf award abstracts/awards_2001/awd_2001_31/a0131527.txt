Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for a workshop organized by the University
              of Florida focusing on research on negotiating strategies and mechanisms in
              extended enterprises which are spatially and organizationally distributed.  The
              workshop will include a mini-symposium of research papers on the topic, coupled
              with breakout sessions to identify a future research agenda.  The primary goals
              of the mini-symposium are to bring academic researchers and industry
              practitioners together to:  (1) Characterize the problems and challenges facing
              leading-edge manufacturing and service firms in the areas of electronic
              commerce (eCommerce) and supply chain management; (2) Define the state-of-the
              art technological and decision support capabilities currently available to
              industry; (3) Identify the new technological and decision support solution
              capabilities needed for both meeting newly arising challenges faced by industry
              and for driving new sources of strategic and competitive advantage; and (4)
              Identify and define academic research opportunities and challenges for
              developing new technological and decision support solution capabilities sought
              by industry.
