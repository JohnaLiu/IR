Abstract    :
              ScienCentral, with major support from NSF, has been developing and distributing
              short science stories for inclusion in local ABC news broadcasts. They are now
              developing a plan, in cooperation with NBC News Channel, to produce stories
              about cutting edge research to be carried on local NBC stations during their
              local news broadcasts.  During this planning phase, ScienCentral will produce,
              distribute and evaluate three stories about current research in the area of
              global climate change. Specific planning tasks include:  determining the
              technical and editorial processes for working with NBC News; conducting
              formative evaluations for topics, format and desired frequency of stories;
               and developing an auditable cost sharing process.   The Editorial Board for
              the project includes Eliene Augenbraun, PI/Executive Producer and former
              research scientist; Besty Rosenfield, Vice President of ScienCentral; Jack
              Penland, News Director; and Curt Epstein, Senior Producer.  They will work
              closely with an advisory panel consisting of Greg Kohler, Senior Producer, NBC
              News Channel; Leon Lederman, Office of Strategic Initiative, Illinois Institute
              of Technology; Jane Lubchenco, Environmental Scientist, Oregon State
              University; and Danielle Gray, Deputy Director for Emory University Integration
              of Education and Research, Center for Behavioral Neuroscience.  Members of the
              advisory board will review scripts and roughcuts of all segments.
