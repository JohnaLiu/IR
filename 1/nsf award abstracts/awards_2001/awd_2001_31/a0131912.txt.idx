Abstract    :
              EIA-0131912 Beard-Tisdale, Mary-Kate University of Maine  BDEI: Event and
              process tagging for information integration for the International Gulf of Maine
              Watershed  Project Summary  This incubation proposal addresses the issue of
              integrating large, diverse, and autonomous collections of scientific data
              within a complex institutional setting. The goal is to convert
              these autonomous collections into a shareable repository that supports
              synthesis of data through new metadata structures based on events and
              processes. The institutional setting is the data and data- gathering
              activities of over 80 agencies, NGOS, and academic and research institutions
              operating within the Gulf of Maine watershed. The metadata development will be
              coordinated by library and spatial information scientists working jointly with
              domain scientists. An essential task of this incubation effort will be the
              development of a shared understanding of environmental processes and events
              that becomes a shareable ontology.  Libraries play a vital role in organizing
              intellectual access to creative works. Scientific data has tended to be
              outside this traditional purview and has thus lacked the benefits of cataloging
              and indexing that promote shared access. We are proposing a new metadata
              structure that exploits common units of analysis in environmental studies:
              events and processes. Associating scientific data sets with event and process
              tags, in addition to other metadata elements, can substantially improve the
              ability to integrate and synthesize diverse scientific collections. The
              metadata initiative of this proposal will lay the foundation for specifying
              events and processes through the collaboration of data collections content
              specialists and information management specialists.
