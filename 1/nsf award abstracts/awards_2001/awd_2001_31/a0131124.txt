Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Virginia Polytechnic Institute
              and State University will upgrade a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment
              will enable researchers to carry out the following research:  a) preparation of
              organometallic complexes with unusual structure, reactivity or physical
              properties (Deck); b) studies on metal complexes of polysulfonated phosphine
              ligands as catalysts in biphasic reaction conditions (Hanson); c) isolation of
              natural products (Kingston); d) rotaxane chemistry (Gibson); e) organic
              synthesis and synthetic methodology (Carlier); and f) preparation of
              polypeptides with novel three-dimensional architecture as mimics for the
              helix-turn-helix motif in polypeptides (Etzkorn).  

Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists
              for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify
              unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
              solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
              studies will have an impact in a number of areas including organic, polymer and
              organometallic chemistry.
