Abstract    :
              The focus of this research will include the exploration of [5+2] cycloaddition
              of simple, unactivated vinylcyclopropanes, of substituent effects in the
              rearrangement and [5+1] cycloaddition of vinylcyclopropanes and of asymmetric
              [5+2] cycloadditions.  Metal-catalyzed cycloadditions in water, studies on
              [6+2] cycloadditions, and studies on [8+1], [8+2] and [8+4] cycloadditions will
              also be carried out.  Exploration of [3+2] and [4+2] cycloadditions involving
              cyclobutanones and of multicomponent cycloadditions such as [4+2+1], [5+2+1]
              and [5+2+1+1] cases will be carried out and serial cycloadditions will be
              studied as well.  The overall goal is to develop new reactions and strategies
              for the synthesis of complex molecules. 

With this renewal award, the
              Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr.
              Paul A. Wender of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University. 
              Professor Wender will focus his work on developing fundamentally new reactions,
              reagents and strategies for organic synthesis.  A special emphasis is placed on
              catalyzed reactions that, in the absence of catalyst, are forbidden or hard to
              achieve.  Further significance derives from the enormous potential of
              transition metal catalysis in the development of environmentally acceptable
              syntheses that provide little reagent-derived waste.  The project provides an
              excellent training program for pre-professionals and the results of the
              research could have a strong impact in areas outside chemistry, such as the
              pharmaceutical industry.
