Abstract    :
              The goals of this research are twofold.  First, efforts will be made to isolate
              and characterize a number of photoproducts believed to be relevant to achieving
              a chemical understanding of UVB-induced DNA damage.  Cyclobutane dimers, Dewar
              adducts and (6-4) adducts of  5-methylcytosine with thiamine and cytosine will
              be sought. Second, it will be determined if the various products isolated in
              experiments related to goal one are also formed within the context of DNA and
              in the environment of a cell nucleus.  Calf thymus DNA and nuclei and wheat DNA
              and nuclei will be used for this portion of the work.

With this award, the
              Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research efforts
              of Dr. Martin D. Shetlar of the Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry at the
              University of California, San Francisco.  Professor Shetlar will focus his work
              on finding out what happens to mammalian and plant DNA after it absorbs
              ultraviolet light.  In particular, the work focuses on the role of the minor
              base 5-methylcytosine in mediating damage induced by the absorption of
              ultraviolet light.  The research could have a broader impact in helping to
              understand the role that UV-induced lesions in DNA might play in the induction
              of skin cancer and other unwanted biological effects.
