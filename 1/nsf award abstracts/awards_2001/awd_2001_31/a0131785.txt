Abstract    :
              This project is investigating the seasonal fluxes of biogenic volatile organic
              compounds (VOCs) from grass and agricultural lands.  Biogenic VOCs are
              important because they can have a significant influence on tropospheric
              chemistry and the formation of photochemical oxidants in the atmosphere.  The
              educational component of the program includes an outreach component in
              association with five local high schools for the collection and analysis of
              leaf-level samples for use in making detailed seasonal and regional biogenic
              VOC emissions estimates for the area surrounding the Black Hills in South
              Dakota.
