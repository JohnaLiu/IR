Abstract    :
              Proposal #131855 Altunbasak, Yucel GA Tech Res. Corp - GIT  An effective way
              of providing error resilience for multimedia transmission in a communication
              system with a relatively small reduction in efficiency is multiple description
              coding (MDC), which assumes the existence of multiple independent channels
              between the transmitter and receiver, each of which can be temporarily down or
              can experience burst errors.  With MDC several coded streams, called
              descriptions, are generated and transmitted over different channels.  At the
              destination, if all of the streams are received error free, then the signal can
              be reconstructed at its highest level of fidelity.  However, if only one or a
              few descriptions are received in a usable form, the receiver can still
              reconstruct an acceptable signal.  All multiple description coding methods to
              date assume an on-off channel mode between the transmitter and the receiver;
              each link is either broken, in which case the transmitted symbols, or packets,
              are lost completely, or it functions properly, in which case the packets are
              received free of errors.  This model is appropriate for Internet transmission,
              but it is not appropriate for wireless channels.  This study replaces the
              parallel in independent on-off channel model with a wireless channel model,
              such a Rayleigh fading model.  Communication is performed using multiple
              transmit and received antennas over the channel.  With these models the signal
              at any of the receive antennas is the superposition of the transmitted signals
              from each transmit antenna independently faded.  Therefore, even if the
              descriptions at the receiver side are completely independent, the received
              signal at each antenna will include some information from each description. 
              This research involves finding the best multiple description coding strategy
              for these channels, the theoretical limits of such a scheme, and the efficiency
