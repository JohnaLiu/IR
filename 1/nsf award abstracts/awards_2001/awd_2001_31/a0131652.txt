Abstract    :
              The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is a behavior that stabilizes visual images on
              the retina during head movements. It has been demonstrated that Cartilaginous
              fishes have an eye muscle innervation pattern and VOR circuitry that is
              different from most vertebrates. The lungfish are more closely related to
              tetrapods than to other vertebrates, but they are believed to have an eye
              muscle innervation pattern similar to that of Cartilaginous fishes. It is
              therefore hypothesized that lungfish have a VOR circuitry like that of
              Cartilaginous fishes.  Testing this hypothesis requires that the organization
              of the oculomotor nuclei and VOR circuitry be determined in a representative of
              the lungfish. The African lungfish is chosen based on its commercial
              availability. Two sets of experiments are proposed. In the first set of
              experiments, retrograde transport of biotinylated dextrans amines (BDA) will be
              used to reveal the organization of the oculomotor nucleus. In the second set,
              injections of BDA into the oculomotor nucleus will be used to reveal the
              organization of the VOR connections. This research will contribute to our
              understanding of the evolution of eye movement control systems in the
              vertebrate brain. Additionally, the research project will provide experiences
              for undergraduates in basic neuroscience research.
