BDEI:
              Designing an Infrastructure for Heterogeneity in Ecosystem Data, Collaborators
              and Organizations

Project Summary

Biodiversity and ecosystems data are
              currently being gathered in a large range of formats by a
constellation of
              loosely connected private, government and not-for-profit agencies. The normal
              response
to this double heterogeneity has been the development and enforcement
              of metadata (data about data)
standards; in this response one tries to
              abstract data away from its organizational context in order to
render it
              universally accessible. This project takes the opposite track, and seeks new
              ways of grounding
environmental data in its organizational context in such a
              way that it can both be used more flexibly today
and so it can retain its
              value longer. The hypothesis, based on the last 25 years of work in the field
              of
Science Studies, is that formal data descriptions must be wrapped in
              informal descriptions in order to
be useful. The informal description for
              short-lived data is provided by face-to-face contact, by
exchanging graduate
              students, through conference papers and so forth. It is precisely this layer
              which is
lost in highly distributed data collection efforts characteristic of
              biodiversity and ecosystem informatics; it
is also this layer which is lost
              when data is wrapped in formal metadata and saved to disk. The goal of
this
              project is to open up a major new field of database inquiry tied precisely to
              the specific problems of
the biodiversity and ecosystems communities generated
              by their need for very long lasting and highly
distributed data. The project
              will develop into a larger study of the articulation between metadata
              and
narrative modes of wrapping data.
