Abstract    :
               EIA-0131889 Musavi, Muhamad University of Maine  BDEI: Planning Workshop
              on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Informatics for the Indian River Lagoon,
              Florida  Summary  This proposal solicits funding to organize and conduct a
              planning workshop that will establish and facilitate research on the
              informatics needed to address complex issues of biodiversity and ecosystem
              processes within the Indian River Lagoon. This workshop will provide
              the opportunity and resources for collaboration and discussion among
              scientists from diverse fields of biodiversity, ecological sciences, remote
              sensing, geographic information systems, computer science and intelligent
              systems. The topics to be discussed will include investigation of
              novel computational intelligence techniques for modeling, prediction, analysis
              and database management of the disparate and complex data for the Indian River
              Lagoon. The explicit products of the proposed workshop will be a white paper
              and technical report, a formal research agenda that incorporates informatics
              into existing and planned research, and preparation of a competitive proposal
              based on the recommendations and preliminary work defined by the workshop.
