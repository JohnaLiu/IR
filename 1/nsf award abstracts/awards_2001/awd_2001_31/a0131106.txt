Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to extend diffusion clock methods to determine the
              rate constant of propagation, ionization (activation) and deactivation in the
              living polymerization of isobutylene, styrene and styrene derivatives, as a
              function of solvent, temperature and catalyst.  Knowledge of these rate
              constants is fundamental for overall control in cationic polymer synthesis and
              also important in new catalyst development.

With this award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Rudolf Faust
              in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. 
              Professor Faust will focus his work on determining the absolute rate constants
              in cationic polymerization.  These studies will promote renewed research in
              catalyst design and thus lead to the production of more efficient
              polymerization catalysts.
