Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will produce
              advances in document clustering technology. The company's proprietary software
              transforms a long list of raw search results into organized hierarchical
              folders that are browsed in Windows Explorer style. This software brings into
              easy view relevant information that otherwise would remain buried in the search
              results. It also enables effortless knowledge discovery: at a glance, a user
              learns themain subtopics corresponding to the query. The company has the first
              document clusteringtechnology good enough for mass use, in terms of speed,
              quality of the clustering, and ease of interaction.
     The resultant
              software product will augment the capabilities of web, enterprise, and database
              search engines.  The market will include search engine vendors, system
              integrators and large organizations in business, academe, and government.
