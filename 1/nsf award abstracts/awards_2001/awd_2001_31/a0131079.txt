Digital Government: 
              Automated Dental Identification

This grant will support the development of
              tools for rapid identification of individuals based on dental records. The
              technology proposed has potential for high impact in investigations, such as
              the World Trade Center, where only dental records are available to aid in
              victim identification.  Technically, the work will involve the creation of a
              pilot Digital Image Repository, include image manipulation (feature extraction,
              image enhancement), high-speed databases (archiving and matching), neural nets,
              and parallel computation using a network of workstations.  The grantee will
              collaborate in this work with the FBI.
