Abstract    :
              This work combines laboratory astrophysics with basic rate process models in
              order to provide a broadly applicable research methodology for the aeronomy and
              planetary atmospheres community.  The research project will: 1) investigate the
              physical chemistry controlling the thermal properties of the atomic oxygen
              dominated upper thermosphere, 2) establish accurate models of rate processes
              for species of primary importance to aeronomy, utilizing wherever possible, a
              combination of experimental and theoretical quantities for each process, and 3)
              establish an experimental design for the measurement of atomic nitrogen
              electron impact cross sections, with an accompanying atomic model for both N
              and N+.
