              (BIOT)  Summary  Biological resources are the basis of much of this Nations
              prosperity. The wise stewardship of these riches affects current and future
              generations and, therefore, must be rooted in decisions based on the best
              information available. Because of the rapid growth of all content on the
              Internet, there is a corresponding increase in online biological information
              of all types. However, the sheer volume of data, and its widely
              varying quality and physical distribution make it impossible for decision
              makers to make critical decisions without the benefit of the existing body of
              information. This project aims to investigate and develop intelligent
              knowledge management tools and deploy them in this important domain. In
              particular, we will investigate the use of a taxonomy as a reference ontology
              to provide a conceptual framework to allow intelligent agents to
              browse biodiversity information in a variety of formats widely distributed on
              the World Wide Web.  Our goals are four fold: 1) to investigate the use of a
              taxonomy as a reference ontology for browsing biodiverity information; 2) to
              evaluate techniques to automatically classify biodiversity information (web
              sites and individual web pages; 3) to personalize the information presented to
              the users expertise and needs; and 4) lay the groundwork for larger,
              multidisciplinary, efforts in intelligent search, visualization, and
              personalization of biodiversity information.  This project proposes to build
              on existing work currently being done at the University of Kansas related to
              information discovery, retrieval, and delivery, particularly the OBIWAN
              project for ontology based search, browsing and visualization of Web resources
              and the PEET project for preserving and extending biodiversity information.
              A partnership has already been established between the University of Kansas
              and the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) to capitalize on
              the knowledge, expertise, and tools that have grown out of the existing
              University of Kansas NSF research agreement. As a result of this partnership,
              the first intelligent search agent for biodiversity information, BioBot, has
              been developed.
