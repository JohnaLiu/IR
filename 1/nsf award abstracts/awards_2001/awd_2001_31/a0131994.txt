Abstract    :
              An experimental and theoretical research program will be conducted to
              investigate fluid storage and ink delivery processes in thermal ink jet
              technology.  Specifically, the PI's will study the micro boiling process in a
              closed chamber as well as fluid flow in a foam matrix.  Several non-invasive
              visualization and diagnostic techniques will be employed.  The results could
              lead to the development of more compact and reliable ink-jet cartridges with
              lower costs in addition to opening new applications for thermal ink jet
              technology. The research will build on an existing collaboration between
              Hewlett Packard of Puerto Rico (HPPR) and the University of Puerto
              Rico-Mayaguez (UPRM), with HPPR being an active participant in the research
              effort.
