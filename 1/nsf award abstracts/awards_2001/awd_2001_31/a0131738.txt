Abstract    :
              
	This research would investigate Mexican American ethnicity in two mid-size
              communities (Santa Maria, California and Garden City, Kansas).  These locations
              extend sociological research on ethnicity beyond the usual major metropolitan
              areas.  120 interviews in the two communities will address questions of the
              strength of ethnic identification and the relationships between established
              residents and new immigrants.  An organizational comparison of Mexican American
              civil rights groups in the two communities will also help us understand how
              ethnicity develops and is expressed.  A principal research question focuses on
              how the different patterns of immigration in the two communities (continuous
              immigration in Santa Maria versus distinct phases in Garden City) have affected
              ethnic identification and solidarity.
