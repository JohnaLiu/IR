Abstract    :
                Within the brain there are cells called glial cells that are intimately
              involved with the functions of neurons (nerve cells), and astrocytes form a
              whole class of glial cells.  In mammals, astrocytes and neurons in an area
              called the arcuate nucleus show sexual dimorphism; during development, the
              cells in males become structurally different from the cells in females.  This
              differentiation is hormonally mediated by the steroid hormone estradiol, even
              though the astrocytes lack molecular receptors for estrogens, and there is
              evidence that the neurotransmitter compound GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid) is
              involved.  This project uses biochemical and molecular approaches to test the
              hypothesis that estradiol modulates the release of GABA, which in turn
              modulates calcium influx, promoting the formation of gap junctions throughout
              the population, so the whole population can differentiate together despite the
              lack of estrogen receptors.
   Results from this work will have an impact
              beyond neuroendocrinology, including developmental neuroscience and cell
              biology, and the relatively new area of glial neurobiology.  In addition, the
              project continues the PI's excellent record of training graduate students and
              community outreach.
