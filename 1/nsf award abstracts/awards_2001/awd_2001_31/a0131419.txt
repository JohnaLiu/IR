Abstract    :
              Catecholamines, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, are regulatory molecules
              produced by neurons and the adrenal gland.  Recently, investigators discovered
              that selected cells of the immune system not only take up catecholamines, but
              also synthesize these molecules.  There is no information, however, on the
              regulation of catecholamine synthesis and release in these cells.  Furthermore,
              the functions of catecholamines released by immune cells are not clear.  The
              goal of this project is to investigate the molecular regulation of
              catecholamine synthesis, storage, and release in the RAW264.7 macrophage cell
              line and in peritoneal macrophages isolated from mice.  The autocrine and
              paracrine actions of macrophage-derived catecholamines also will be
              investigated. 

Macrophages are important cells in the immune system, and
              catecholamines are important molecules produced by neural and endocrine cells.
              Based on new evidence that immune cells produce catecholamines, this project
              will explore the synthesis and function of these molecules in macrophages. 
              Results of this study will contribute to our understanding of macrophage
              functions and provide clues to links between the nervous, endocrine and immune
              systems.
