Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
              State University will acquire a X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector for
              small molecule diffractometry. This equipment will enhance research in a number
              of areas including the following: a) analysis of endohedral fullerenes (Dorn);
              b) structure-function relationships of natural products exhibiting anticancer
              activity (Kingston); c) studies on rotaxanes and pseudorotaxanes (Gibson); d)
              studies on the structure, physical properties and reactivity of
              perfluoroarylated transition metal cyclopentadienyl complexes (Deck); e)
              investigations of catalysis using metal complexes of polysulfonated
              triarylphosphines in aqueous and biphasic solvents (Hanson); and f) studies on
              charge-transfer molecular magnets (Yee).

The X-ray diffractometer allows
              accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a
              molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate
              information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the
              neighboring molecules.  These studies will have an impact in a number of areas,
              including the preparation of more efficient catalysts; materials chemistry;
              pharmaceutical chemistry; and biochemistry.
