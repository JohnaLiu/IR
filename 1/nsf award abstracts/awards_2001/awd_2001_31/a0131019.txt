Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Rockhurst University will
              upgrade a permanent magnet CW NMR instrument to a FT-NMR. This equipment will
              enable researchers to carry out studies in natural products synthesis and
              medicinal chemistry.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the
              most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure
              of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize
              specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR
              spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
              A broad spectrum of students at this undergraduate institution will benefit
              from the upgrade since the investigators plan to integrate the spectrometer
              into coursework.
