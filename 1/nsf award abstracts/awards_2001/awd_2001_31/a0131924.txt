              The Eco Flight Simulator: Visualizing landscape patterns, ecosystem processes
              and  biodiveresity information using flight simulator
              technology

Summary

This proposal develops the Eco Flight Simulator  a
              system for visualizing landscape patterns,
ecosystem processes and
              biodiversity data. Many state and federal agencies are currently
gathering
              large amounts of spatial data via aerial photographs and satellite imagery that
              can be
used for seeing the landscape (distribution and location of habitats,
              size of habitat fragments, the
relationships among political and ecosystem
              boundaries), the analysis of ecosystem processes
(water cycling, nutrient
              cycling, pollution movement) and biodiversity issues (habitat
              types,
population of invasive species, species interactions, etc.). For the
              most part these data are
currently presented in the form of maps using GIS
              software. The view is static and the data
displayed are static (but see the
              USGS's National Map Initiative). However, flight simulator
technologies,
              developed first for the military and now common in the entertainment
              industry,
offer a much better visualization technology - a user defined birds
              eye view of the landscape
that can include the spatio-temporal complexity of
              the environment. Using standard off the shelf
hardware, open source software
              and public domain data, marine (Stellwagen Bank National
Marine Sanctuary in
              the Gulf of Maine) and terrestrial flight simulations (Ipswich and
              Parker
River Watersheds of Essex County Massachusetts) (one simulator) are
              developed that present
environmental information in new ways.
