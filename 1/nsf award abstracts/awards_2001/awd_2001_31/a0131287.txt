The long-term goal of the Hanna-Rose laboratory is to
              elucidate the molecular mechanisms that direct organogenesis. The focus of the
              proposed research is a detailed investigation of the role of the cog-2 gene and
              of a specific cell-cell fusion in promoting proper attachment of the C. elegans
              uterus and vulva. cog?2 encodes a Sox (SRY-related HMG box) family
              transcription factor that is expressed in a specific cell of the uterus called
              the uterine seam cell (utse).  The utse normally executes a developmentally
              programmed cell fusion to another gonadal cell called the anchor cell.  This
              cell-cell fusion promotes formation of an open channel between the uterus and
              the vulva in a late stage of organogenesis.  In the absence of cog-2 function,
              utse cell fate is induced but fusion to the anchor cell (AC) is not executed. 
              The aims of the proposed research are to determine whether COG-2 acts to
              regulate fusion directly or affects fusion indirectly through an effect on utse
              cell fate, to identify and characterize additional genes involved in AC-utse
              fusion, and to identify COG-2 binding partners.  Results are expected to
              elucidate mechanisms whereby COG-2 functions.  This will also shed light on
              potential regulatory targets for vertebrate Sox proteins.  Furthermore, the
              results are expected to increase our understanding of how the formation of a
              proper connection between two organs is genetically programmed and to promote
              the development of tools for probing the mechanism of cell fusion.
