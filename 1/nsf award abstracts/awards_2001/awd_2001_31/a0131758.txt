The focus of the proposed study is to characterize the gene
              regulation networks underlying notochord differentiation in a simple chordate,
              the ascidian Ciona intestinalis.  The research plan includes three specific
              aims.  First, the Snail repressor appears to inhibit notochord differentiation
              in the presumptive tail muscles.  This will be tested by misexpressing both
              wild-type and mutant forms of the Snail protein in electroporated embryos using
              defined tissue-specific enhancers.  Second, two different target genes of the
              Brachyury activator, Ezrin and Meg1, have been implicated in mediating cell
              shape changes during notochord differentiation.  The activities of the encoded
              proteins will be investigated by expressing different dominant-negative forms
              of the proteins in the notochord.  The third line of research will explore the
              basis of T box specificity, whereby related T-containing transcription factors
              control the differentiation of distinct tissues.  Particular efforts will focus
              on Brachyury and Tbx6, which regulate distinct sets of target genes in the
              notochord and tail muscles, respectively.
