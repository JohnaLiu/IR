Abstract    :
              EIA-0131899 Dickerson, Allan Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
              University   SUMMARY  Cells routinely perform complex computational tasks
              that enable them to control the orchestration of thousands of genes and
              communicate with other cells to manifest emergent properties such as
              growth and differentiation.Understanding and engineering the algorithms
              underlying the complex computational machinery of cells should have
              significant impact in science and technology,particularly
              biotechnology, biocomputation and medicine.  Several notable recent reports
              demonstrate that it is possible to design and construct simple de novo genetic
              circuits such as a switch and an oscillator in Escherichia coli .This work also
              revealed that implementation of even the most simple circuits in vivo requires
              tedious optimization of often poorly- understood protein-DNA interactions and
              mRNA and protein stabilities,among other parameters.We propose to develop
              efficient,evolutionary design strategies for constructing functional de novo
              genetic circuits.We will apply methods of molecular evolution,which have
              proven highly successful for engineering proteins with improved or altered
              properties,to complex genetic systems involving
              multiple repressors,operators,and promoters.We believe that evolution will
              prove to be generally applicable for optimizing individual devices as well as
              complex genetic circuits,and our goal will be to demonstrate how evolutionary
              searches are best performed in order to build libraries of devices and assemble
              them into functional circuits.
