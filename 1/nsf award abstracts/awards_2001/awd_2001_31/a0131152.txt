Funds from this award provide partial support for purchase of
              a multi-node computer cluster. With this new facility, geophysicists at
              Princeton University will study how earthquakes influence local crustal stress
              fields and change the probability of new seismic events.  Further algorithm
              development should also make significant improvements in our ability to image
              the interior structure of the  Earth.  Such improvements will incorporate the
              effects of finite frequency wavefront healing.  Mathematical theories
              incorporating the effects of wave diffraction for more realistic seismic
              tomograms were developed at Princeton but this group has so far lacked the
              computational facilities to exploit it fully at resolutions of geological
              interest (< 100 km).
