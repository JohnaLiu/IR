Abstract    :
              The hormone ethylene regulates a number of processes in higher plants including
              fruit ripening, tissue aging, shedding of fruits and leaves, wound responses,
              and growth. This research is a continuation of previous efforts by this lab to
              investigate the mechanisms by which the Arabidopsis ETR family of ethylene
              receptors sense ethylene and trigger responses in the plant cells. Toward this
              end several important new tools have been or are being developed, including: 1)
              mutant plants that are deficient in each of the 5 receptor proteins; 2) a
              system for producing receptor proteins in yeast cells for biochemical analysis;
              and 3) a high resolution method for assessing rapid changes in seedling growth
              in response to ethylene. Using these basic systems, the mechanisms by which
              ethylene is perceived by the ETR receptors and how this binding is transmitted
              through the receptor protein to downstream effector proteins is being
              investigated. Effort is also being devoted to sorting out the specific roles
              that the different isoforms of the receptor play in the transduction of the
              ethylene signal. 

This research will lead to a better understanding of the
              mechanisms by which ethylene works and allow us to develop new, less toxic ways
              to prevent crop spoilage and control ripening processes.
