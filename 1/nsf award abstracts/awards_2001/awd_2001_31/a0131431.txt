Knotted1 is the founding member of the knox (knotted1-like
              homeobox) gene family that has been identified in all plants surveyed so far.
              Homeobox genes encode transcription factors that regulate the activities of
              other genes. Class I knox genes are expressed in the meristem and stem. The
              initial down-regulation of knox genes in the meristem marks the site of leaf
              initiation. Ectopic expression of knox genes in leaves due to spontaneous
              mutations or overexpression results in dramatic alterations in leaf morphology,
              occasional ectopic meristems and changes in hormone levels. Loss-of-function
              knox mutants have begun to reveal specific roles for different members. The
              maize knotted1 (kn1) and Arabidopsis STM genes are required for meristem
              initiation and/or maintenance, whereas rice osh15 and Arabidopsis KNAT1, also
              known as brevipedicellus (bp), are required in stem tissues.  There are two
              other class I knox genes in Arabidopsis, KNAT2 and KNAT6. Insertion alleles
              will be obtained for these two genes. A mosaic analysis of bp will be carried
              out to determine the role of KNAT1 in different tissues. Genetic analysis will
              help sort out the roles for different knox genes in Arabidopsis. A number of
              approaches will be taken to identify targets of the KNOX family that include
              expression profiling, sequence comparisons and biochemistry. Identification of
              a large number of potential targets will provide the opportunity to determine
              which target genes are in common or distinct to different KNOX proteins. A
              select number of the target genes will be analyzed to determine their function.
              The long range goal is to understand the role of KNOX proteins in meristem
              maintenance and plant architecture.
