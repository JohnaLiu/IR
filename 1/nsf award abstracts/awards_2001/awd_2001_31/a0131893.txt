              National Large-Scale City True Orthophoto Mapping and Its Standard

This
              grant will support planning for a larger proposal to investigate the
              development of new 3D algorighms for use of digital orthophoto maps in urban
              areas.  Current usage of such maps at high resolution in urban areas has
              identified problems with perspective displacements, occlusions by tall
              buildings, geometric inaccuracies, and an inability to create a seamless mosaic
              of large images.  The grant will also allow more complete planning of a
              partnership with the US Geological Survey, which runs the NationalDigital
              Orthophoto Program.
