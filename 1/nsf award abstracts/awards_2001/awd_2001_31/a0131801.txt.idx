Abstract    :
              EIA-0131801 Doruska, Paul  University of Arkansas  BDEI: Quantifying Forest
              Ground Flora Biomass and Diversity Using Close-Range Remote
              Sensing.  Summary   Researchers propose the use of close-range remote
              sensing to estimate biomass per unit area and species diversity of forest
              ground flora. Ground flora biomass and diversity information is useful when
              describing forested ecosystems, gauging results in scientific experiments and
              determining the need for herbicide application to reduce unwanted competition
              in forest crops. Scientists will use both color and color infrared
              digital imagery to study forest ground flora biomass and species diversity of
              pine stands in southeastern Arkansas and mixed pine-hardwood stands in the
              Ouachita Mountains in central Arkansas.  Airborne and/or space-borne imagery
              have been used to estimate forest overstory biomass. However, such platforms
              cannot be used to estimate biomass of forest ground flora species because (a.)
              spatial resolution is too coarse for the required level of detail, and (b.)
              the presence of the overstory canopy can hinder use of such imagery.
              The objectives of this project are to (1) determine if these metrics can be
              collected through close-range remote sensing, and (2) identify spectral
              signatures for a number of species of forest ground flora.
