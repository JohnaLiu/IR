Abstract    :
              This award from the Partnerships for Advanced Computational Infrastructure
              Program provides support for 25 American scientists to participate in a US-UK
              Workshop on Grid Computing.  The purpose of the workshop is to: 1) identify
              Grid research, development, and deployment activities that could be carried out
              jointly by researchers from the United States and the United Kingdom; 2)
              explore common interests in both applications and infrastructure (middleware,
              networking) that would warrant, and benefit from, the creation of a high-speed
              transatlantic testbed, and 3) if  such a testbed is desirable, begin to develop
              the technical agenda for a high-speed transatlantic testbed.  The workshop will
              be held on August 4-5, 2001 in San Francisco just prior to the tenth
              High-Performance Distributed Computing (HPDC-10) Conference.  This workshop
              award will pay travel expenses for US participants.  The US co-organizers are
              Carl Kesselman (USC-ISI) and Paul Messina (Caltech).
