Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at Emory University will acquire a
              Circular Dichroism Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a
              number of areas including a) the design of polypeptide materials of precise and
              controllable molecular structure (Conticello); b) studies on flavoenzyme
              systems (Edmondson); c) peptide structure and self-assembly (Lynn); d)
              transition metal-DNA interactions (Marzilli); and e) bio-organic chemistry of
              protein-DNA complexes (Mohler).  

Circular dichroism spectroscopy is an
              extremely useful tool in modern analytical chemistry.  It provides a very
              reliable and sensitive method for assigning absolute molecular configurations. 
              The results from these studies will have an impact in a number of areas, in
              particular, biochemistry.
