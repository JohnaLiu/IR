Residential Mobility and Adolescent Risk Behavior

This research
              seeks to explain why a family's residential mobility tends to have a negative
              impact on their adolescent children.  Changing schools is correlated with a
              variety of risky adolescent behaviors and negative outcomes such as
              delinquency, sexual activity, suicide, and poor academic achievement.  This
              study attempts to identify the mechanisms that explain these outcomes. Peer
              social networks may be especially important since low status, often deviant,
              peer groups may be more receptive to new, entering students.  The analysis will
              use new longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
              Health (Add Health) that include measures of  both outcomes and peer networks. 
              The project holds promise for developing  theories of social control and social
              networks, and for informing parents and school officials as they deal with the
              stresses experienced by adolescents when they move to new communities and
              schools.
