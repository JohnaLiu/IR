Abstract    :
              Plants synthesize two major groups of carotenoids: carotenes, which
              are
cyclized or uncyclized hydrocarbons (e.g. lycopene and beta carotene),
              and
xanthophylls, which are variously oxygenated derivatives of carotenes
              (e.g.
lutein and zeaxanthin). Carotene hydroxylases (OHases) add hydroxyl
              groups
to the rings of cyclic carotenes and are essential for the synthesis of
              all
xanthophylls in plants.  This proposal performs a detailed analysis
              of
carotene hydroxylases in plant tissues by isolating genes defining
              specific
carotene hydroxylases and modifying the expression of one or more
              activity
by mutant analysis.  The consequences of such modifications on
              carotenoid
and xanthophyll synthesis and composition in photosynthetic tissues
              will
provide important insights into the role of each enzyme in the pathway
              and
the consequences of pathway engineering in food crops. Given the
              importance
of carotenes as antioxidants in the human diet and the role(s)
              of
carotenoids in decreasing the incidence and progression of
              macular
degeneration, various cancers and vitamin A deficiency in certain
              subgroups
of the global population, a further understanding of the enzymes
              involved
in carotenoid and xanthophyll synthesis may have beneficial impacts
              on the
overall health of the population.
