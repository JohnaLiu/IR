Digital Government:  Collaborative Research:  Integration of
              Data and Interfaces to Enhance Human Understanding of Government Statistics -
              Toward the National Statistical Knowledge Network

This award will support
              collaborative research with several Federal statistical agencies to develop
              better statistical data models, to explore the use of SML, to develop better
              map-querying tools and to integrate other available tools for manipulating,
              browsing and visualizing tabular data.  The goal is to develop better
              human/computer interfaces for expert users to novices, to increase general
              statistical literacy, and to provide seamless access to data held by multiple
              Federal agencies and agencies at other levels of government, in particular
              state and local data.
