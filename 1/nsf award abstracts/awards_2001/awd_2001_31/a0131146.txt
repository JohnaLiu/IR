Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the State University of New York
              in Stony Brook will acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will
              enable researchers to carry out studies on a) the development of synthetic
              processes based on organometallic catalysts and the development of synthetic
              methods for natural products and their congeners (Ojima); b) synthesis of
              biologically active natural products and designed molecular probes (Parker); c)
              synthesis of analogues of Coenzyme A and development of computer-designed
              receptors and sensors for biological molecules (Drueckhammer); d)
              investigations on the role of disintegrins in mammalian fertilization and on
              understanding enzyme motion (Sampson); e) the structure and reactivity of
              all-carbon molecules (Goroff); and f) the preparation of designed
              supramolecular structures (Fowler).  

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. 
              Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including biochemistry, biological sensor
              development, and materials chemistry.
