Abstract    :
              This proposal will fund a workshop which brings together leading US librarians
              and computer specialists to address the needs for quality information in
              digital libraries.  It will address selection of materials for scanning and
              content needs for large-scale digital libraries, in conjunction with the major
              scanning project being directed by CMU.  It will survey national needs and
              opportunities in the digital content area.

The workshop will take place in
              Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on November 15 and 16, 2001.
