During embryonic development the pharyngeal endoderm forms a
              series of pharyngeal pouches in many, if not all chordates. The pharyngeal
              pouches develop into a diverse array of specialized structures in different
              organisms. For example, the pharyngeal pouches form gills in many invertebrate
              and vertebrate species, while in terrestrial animals, the pouches form
              pharyngeal organs, such as the thymus, but do not form gills.  Recent work from
              the P.I.'s laboratory suggests that in mice, Hoxa3 expression in the 3rd
              pharyngeal pouch endoderm is required for both initiation of thymus
              organogenesis and suppression of gill formation.  Hoxa3 is also required to up
              regulate the Pax1/9 genes in the 3rd pouch endoderm. The proposed experiments
              will test the hypothesis that the expression of Hoxa3 in the pharyngeal pouch
              endoderm in higher vertebrates modifies Pax1/9 gene expression, resulting in
              the development of different pharyngeal pouch-derived structures in different
              vertebrate species. The proposed studies will use 3 different vertebrate
              species, the lamprey, zebrafish, and mouse, representing a range of vertebrate
              body plans. Specific aim 1 will determine whether Hox3 and Pax1/9 gene
              expression patterns in the pharyngeal region in these three species can be
              correlated with differences in pharyngeal morphogenesis and organogenesis. The
              second aim will test whether zfHoxa3a is required for thymus formation in the
              zebrafish, as it is in mouse. In aim 3, misexpression of the lamprey,
              zebrafish, and mouse Hox3 genes will test whether Hox3 proteins from all of
              these species can induce an ectopic thymus and/or block gill formation. The
              fourth aim will use gene targeting to "knock-in" the lamprey Hox3 and zebrafish
              zfHoxa3a gene sequences to the mouse Hoxa3 locus, thereby determining to what
              extent these genes can substitute functionally for mouse Hoxa3. The experiments
              in Aims 3 and 4 will test whether there has been an acquisition of new
              functions by the Hoxa3 protein during vertebrate evolution. The results from
              the proposed studies will provide evidence for possible mechanisms by which
              vertebrates have evolved "newer" functions, such as adaptive immunity, from
              evolutionarily ancient embryonic structures. In addition, these studies may
              provide molecular insights into the loss of gills in air-breathing
              vertebrates.
