Abstract    :
              In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division,  Bililign will address two important issues of physical
              chemistry. The first deals with the reaction dynamics of M-H2 (M = alkali
              metal). By measuring the nascent rotational state distribution of the LiH
              product we will try to understand the reaction mechanism. The second deals with
              the C-H activation by metal atoms. The physical and chemical quenching of
              excited Li atoms by alkane and alkene hydrocarbons will be investigated by
              means of  cascade and time-resolved atomic fluorescence techniques. Far-wing
              scattering state spectroscopy will be employed in the studies of  reaction
              dynamics.

This research deals with two important areas of chemical reaction
              processes. The goal is to understand how reagent molecules approach, collide,
              exchange energy, and finally separate into products. The benefits of such
              knowledge include applications to the modeling of chemical reactions in the
              upper atmospheric, plasma processes, chemical synthesis, and chemical reaction
              process technology.  This work will be conducted with students who will thereby
              gain research experience in preparation for advanced studies or entry into the
              scientific/technological workforce.
