              Software: Open Compilation for Self-Optimizing Generic Components

This
              proposal is to advance the state-of-the-art in high-performance software
              specifically related tot he design and compilation of high-performance
              scientific libraries.  This work will address two of the most important
              issues-code complexity and performance optimization-by applying and extending
              two emerging programming paradigm: generic programming and concept-based
              optimization.  The vehicle for this work will be development of an integrated
              framework consisting of open compilation and generic library technologies.  By
              simultaneously developing the compilation technologies and the library
              technologies-and by providing mechanism to couple the two together-the whole
              will be greater than the sum of its parts
