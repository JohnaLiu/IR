Semantic-based program analysis provides useful
              information to
compilers, debuggers and other program manipulation tools. 
              Existing
frameworks for logic program analysis do not provide support
              for
backward or parametric analyses that are emerging as useful tools
              in
logic program development. Nor do they provide sufficient support
              for
context-sensitive analyses.  The project seeks to create a new
framework
              that will support these new classes of analyses as well as
those supported by
              existing frameworks.  The research focuses on (i)
developing systematic
              methods for designing parametric, backward and
context-sensitive analyses and
              methods for efficient computation of
these analyses; (ii) integrating research
              findings in logic program
analysis; (iii) implementing a software environment
              that facilitates
design, implementation and evaluation of program analyses;
              and (iv)
identifying, implementing and evaluating new program analyses. 
              A
better understanding of parametric analysis, backward analysis
              and
context-sensitive analysis may be obtained out of the research and
that
              would provide a breakthrough in the field of logic program
analysis. This
              project plans to incorporate research results into the
classroom by developing
              and enhancing several courses in computer
science and software engineering. It
              also offers educational
opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students
              to work on
leading edge research projects.
