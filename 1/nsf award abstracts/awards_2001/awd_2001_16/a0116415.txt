NSF Program : 1189      MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION

Abstract    :
              This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) project seeks financial support to
              acquire a modular, instrumented single-screw extruder with sensors and a
              multi-function co-injection molding machine as experimental instruments to be
              used at the Polymer Engineering Center (PEC), University of Wisconsin-Madison.
              The research proposed here responds to the call by the NSF's Directorate for
              Engineering, as stated in its "NSF Engineering: The Long View" document, for
              rapid development of "advanced manufacturing technologies" based on "advanced
              fabrication and processing methods" and "advancements in the quality of
              education on maintaining a preeminent engineering work force."

The
              acquisition and development of these state-of-the-art, instrumented machines
              will improve the quality and expand the scope of current research, research
              training, and integrated research and education activities related to polymer
              processing at the PEC. Specifically, these instrumented machines will expedite
              the research progress in improving existing and developing new polymer
              processing methods; it will also enhance the learning environment that serves
              nearly 250 student attendances in various polymer processing courses and lab
              sessions each semester at UW-Madison.
