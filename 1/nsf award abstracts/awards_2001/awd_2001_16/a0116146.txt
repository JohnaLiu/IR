Abstract    :
              In addition to the strong interaction between neutrons 
and protons which binds
              them in the nucleus, there 
is also a "weak" interaction. The precise strength
              of
this interaction between neutrons and protons is not known, and
current
              results from different experiment are contradictory.
However, the weak
              interaction is known to possess the unique
property of causing reactions that
              look different in a mirror.
We intend to construct a detector which can
              sense
part-per-billion mirror asymmetries in reactions involving 
neutrons
              and protons that produce gamma rays. This detector
will first be used in an
              upcoming experiment at the LANSCE pulsed neutron
source at Los Alamos which
              will detect the mirror asymmetry in neutron capture
on protons. It will be
              designed and constructed at the Indiana 
University Cyclotron Facility.
