This award to Coastal Carolina University in South Carolina
              will provide support for acquisition of instrumentation for research on
              microbial ecology.  It supports strong, ongoing efforts in integration of
              research and education at CCU, which has a large marine studies program and
              active programs involving undergraduates in research in environmental sciences.
               Specific instrumentation supported here includes a compound microscope with
              image analyzer, a data logging multiprobe, a multi-channel respirometer and
              incubators.  The university will provide additional instrumentation under this
              project, including electrophoresis apparatus, gel documentation system,
              additional incubators, fluorometers, peristaltic pumps and computers for data
              logging and analysis.  CCU is a non-Ph.D.-granting university; the university
              will contribute about 22% of the total cost of this project from non-federal
              funds.
