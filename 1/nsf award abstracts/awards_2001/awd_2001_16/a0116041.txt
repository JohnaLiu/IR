Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Akron will acquire a X-ray
              diffractometer with CCD detector for single crystal diffractometry. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
              a) cyclyne and heterocyclyne chemistry; b) metal-silyl complexes; c) synthesis
              and characterization of electron deficient, organometallic compounds; d)
              coordination polymers as zeolite analogs; and e) the preparation, understanding
              and utilization of dendritic macromolecules.

The X-ray diffractometer allows
              accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a
              molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate
              information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the
              neighboring molecules.  These studies will have an impact in a number of areas,
              including the preparation of more efficient catalysts and materials chemistry.
