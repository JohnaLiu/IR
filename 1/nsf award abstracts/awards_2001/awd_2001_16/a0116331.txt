Abstract

The PI and six colleagues in the
              Departments of Chemical engineering, Materials Science and Engineering,
              Biomedical Engineering, and Electrical and Computer Engineering at the
              University of Michigan are requesting funds to purchase a confocal laser
              scanning microscope.  This will enhance their research and research training in
              nanoscale engineering of complex fluids and biomaterials.  Specifics proposed
              applications of the instrument are: to quantify defect dynamics during
              annealing of colloidal crystals, to detect self-assembled proteins, to observe
              microfluidic flows on cellular development, and to facilitate the efficient
              design of microfabricated devices.
