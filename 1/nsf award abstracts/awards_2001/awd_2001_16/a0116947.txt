A. Hirsa, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute

This
              proposal is one part of a collaborative research effort between Dr. Hirsa of
              Rensselaer and Dr. Lopez of Arizona State University (CTS-0116995) on the
              effects of bulk flow on monolayer formation at gas/liquid interfaces.  These
              two are renewal proposals for the present Grants CTS-9803478 at Rensselaer and
              CTS-9896259 at ASU.
The present grants focus on the experimental and
              theoretical/computational study of interfacial transport properties of
              monolayers of insoluble surfactants on the air/water interface.  It is proposed
              to extend the study to the effect of bulk liquid flow on the self-assembled
              monolayers along the air/liquid interface.  Dr. Hirsa will carry out
              experimental investigations and Dr. Lopez will perform
              theoretical/computational studies.
