The plant hormone auxin controls multiple developmental
              processes including elongation of stems, branching of shoots and roots, bending
              toward or away from light or gravity, and patterning of various tissues.  Auxin
              Response Factors (ARFs) are a family transcription factors that regulate
              induction and repression of genes in response to auxin, and therefore have key
              functions in mediating these developmental processes.  This project will focus
              on functions and interactions of ARF6 and ARF8, two ARFs in the model plant
              Arabidopsis thaliana that activate genes in response to auxin.  The aims of the
              project are i) to discover developmental functions of these two transcription
              factors by characterizing phenotypes of arf6 and arf8 mutant plants and of
              transgenic plants that overexpress epitope-tagged ARF6 or ARF8; ii) to identify
              genes that ARF6 and ARF8 regulate by hybridizing probes made from untreated or
              auxin-treated wild-type and mutant plants to gene chips containing DNA
              representing thousands of Arabidopsis genes; iii) to explore functional
              interactions between ARF6 and ARF8 and selected proteins of the related Aux/IAA
              family, by constructing double mutants between arf6 and arf8 and selected
              mutations in IAA genes and examining their phenotypes; iv) to raise ARF6- and
              ARF8-specific anti-peptide antibodies; and v) to use these antibodies and the
              epitope-tagged proteins to study whether ARF6 and ARF8 interact with other
              proteins in vivo.  These studies will provide a multifaceted view of the
              functions of ARF6 and ARF8, setting the stage for similar analyses of other
