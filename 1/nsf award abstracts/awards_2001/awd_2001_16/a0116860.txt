Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59)

Through a national engineering education conference,
              this project is supporting the formation of a cooperative coalition between
              community and four-year colleges, that will result in improved educational
              opportunities for engineering students. The conference is being held at Itasca
              Community College, Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Teams of high school, two-year and
              four-year faculty will work towards developing articulation agreements that
              will ensure seamless and successful educational experiences for engineering
              students. The outcome of this forum will be the creation of a National
              Collaboration for Engineering Education, a partnership that will be
              instrumental in reversing the current trend of declining engineering enrollment
              in the face of increasing need for engineers. The partnership will also be
              instrumental in raising the numbers of students from underrepresented groups
              who pursue engineering careers.
