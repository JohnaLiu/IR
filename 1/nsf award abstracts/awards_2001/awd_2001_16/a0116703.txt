Abstract    :
              This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to support participation in the
              DYCOMS-II project scheduled for July 2001.  DYCOMS (Dynamics and Chemistry of
              Marine Stratocumulus) is a study of mixing processes in stratocumulus clouds in
              the marine boundary layer off the coast of California.  The main objective is
              to obtain high-resolution aircraft data (using the NCAR C-130) on temperature,
              humidity, vertical air velocity, and cloud properties, that can be used for
              validating large-eddy simulations of the boundary layer.  The ultimate goal is
              to improve the parameterization of cloud-top mixing processes in large-scale
              models of atmospheric circulation and climate.  Dr. Lilly will participate in
              the planning and field work of DYCOMS and use the experiments as an opportunity
              to evaluate a theoretical model for entrainment mixing that he has recently
              developed.  This study will complement the main DYCOMS plan, which is to
              reconcile the observations of turbulent mixing with large-eddy simulations.
