NGS:  Workshop
              on Manufacturing Software Integration Research:  Status and Future
              Directions

This workshop is to support travel and registration expenses for
              invited speakers, and students to attend The Workshop on Manufacturing Software
              Integration Research.  It  will be held at NIST and will bring together
              researchers to discuss systems software issues on supporting the integration of
              heterogeneous software components, a very important issue in enabling modern
              manufacturing planning and control support systems.
