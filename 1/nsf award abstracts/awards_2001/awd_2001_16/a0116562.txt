Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin in Oshkosh will acquire
              an isothermal titration microcalorimeter for the study of solution-phase
              reactions, and a differential thermal analyzer for the thermal characterization
              of solids. The isothermal titration microcalorimeter will be used to enhance
              studies of the binding properties of heavy metal ions to polysaccharides such
              as capsules that are produced by certain cyanobacteria.  The differential
              thermal analyzer will be used primarily for thermal characterization of
              nanoscale materials.  Students at this primarily undergraduate campus will be
              heavily involved in these research projects.  

Calorimetry is an extremely
              useful tool in modern analytical chemistry.  Calorimetric analysis is used to
              measure the thermal energy (heat) exchange that occurs during molecular
              interactions and reactions.  The isothermal titration microcalorimetry studies
              have practial implications regarding the fate of heavy metal ions and possible
              bioremediation strategies on the Lake Winnebago/Fox River ecosystem.
