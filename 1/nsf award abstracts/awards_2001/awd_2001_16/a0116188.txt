A research grade 16-inch telescope and
              instrumentation for the Fountainhead Observatory of Southwestern University
              will be specified, purchased, integrated and verified. Southwestern University
              is a small non-PhD granting institution that focuses on teaching and
              undergraduate research in the astronomical sciences. This telescope and
              instrument system will be used in three instrument areas: 1. Photometry of RR
              Lyrae stars to yield masses and luminosities of these stars, 2. Photometry of
              active galactic nuclei, 3. Photometry of Type IIn supernovae.
