Abstract    :
              This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) project provides for the purchase a
              double-focusing magnetic sector mass spectrometer to be utilized in support of
              research in the Department of Earth System Science and the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine.  The instrument will be
              utilized in research addressing the atmospheric chemistry and biogeochemistry
              of organohalogens contributing to ozone depletion, the accumulation and origin
              of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the use of hydrocarbons as tracers of
              major tropospheric sources such as biomass burning, industrial emissions, and
              biogenic emissions, and the role of hydrocarbons in tropospheric chemistry.
