Abstract    :
              This award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will enable the
              Chemistry Department at Rutgers University in Newark to acquire a suite of
              instruments for research in materials chemistry:  a gel permeation
              chromatograph (GPC), simultaneous static and dynamic light scattering (SSDLS)
              instrumentation and a voltammetric analyzer.  The GPC and light-scattering
              instrument will be used to determine molecular weights of polymers, and the
              voltammetric analyzer will be used to study the electrochemical properties of
              novel metal-containing polymers and to make critical electrochemical
              measurements for organic materials.  

Dynamic light scattering experiments
              allow one to determine the sizes and shapes of inorganic nanoparticles, and of
              self-assembled polymer superstructures, whereas the voltammetric analyzer is a
              critical tool when designing nanomolecular devices.  These instruments are
              essential for materials characterization.
