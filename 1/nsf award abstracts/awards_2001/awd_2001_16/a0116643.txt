This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of
              California San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography will provide support
              for acquisition of a cluster computer system for use by the new Center for
              Observations, Modeling, and Prediction at Scripps (COMPAS).  Research use of
              the system will emphasize regional to global scale ocean/atmosphere modeling,
              fine-scale modeling of coastal and wave processes, process-oriented ocean
              modeling and ocean state estimation, and graduate education, to which 25% of
              the computational time will be allocated.  The system will be housed at Scripps
              Institution of Oceanography; technical support and archival storage will be
              provided by the San Diego Supercomputer Center.  UCSD will contribute 30% of
              the cost of this project from non-federal funds.
