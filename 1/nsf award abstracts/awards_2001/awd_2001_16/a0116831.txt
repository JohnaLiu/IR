Abstract    :
              This award will support research to reconstruct the drought history of the
              eastern United States over the last 500-1,000 years using the analysis of
              tree-rings from two species of long-lived conifers; the eastern red cedar
              (Juniperus virginiana) and the northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis). This
              data will greatly improve estimates of the full range of drought variability
              across the United States. 

The widespread discovery of ancient forests of
              these tree species living or preserved on steep cliff faces in the northeast
              will enable the development of tree-ring chronologies covering the past 1,000
              years from living trees and well-preserved fossil wood. Eastern red and
              northern white cedar may represent the only widely distributed species that are
              available for developing a network of such long drought-sensitive tree-ring
              chronologies in the eastern United States. 

The dendroclimatic potential of
              black gum (Nyssa sylvatica) growing in wetlands and swamps in the northeastern
              United States will also be examined. This is one of the longest-lived hardwoods
              in the world with a documented age of 500-700 years. Preliminary analyses
              indicate that this species produces cross-datable tree rings that correlate
              significantly with summer temperatures. A small network of black gum
              chronologies will be developed to determine the feasibility of using this
              species to reconstruct past summer temperatures in excess of 500 years before
              the present.
