This is a proposal to acquire several instruments to upgrade
              analytical facilities for environmental engineering research and education. 
              The research is in the areas of separations, biological transformations, and
              chemical transformations.  This research requires a diverse array of analytical
              measurements ranging from basic analysis of contaminants of regulatory concern
              to detailed analysis of particle characteristics, chemical intermediates, and
              microbial activity.  The research is focussed on developing new and more
              efficient processes for in situ and ex situ treatment of water, soil, and air
              pollution.  Five advanced instruments, field flow fractionation, an FTIR-Raman
              spectrophotometer, a zeta potential analyzer, a thermogravimetric analysis
              system, and capillary electrophoresis would be used in the area of surface
              chemistry research.
