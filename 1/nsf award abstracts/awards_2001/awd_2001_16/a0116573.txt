MRI: 
              Acquisition of Equipment for Remote Multichannel Media Immersion

This is a
              proposal for equipment acquisition under the Major Research Instrumentation
              (MRI) program to support research and student training in immersive technology.
               Immersive technology is the creation of  the aural and visual ambience of a
              virtual space in which individuals can experience remote events or communicate
              naturally with others located remotely.
