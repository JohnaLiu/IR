              ABSTRACT

OCE-0116786


Detailed chemical composition studies of the
              distribution of preserved lipid molecular markers (also termed molecular
              'fossils' or 'fingerprints') in the sinking particulate matter of water columns
              and especially subsequently in sediments provides insight to our understanding 
              of the inputs and processing of organic matter carbon in the ocean.
              Interpretation of the stable carbon isotopic composition (d 13C) of specific
              lipid molecular markers in aged sedimentary deposits has increasingly been
              suggested as a means of constraining past ocean and climate conditions and even
              reconstructing paleo atmospheric carbon dioxide mixing ratios (pCO2). The PI
              will measure isotopic d 13C fractionation effects on selected lipids using
              controlled laboratory experiments to simulate processes reflecting those
              undergone during natural diagenesis. This investigation will address the
              otherwise default assumption that diagenetic effects are negligible. Incubation
              experiments using target lipid biomarkers obtained from  enriched 13C labeled
              algal cultures will be conducted in different biogeochemical regimes including:
              natural oxic and anoxic seawaters; simulated oxic vs. anoxic and cycled
              oxic/anoxic sediment-water interfaces; and in homogenized sediment cores with
              and without macrofauna. Compound specific isotopic analysis of biomarker
              'molecular fossils' in sediments enhances understanding of the past conditions
              experienced by the marine organisms producing such molecules. Use of lipid
              biomarker information contained in natural archives such as deep sea sediments
              is key in reconstructing past climate change and helps answer fundamental
              questions such as how fast and how much can the planet's climate change.
