This award, made through the Major Research Instrumentation
              (MRI) Program, provides support for the acquisition of a state-of-the-art
              electron microprobe (EMP) for the microchemical characterization of geological
              materials.  A new EMP will replace an aging (vintage 1981) ARL SEMQ in the
              Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Maine.   The instrument
              will facilitate research on a range of topics in metamorphic petrology
              including, the speciation of Fe and distribution of OH- in metapelites, and
              light element (i.e. Li, B, Be) partitioning in granulite facies rocks. 
              Research in paleoclimatology will also be enhanced by this instrument.  The
              probe will be used to analyze volcanic glass shards in ice core samples for
              trace and major element compositions.  Coupled with analyses of suspected
              source tephras, such chemical analyses offer the strong possibility of
              verifying the provenance of ice core tephra and therefore relating these
              discrete events to climate proxies also recorded simultaneously in ice cores. 
              This facility will be the only modern EMP in the state of Maine and will serve
              not only the needs of faculty and students from several departments at the
              University of Maine , but also the needs of faculty and students from nearby
              regional institutions (i.e. Bowdoin, Univ. of Southern Maine, Bates).
