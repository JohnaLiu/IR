Abstract    :
              Food web dynamics of benthic and pelagic ecosystems are driven, in large part,
              by communities of prokaryotes and micro-eukaryotes. The phylogenetic diversity
              of the micro-eukaryotes range from protists to various adult and larval stages
              of invertebrates. Many of these species are difficult to identify due to their
              inability to grow in culture media or due to their indistinguishable
              characteristics. Molecular techniques have been instrumental in unraveling the
              complexities and activities of these communities. The purpose of this research
              is to explore the use of ion-paired reversed phase (IP-RP) UPLC for nucleic
              acid fragment analysis, which is a system that is successfully used in
              biomedical research. If this technique is adaptable to marine research, the
              time required to identify and quantify populations will be reduced from days to
              minutes. IP-RP HPLC will be tested with four diverse research programs:
              presence of uncultured fungal populations in marine habitats; distribution of
              plant and animal pathogenic bacteria and fungi in African dust; community
              structure of copepod larvae in the Florida Bay food web, and genetic dispersal
              of Caribbean corals and reef fishes.
