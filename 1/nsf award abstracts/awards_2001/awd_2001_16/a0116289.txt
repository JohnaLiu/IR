MRI:  Acquisition of a
              Parallel Computing Facility for Computational Engineering

This is a proposal
              for equipment acquisition under the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI)
              program to support research and student training across a range of
              computational engineering activities including computational mechanics,
              computational heat transfer, computational materials science, computational
              bioengineering, computational environmental engineering, computational
              mathematics, and computer science, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary
              projects.  For example, work on shared memory in a network of processors has
              led to techniques which can be tested in a production environment in
              applications in large-scale turbulence control analyses and in molecular
              simulations of nanostructures.
