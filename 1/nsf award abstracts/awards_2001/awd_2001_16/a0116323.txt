Abstract    :
              
With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program Macalester
              College will be able to acquire a short Titanium-Sapphire laser for Terahertz
              studies of semiconductor heterostructures. The laser system will permit
              time-resolved spectroscopy of materials at terahertz and mid-infrared
              frequencies.  Initial research will use the instrument to support the Principal
              Investigator's NSF-funded program to study spin and charge dynamics in
              semiconductors (NSF-RUI DMR-0074622).  Projects will include ultrafast
              Terahertz spectroscopy of spin-dynamics in semiconductors; time-resolved
              measurements of magneto-plasma oscillations in semiconductors; and quantum
              transitions in strongly driven semiconductor quantum wells and
              heterostructures.  The equipment will also support undergraduate research
              training in Photonics and Condensed Matter Physics at Macalester
              College.

With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program
              Macalester College will be able to acquire a short Titanium-Sapphire laser for
              Terahertz studies of semiconductor heterostructures. As the switching rates in
              electronic devices are pushed to ever higher frequencies, it becomes
              increasingly important to understand carrier transport phenomena in
              semiconductors on picosecond (10-12s) and femtosecond (10-15s) time-scales.
              Using ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy it is possible to impulsively excite a
              material with a femtosecond optical pulse or single-cycle electromagnetic
              pulse, and record the resulting motion of charge in time.  This award supports
              equipment to enable time-resolved spectroscopy of materials at terahertz and
              mid-infrared frequencies. Initial research will use the instrument to support
              the Principal Investigator's NSF-funded program to study spin and charge
              dynamics in semiconductors (NSF-RUI DMR-0074622). The equipment will also
              support undergraduate research training in Photonics and Condensed Matter
              Physics at Macalester College.
