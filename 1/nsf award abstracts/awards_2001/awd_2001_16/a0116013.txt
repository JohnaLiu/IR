Abstract    :
              A collaboration with an investigator in Mexico will be fostered through this
              award sponsored, in part, by the CONACyT Program.  The properties and strengths
              of microbial adhesives will be characterized using atomic force microscopy and
              other methods.  The counterpart in Mexico at the Universidad Autonoma de
              Campeche will provide putative antagonists of microbial fouling.  Overall, an
              improved picture of biofouling will be provided as well as an exploration of
              using the natural compounds as potential replacements for synthetic adhesives.
