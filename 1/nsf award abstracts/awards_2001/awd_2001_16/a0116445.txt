Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Puerto Rico in Humacao will
              acquire a 300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Spectrometer. This equipment
              will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) structural characterization
              of organometallic intermediates; b) enzyme mechanisms in organic solutions; c)
              solution-state dynamics for semiquinones in phospholipid membranes; d) kinetics
              of photochemical degradation of membranes by radical peroxidation; e)
              structure-function relationships of molecules of biological or pharmaceutical
              interest; and f) polymer structure.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. 
              Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including biochemistry.
