Abstract    :
              This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award provides funds for the
              acquisition of an ultra high speed camera capable of recording 16 digital
              images of 1280x1024 resolution at frame rates up to 200 million frames per
              second.  The camera will be used to study material deformation and chip-tool
              interface friction in metal cutting.  

The ultra high framing rate will
              enable extension of current capabilities for determination of the velocity,
              strain and strain rate distribution in the primary and secondary shear zones in
              low speed orthogonal cutting to much higher cutting speeds.  Results will be
              used to determine material constitutive properties at high strain, strain rate
              and temperature, obtain the shear stress along the chip-tool interface, and
              verify computational models of metal cutting at high cutting speeds.  The
              camera will also be used in experiments in a second course in manufacturing
              processes.
