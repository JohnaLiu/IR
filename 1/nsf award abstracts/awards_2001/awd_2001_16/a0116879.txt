This is a planning visit proposal submitted by Dr. Bradly
              Baker, South Dakota School of Mines, to request funds are travel to China to
              finalize a research project on the effects of land use change on reactive
              biogenic compounds in the atmosphere.  He plans to develop a cooperative
              research proposal with Dr. Jianhui Bai of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics
              at the Chinese Academy of Sciences to compare the effects of developing
              grasslands into range and cropland on the regional air quality between the
              selected sites in Inner Mongolia and South Dakota.  The success of this
              research can enhance our understanding of regional air quality as a result of
              land use changes.
