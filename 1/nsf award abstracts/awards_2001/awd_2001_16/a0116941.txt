Abstract    :
              The researchers will examine the potential effect of climate warming from
              anthropogenically induced increases of atmospheric carbon dioxide on both
              Arctic and global climate.  The long-term variability of the Arctic Oscillation
              (AO) may be influenced by increased greenhouse gas concentration, and
              therefore, is important for understanding future climate response to the
              continued increase of gases.  Data from a warm, ice-free geologic period will
              be used as a proxy in a climate system model to examine what a future warmer,
              ice-free Arctic resulting from a warming similar to the one underway in the
              Arctic might be like.  The role of the AO in arctic climate and the feedback of
              arctic climate on global climate is a new area of research that has important
              implications for understanding mechanisms for global warming.  Since the Arctic
              has been warming for over a decade and the environmental response is already
              obvious, the research is a timely contribution to studies of the impacts from
              global warming.
