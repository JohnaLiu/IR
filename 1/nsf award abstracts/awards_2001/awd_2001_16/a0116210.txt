This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of
              Washington will provide support for acquisition of a high resolution
              inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer for a multi-disciplinary group of
              researchers in earth and ocean sciences.   Ongoing research programs can take
              immediate advantage of the new instrumentation, and it is expected to
              significantly enhance research capabilities for faculty and students. 
              University of Washington will contribute cost-sharing of more than 30% of the
              cost of this project from non-federal funds.
