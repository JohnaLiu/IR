Abstract    :
              Under this Major Research Instrumentation award the Principal Investigator will
              acquire a high-performance computer cluster to be used as the primary
              computational resource for the mesoscale dynamics and numerical modeling group
              within the Division of Atmospheric Sciences (DAS) at the University of Nevada. 
              The recent expansion of DAS's research scope including two National Science
              Foundation funded projects focusing on mesoscale atmospheric phenomena and
              mesoscale numerical modeling has led to an immediate need for dedicated
              computational resources to better support present and planned research
              activities.  

The acquisition of a 32-node computer cluster will be a
              significant and cost-effective expansion of the research infrastructure at DAS.
               Such a dedicated, high-speed computing platform will provide supercomputer
              performance at a fraction of the cost of a commercial supercomputer, and is
              crucial for the numerical modeling group and associated students to continue to
              conduct competitive research aimed at improving numerical weather forecasting
              within current and future projects.

The graduate student research training
              is an important part of the research enterprise at DRI.  The requested
              equipment will provide an environment to extensively train students pursuing
              advanced degrees in the Atmospheric Sciences Program.  It will foster a closer
              collaboration between the Computer and Atmospheric Science Departments.  In the
              long term, the equipment is expected to provide a focal point for
              interdisciplinary collaboration and, especially, facilitate a wider adoption of
              high-performance parallel computing in earth sciences at the University of
              Nevada.
