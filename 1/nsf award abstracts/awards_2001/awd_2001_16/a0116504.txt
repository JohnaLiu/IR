ABSTRACT

An electron beam lithography (EBL) system (JEOL
              JBX-5000LS) will be acquired for nanoscience and nanotechnology research and
              education at the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin).  EBL is the
              standard method for defining structural features on substrates with dimensions
              of 100 nm or less.  This EBL instrument will aid ongoing research in a diverse
              range of fields including resist-material development, which includes efforts
              to use EBL-defined structures for applications in microelectromechanical
              systems (MEMS-both microfluidics and sensors), characterization of electrically
              erasable and programmable read-only memories (EEPROM), and fundamental studies
              of mesoscopic physics in nanostructures, such as silicon nanowires and carbon
              nanotubes.  UT Austin is also a leader in the area of bionanoelectronics, with
              the development of new evolutionarily engineered peptides for electronic
              materials processing, and interfacing EBL will aid these efforts.  The
              acquisition of the EBL instrument will help promote an environment where
              students with diverse backgrounds work together to make small structures for
              future technologies.  

UT Austin, as an institution, has recognized the
              critical need for on-site EBL.  The Texas Materials Institute (TMI), the Center
              for Nano- and Molecular Science and Technology (CNM), the Microelectronics
              Research Center (MRC), the College of Engineering, and the Departments of
              Chemical Engineering, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Physics have committed
              $466K in matching funds toward the instrument purchase along with support for a
              full-time technician at a salary of $70K per year.  The instrument will be
              managed through the MRC and located in the cleanroom (12,000 square feet of
              class 100 and class 1000 space) at the Pickel Research Campus at UT Austin
              where it will greatly strengthen and complement the existing microfabrication
              and nanofabrication facilities.
