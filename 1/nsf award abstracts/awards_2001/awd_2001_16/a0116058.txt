Abstract    :
              This proposal will result in a Large Angle Beamstrahlung Monitor at CESR, an
              electron positron collider. Colliders have become the tool of choice for
              frontier experiments in particle physics. The technique proposed here has the
              potential to provide a wealth of information about beam overlap at the
              collision point of colliders which can result in substantially higher
              luminosity, which means more data on the rare processes of interest. In
              addition to improving the performance of a collider, which is of direct
              interest to the particle physics experimenters, extracting the information from
              the beam overlap could lead to improvements in the understanding of the
              beam-beam interaction. This idea, if can be made viable, will have application
              in many colliding beam accelerators.
