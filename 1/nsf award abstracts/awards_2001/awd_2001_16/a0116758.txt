Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at San Diego State University will acquire a liquid
              chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS). This equipment will
              enhance research in the following areas:  a) the development of methods for
              analyzing air- and/or water-sensitive materials; and studies of b)
              organometallic complexes and polymers containing two or more metals; c)
              organometallic complexes of proteins and peptides; d) protein and peptide
              interactions with DNA; and e) supramolecular interactions of electrogenerated
              radical anions with hydrogen-bond donors .  

Liquid chromatography with mass
              spectrometric detection (LC-MS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the
              separation and analysis of complex mixtures.  This instrument will have an
              impact in the areas of chemistry, materials science and biochemistry.
