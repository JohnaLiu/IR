These studies focus on fundamental mechanisms and
              applications of nanometer scale surface manipulation involving combined
              stimuli, where the tip of a scanning force microscope stimulates the surface in
              the presence of an aggressive chemical solution.  These combined stimuli can
              make and break bonds and reorganize material on surfaces of single crystals,
              glasses, and polymers in a highly localized fashion.  We will examine the role
              of crystalline and other structural defects (e.g., steps, kinks, vacancies, and
              nanostructures generated by the tip) in dissolution and growth to identify the
              rate limiting steps (with and without stimulation by the SFM tip) and how they
              depend on stress, solution chemistry, and temperature.  These results will be
              related to fundamental physical and chemical parameters governing dissolution
              and growth, such as activation energies and volume/entropic factors.  We also
              will examine how the apparently random mechanical vibrations in cantilevers
              during scanning might be related to transient surface phenomena in
              supersaturated solutions.  These studies have considerable promise in the
              development of new methods for generating atomically flat surfaces,
              constructing novel nanometer structures, and producing textured surfaces for
              bonding and chemically active arrangements.  The studies also support atomic
              level understanding of the technologically important process of chemical
              mechanical polishing (CMP), where the SFM tip serves as a model abrasive
              particle.  Sensor development, MEMS, and development of new biologically active
              substrates and surfaces will benefit from the improved molecular-level
              understanding of dissolution and growth resulting from this work.
