This award, made through the Major Research
              Instrumentation Program, provides partial support for the acquisition of a low
              vacuum scanning electron microscope (LV SEM). The principal investigators
              include four faculty members from three different departments in the College of
              Liberal Arts and Sciences at Northern Illinois University.  Principal
              applications of the LV SEM by the PIs include: studies of glacial-sedimentary
              processes and polar plankton biostratigraphy and evolution entailing
              examination of microstructures in subglacial sediments; studies in the
              environmental biogeosciences, including analysis of the spatial distribution of
              microorganisms involved in biodegradation of organic solvents; studies of
              modern soils and Quaternary paleosols to examine their current and historic
              ability to sequester carbon; studies in plant morphology and systematics,
              ethnobotany, conservation biology, and botanical biocomplexity; and
              applications in educational programs, including research training,
              undergraduate coursework, and community outreach education programs.  The
              instrument to be purchased is the JEOL 5600LV, which can operate at either high
              vacuum or low vacuum, with the Noran Vantage DSI spectral imaging system X-ray
              analyzer (EDS). Samples for observation require virtually no pretreatment, and
              large samples (up to 15 cm) can be imaged without gold-coating. This is a
              non-destructive method, perfect for examination of unique specimens, such as
              holotypes or artifacts, and wet or outgassing samples can be directly analyzed.
