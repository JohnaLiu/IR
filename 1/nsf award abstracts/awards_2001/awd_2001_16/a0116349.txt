Abstract    :
              A computer cluster is being developed to support the University of Richmond (UR)
              research program in electromagnetic nuclear physics at the Thomas Jefferson
              National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab).
The system will consist of 50
              slave nodes, a master node, and a 3-TByte RAID file server. Each of the slave
              computing nodes will have two 1-GHz Pentium III processors, 512 MBytes of RAM,
              and a 20-GByte hard disk. The computers will run the Linux operating system and
              will be configured on a local area network through a high-speed switch. The
              master node will be used to manage the execution of batch jobs and to act as a
              firewall to restrict access to the system and reduce network traffic among the
              nodes of the cluster. The cluster is modeled after a prototype system that was
              developed at UR and has been running successfully for the past two years. The
              system will be used for data analysis and Monte-Carlo simulations for the CEBAF
              Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) Collaboration in Hall B at Jefferson Lab.
              The goal of the CLAS
research program is to study baryon and meson structure
              and spectroscopy, gluonic degrees of freedom, and multinucleon correlations in
              nuclei.
