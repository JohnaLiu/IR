Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of California in San Diego will
              acquire a High Resolution Mass Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas including a) transition metal-mediated chemistry
              of alkynes; b) the development of novel peptidomimetic structures with
              interesting biological properties; c) the use of directed chemical synthesis to
              elucidate problems in physical organic chemistry; d) the development of
              fluorescent chemosensors; and e) the preparation of large and small metal
              clusters.  

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate
              structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of
              organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The results from these
              studies will have an impact in a number of areas including the development of
              new catalysts.
