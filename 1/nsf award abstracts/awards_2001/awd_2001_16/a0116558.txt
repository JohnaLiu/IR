"CARMA -
              Development of a Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave
              Astronomy"

This program will begin the process of merging two
              millimeter-wavelength radio astronomy arrays currently funded by AST's
              University Radio Observatories program into a single interferometer at a new
              site, to be called CARMA (Combined Array for Millimeter-wave Astronomy).  The
              observatories are the Owens Valley Millimeter Array (6 x 10m telescopes) and
              the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) Array (9 x 6m telescopes).
              The new array will be sited in the Inyo Mountains of central-eastern
              California, near the present Owens Valley site but higher in elevation.   
              Improved atmospheric conditions at the new site will allow routine observations
              in the prime 1.3mm observing band.  CARMA will be the world's premier
              millimeter-wavelength interferometer until the advent of ALMA.  The scientific
              advantages of a combined array are many, including greater sensitivity, more
              usable days per year (because of the higher site), and far better image
              fidelity. The funds awarded will be used for long lead-time items such as
              broadband electronics, correlator (signal combiner) prototyping, and an antenna
              transporter.  CARMA received the recommendation of the Astronomy Decadal Survey
              of the National Research Council as one of the Moderate-cost Initiatives to be
              constructed during 2000 - 2010.
