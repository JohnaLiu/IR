Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Northern Arizona University will acquire a High
              Resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer for Research in
              Chemistry and Earth Sciences. This equipment will enhance research in a number
              of areas including a) atmospheric source apportionment using isotopic
              signatures of lead; b) arsenic speciation in the aquatic environment; c)
              isotopic studies of lead, thorium and uranium in the environment; d) aqueous
              geochemistry; and e) genotoxicity of chromium (VI).  

Mass spectrometry (MS)
              is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the
              molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and
              organometallic molecules. The results from these studies will have an impact in
              a number of areas, especially environment chemistry and human health.
