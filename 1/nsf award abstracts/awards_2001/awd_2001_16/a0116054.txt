Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at John Carroll University will acquire Isothermal
              Titration and Differential Scanning Calorimetry Instruments. This equipment
              will enhance research in a number of areas including a) characterization of the
              effect of nonpolar solutes on coulombic interactions; b) organic and
              organoalkali structure and reactivity; c) determination of protein structure at
              solid/liquid interfaces and examination of sol-gel synthetic routes to alumina
              films; d) measurement of binding strengths of various metals to organometallic
              fragments; and e) analysis of surfaces of powders.  

Differential Scanning
              Calorimetry (DSC) is an extremely useful tool in modern analytical chemistry. 
              Calorimetric analysis is used to measure the thermal energy (heat) exchange
              that occurs during molecular interactions and reactions.  Thus DSC  provides a
              very reliable and sensitive method for determining the thermodynamic properties
              of materials such as changes in heat capacity of liquid and solid samples.
