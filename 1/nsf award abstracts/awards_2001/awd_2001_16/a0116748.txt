Abstract    :
              This is a Major Research Instrumentation award to enhance the existing
              instrumentation at Utah State University's Bear Lake Observatory.  Upgrades
              will be made to the Fabry-Perot Interferometer, the Imaging Doppler
              Interferometer, and the all-sky imager.  The instruments will be used to study
              the coupling between atmospheric regions and long-term trends in the
              mesosphere, lower thermosphere, and ionosphere.  The Bear Lake Observatory
              provide data from a unique vantage point in the heart of the Rocky Mountains,
              which are a likely source for many of the gravity waves that influence the
              dynamics of the middle atmosphere.  The improved instrumentation will establish
              BLO as a key site for investigating long-term changes in the mid-latitude
              mesosphere and thermosphere.  The new data will add to and strengthen the
              existing database that has been built up during the past decade, and the
              facility will provide key validation and correlative measurements for current
              and future space-based missions.
