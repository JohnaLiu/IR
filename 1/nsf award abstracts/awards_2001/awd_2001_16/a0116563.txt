Abstract    :
              The Goshen College Physics Department is stepping into a new area of research
              and teaching in the holographic study of vibrating objects. This represents a
              deliberate new direction for our well-established undergraduate research
              program. Our aim is to move into an area of great value to students and to
              carry out a research program that is intrinsically interesting, pedagogically
              useful, and connects us to local industry including musical instrument
              manufacturers.

We propose to study the vibration modes of musical
              instruments using an electronic holography system (often called TV holography).
              Such a system can create an image of a vibrating object decorated with a
              pattern of fringes, which show the vibration mode. We will also use finite
              element analysis (FEA) to model the vibration of these musical instruments. By
              comparing with the holographic results and refining the model, we will build an
              accurate FEA model, which can be used to try out new possibilities.

The
              Goshen College Physics Department has a history of serving certain local
              industries with our x-ray diffraction expertise. Similarly an
              electronic-holography system will provide a nondestructive testing capability
              that will be of value providing studies of stress-strain deformation and
              location of hairline cracks and defects. This capability will be a valuable
              addition to internship opportunities for our (binary) engineering students.
