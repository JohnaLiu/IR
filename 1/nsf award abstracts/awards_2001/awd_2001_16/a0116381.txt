Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Scranton will acquire a gas
              chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS). This equipment will
              enhance research in a number of areas including a) microwave accelerated
              preparation and reactions of tricyclic and tetracyclicazepines using room
              temperature ionic liquids as solvents; b) studies on the presence of
              polychlorinated biphenyls and other organic compounds in the Lackawanna River;
              c) development of environmentally-suited methods for chemical synthesis and
              processing; and d) determination of polyphenols in common fruits.  The GC/MS
              will also be used in advanced laboratory courses and by faculty at other
              universities in the area.  

Gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric
              detection (GC-MS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation
              and analysis of complex mixtures.  This instrument will have an impact in a
              number of areas, in particular environmental and synthetic organic chemistry.
