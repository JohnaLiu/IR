Abstract    :
              Partial funding is provided for the support of a workshop (Gordon Research
              Conference) on coastal ocean circulation.  Twenty-two invited talks and a
              series of contributed poster presentations will be made.  These will cover a
              breadth of topics in coastal ocean circulation occurring on a variety of space
              and time scales.  Related topics in coastal meteorology and
              biogeochemical-physical interactions will also be discussed.  The priority use
              of the funds is to defray travel and attendance costs for young investigators.
