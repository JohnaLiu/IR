              ABSTRACT

OCE-0116955

The ultimate source of Os into the modern ocean is
              only partially constrained. At issue is whether radiogenic Os is derived from
              average upper continental crust or whether Os is the result of weathering of
              organic-rich sedimentary rocks.  For this reason, a PI from the University of
              Maryland will develop the 190Pt-186Os isotope system as a tracer of chemical
              input into the oceans by carrying out the following research:  (1) constrain
              the 186Os/188Os of the modern ocean via analysis of young oceanic Mn-nodules
              and oxidized metalliferous sediments; (2) constrain the average 186Os/188Os of
              the continental crust via the analysis of loess and freshwater Mn-concretions
              from a variety of locations in the United States, Europe and Asia; and (3)
              constrain the average evolution of 186Os/188Os in organic-rich sediments via
              the analysis black shales from the Proterozoic Chelmsford/Onwatin and Virginia
              Formations, Cambrian shales from the Hunan Province in China and Devonian
              shales from the Yukon Territory of Canada.  Once these analysis have been
              completed and if any analytically discernable differences are confirmed between
              the 186Os/188Os ratio of felsic crust and organic-rich sediments, then the PI
              also will determine the evolution of 186Os/188Os in Cenozoic seawater via
              analysis of metalliferous sediments of known age.
