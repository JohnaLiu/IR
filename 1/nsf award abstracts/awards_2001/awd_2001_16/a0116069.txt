Sanudo-Wilhelmy
This Major Research Instrumentation award to State
              University of New York at Stony Brook will provide support for acquisition of a
              high resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer with laser
              ablation and chromatography systems for a multi-disciplinary group of
              researchers in several academic departments and the Marine Sciences Research
              Center.   Ongoing research programs can take immediate advantage of the new
              instrumentation, and it is expected to significantly enhance research
              capabilities for faculty and students.  SUNY Stony Brook will contribute
              cost-sharing of 30% of the cost of this project from non-federal funds.
