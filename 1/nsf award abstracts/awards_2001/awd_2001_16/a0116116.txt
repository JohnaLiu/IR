Abstract    :
              Brookhaven National Laboratory is hosting a workshop on May 30-31, 2001 to
              promote the formation of research partnerships between college and university
              faculty in designated EPSCoR states and the scientific staff from Department of
              Energy (DOE) laboratories and facilities.  The workshop is sponsored by the DOE
              Office of Basic Energy Sciences EPSCoR program and is co-sponsored by the
              National Science Foundation EPSCoR Program.
The primary objective of the
              meeting is to provide a forum for research scientists from EPSCoR states to: 
              (1) report advances in EPSCoR funded research activities, (2) update their
              knowledge of Department of Energy programs and initiatives, (3) learn about BNL
              National User Faciliti4es and research directions, (5) develop plans for future
              research projects, and (6) learn about DOE laboratory opportunities for
              training and hands-on research experience for undergraduate, graduate,
              postdoctoral fellows and new faculty.
