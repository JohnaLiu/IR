Abstract

The PI and four colleagues in the Mechanical
              Engineering and the Chemical  Engineering Departments request funding for the
              purchase of a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM).  This
              instrument will be used in their research in particle technology.  It will
              enhance their capability to characterize particles at nano and submicron
              scales.  When such data are incorporated into their predictive numerical model,
              better results are anticipated.  The institutional support of NJIT is very
              strong with cost-sharing at ~50% level.
