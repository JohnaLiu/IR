Abstract    :
              This project proposes to develop an application delivery system, in
              collaboration with the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), which
              will provide real-time distance learning opportunities.  This system will be
              created by:

(1)	Establishing a high-speed, high-bandwidth Internet2 gateway
              at the Texas A&M University (TAMU) Center at UNAM
(2)	Connecting the Texas A&M
              University Virtual Networking Lab to the gateway
(3)	Linking distance learning
              studios at Texas A&M University and UNAM

The user population for the project
              is as diverse as the institution's populations and includes:

(1)	Texas A&M
              University Educational Broadcasting Services
(2)	Texas A&M University
              Architecture Study Abroad students and faculty
(3)	Texas A&M University Latin
              American Study Program
(4)	Texas A&M University Chemistry
              Department
(5)	DGSCA-UNAM
(6)	Mexican students in U.S. continuing education
              programs
(7)	Mexican networking students and personnel needing hands-on
              continuing networking education.
