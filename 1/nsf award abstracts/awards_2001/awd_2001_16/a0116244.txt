Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at City University of New York/Hunter College  will
              acquire a X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector for small molecule
              diffractometry. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including the following: a) self-assembly of nano-scaled, solid-state photonic
              materials; b) lanthanide polyoxometalates:  building blocks for new materials;
              c) polyoxometalate anions and metalloenzyme mimics; d) redox-mediated
              chiroptical materials; e) synthetic carbohydrate chemistry; f) chiral
              phosphorus ligands and antisense oligonucleotides; g) complexes formed by bile
              acids, cholesterol and other steroids with cyclodextrin derivatives and
              synthetic receptors; h) quantum crystallography of molecules; and i) study of
              geometry and electronic environment of metal sites by solid state NMR and X-ray
              crystallography.

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise
              measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including
              bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about the
              spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. 
              These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, including materials
              chemistry and biochemistry.
