The overall objective of the proposed exploratory study is to
              develop a novel high resolution spectroscopic imaging technique that utilizes
              light, elastically scattered from epithelial tissues in near backward
              direction, to extract information about macroscopic tissue composition as well
              as tissue structure at the cellular and sub-cellular scale. The specific aims
              are as follows:

1. Experimental system. Develop an experimental high
              resolution imaging system for imaging superficial layers of turbid media, which
              uses both spectral and angular information to study tissue phantoms, cells, and
              sub-cellular organelles. Develop experimental techniques capable of separating
              single scattered and multiply scattered light and extracting morphological
              information from tissue.

2. Modeling. Develop mathematical models that
              describe light scattering from individual sub-cellular organelles, cells and
              extra-cellular tissues. Identify spectroscopic signatures of sub-cellular
              organelles, and develop a mathematical procedure for extracting physical
              properties of those organelles, such as size distribution, refractive indices
              and absorption coefficients.

3. Experimental studies. Study wavelength and
              angular dependence of single and multiple scattering from individual cells,
              sub-cellular organelles, and cell monolayers. Develop methods based on spatial
              distribution of scattered light to obtain information about degree of
              organization/disorganization of superficial tissues and use this information to
              reconstruct structural images of tissue on a cellular scale.
