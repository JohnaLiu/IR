Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Bates College will acquire two gas chromatographs,
              one with mass spectrometric detection and one with flame ionization detection.
              This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including a) the
              study of molecular mechanisms of metalloenzyme-mediated alkane transformations
              in the environment; b) studies of tributyl tin levels in organisms and their
              effects on gross morphological changes in snails; and c) the analysis of
              biomolecules (lipids, lignin, phenols, amino acids) in the sedimentary and
              fossil record for paleoenvironmental applications.  

Gas chromatograph with
              mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS) or gas chromatography with flame
              ionization detection (GC-FID) is an extremely powerful technique used for the
              separation and analysis of complex mixtures.  This instrument will
              substantially strengthen scientific research within the multidisciplinary
              Environmental Studies program at Bates College, and will also encourage
              collaboration between researchers in Chemistry, Biology, and Geology.
