Abstract    :
              This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI)Program grant provides funds to procure
              a high-power CO2 laser system for research and education in manufacturing and
              materials processing.  The laser system consists of five major functional
              components, including a laser generation unit, optics and beam delivery system,
              a chiller and cooling system, gas control and supply system, and motion and
              control system.  The equipment will allow both fundamental and applied research
              in:   (1) Welding of High-Strength Aluminum Alloys; (2) Welding of Zinc-Coated
              Steels; (3) Dual Beam Welding and Cutting; (4) The Formation of Striations in
              Cutting; (5) Cladding of Functionally Graded Thermal Barrier Coating; (6)
              Laser-Aided Sheet Metal Forming/Bending; (7) Surface Treating of Metals; (8)
              Laser-Material Interactions and Keyhole Formation;  (9) Sintering of Ceramic
              Coating and Metal Films; and (10) Process Modeling and Real Time Control.
              

Availability of the equipment will enable the institution to create new
              research capabilities and opportunities, to enrich the teaching of several
              senior and graduate courses, to stimulate cross-disciplinary teamwork, and to
              enhance university-industry-government collaborations.  Faculty members and
              graduate and undergraduate students from several academic departments will form
              interdisciplinary teams to conduct the aforementioned research projects using
              the acquired laser system.
