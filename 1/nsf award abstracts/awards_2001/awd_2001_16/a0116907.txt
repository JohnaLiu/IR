The objective of
              the proposed research is to obtain by experimental means the characteristics of
              the flow in the separation/reattachment zone of a three-dimensional boundary
              layer.  Such a flow is to be generated downstream of a backward facing step on
              an axisymmetric body.  Surface stresses will be measure by a
              Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) instrument to be developed by the PI. 
              The data will be made available to the fluid dynamics community as bench marks
              for the DNS and LES computations and the testing of turbulence models for such
              complex flows.
