Abstract    :
              This project uses a "three study" design to examine the response of police to
              protests in the United States more generally and New York State more
              specifically during the years from 1960-1980.  The first study uses an existing
              protest data set and statistical methods to evaluate explanations of the
              presence of police at protest actions, their use of force, the number of
              arrests, and the number of deaths.  The explanations focus on the threat and
              power of the protesters, but also consider the socio-legal environment in which
              the protests and police action take place.  The second study uses the same
              data, but different statistical methods, to examine the effects of protest
              timing on the several components of police response.  The third study collects
              original data on protest policing policies, legal decisions, and police
              training practices to understand the context of police decisions.  By combining
              the quantitative results from the first two studies with the qualitative
              results from the last study, the project provides information on how both
              characteristics of the protests and the organizational environment shape
              efforts by police to repress social movements.
