Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Saginaw Valley State University will acquire a
              liquid chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection. The research to be
              carried out using this instrument will define and follow the health of the
              Saginaw Bay Watershed in response to an EPA Superfund cleanup of a toxic waste
              site on the Pine River.  The scientific objectives to be addressed include a)
              measurement of toxics in the sediment and water column; b) bioaccumulation of
              pollutants; c) impact of the pollutants on genetic diversity; d) methods for
              remediation; and e) methods for characterization of types of microorganisms. 
              Students from this primarily undergraduate institution will be heavily involved
              in the research effort.  

Liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric
              detection (LC-MS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation
              and analysis of complex mixtures.  This instrument will substantially
              strengthen scientific research within the Earth Sciences discipline at Saginaw
              Valley State University.
