              ABSTRACT

OCE-0116185

A researcher from the University of California-San
              Diego proposes to continue his studies on the calcium (Ca) cycle in the ocean
              by making additional measurements of Ca inputs and outputs.  Initially, the PI
              will measure the Ca isotopic composition of additional river water samples to
              increase the available database and help constrain the present-day river input
              of Ca.  In addition, results from these samples will be used to assess whether
              the lithology and maturity of the drainage basin affects the Ca isotopic
              composition of river samples and if adsorption of Ca onto clays influences the
              isotopic signal.  Next, Dr. Macdougall plans to collaborate with Dr. Paytan at
              Stanford to ascertain if barite samples record the Ca isotopic composition of
              seawater without the fractionation observed in biogenic carbonate.  Lastly, the
              PI will analyze samples of a single foraminifera (Globigerinoides sacculifer)
              in downcore sediments from ODP Site 806 in the western Equatorial Pacific which
              document the Quaternary oxygen isotopic record, to determine whether Ca
              isotopes can be used as a paleo-temperature proxy.
