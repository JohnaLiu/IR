MRI: 
              Acquisition of SMP Clusters for Supporting Shared-Memory Metacomputing

This
              is a proposal for equipment acquisition under the Major Research
              Instrumentation (MRI) program to support research and student training in the
              development of high-performance distributed computing systems.  The goal is to
              develop efficient system software for supporting a seamless programming
              environment on symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) clusters.
