Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University in Camden will acquire a300 MHz
              nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Spectrometer with multinuclear capabilities
              and a variable temperature control module. This equipment will enable
              researchers to carry out studies on a) synthesis of fluorinated organic
              compounds; b) characterization of various monomers and their corresponding
              precursors; and c) the catalytic mechanisms of lipoamide dehydrogenase by
              probing native and mutated enzymes with and without substrate.  The
              investigators will also integrate the NMR spectrometer into several
              undergraduate and graduate level courses.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. 
              Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry and biochemistry.
