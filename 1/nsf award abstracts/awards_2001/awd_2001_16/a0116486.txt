Abstract

The PI and three colleagues in the
              Mechanical Engineering Department at MIT request funding to purchase imaging
              instrumentation for the renovation of the Hatsopoulos Microfluids Laboratory. 
              The instrumentation is to be used by the four faculty members who are
              associated with this laboratory (a) for the development and application of
              diagonostic techniques permitting noninvasive study of fundamental scientific
              fluid phenomena at microscale, and (b) to develop and optimize applications
              based on understanding of such phenomena.
