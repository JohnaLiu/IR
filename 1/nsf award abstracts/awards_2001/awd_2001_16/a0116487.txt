This award made through the Major Research Instrumentation
              (MRI) Program, provides support for the acquisition of a suite of instruments
              to be used in biogeochemical research on surface waters from anthropogenically
              impacted and pristine rivers in the Piedmont of the southeastern U.S. 
              Researchers and students at Furman University in Greenville, SC in addition to
              students and faculty from other liberal arts institutions that are a part of
              the Associated Colleges of the South, will have access to the following: an
              autoanalyzer for measurement of nutrient concentrations (i.e. NO3-, PO43-);  a
              coulometer system for the determination of the organic carbon load in natural
              waters; and a fluorometer for the measurement of chlorophyll a.  This
              instrumentation will complement existing analytical instruments at Furman and
              will advance teaching and training of undergraduate students in the
              southeastern U.S. with modern analytical methods in aqueous
              geochemistry.
