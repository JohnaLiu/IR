Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Bowdoin College will acquire a Fourier transform ion
              cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer equipped with external
              matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electron ionization
              (EI) sources.  Faculty at Bowdoin College, Bates College and the University of
              Southern Maine will have access to this equipment, which will enhance research
              in a number of areas including a) studies of gas-phase ion-molecule reactions;
              b) identification of biological, polymeric, and organometallic synthetic
              targets; and c) characterization of samples that include neurons from marine
              invertebrates, plant pigment extracts, soil samples, and oil residues from
              archaeological collections.    

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used
              to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions
              of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. This
              instrument will serve as a vehicle to educate students and faculty about the
              new technologies of MALDI and FT-ICR mass spectrometry.  In addition, because
              this instrumental technique is well suited for the analysis of a wide range of
              samples, the FT-ICR will catalyze new approaches to research and new research
              activities in disciplines such as neuroscience, ecology, biology, environmental
              studies and archaeology.
