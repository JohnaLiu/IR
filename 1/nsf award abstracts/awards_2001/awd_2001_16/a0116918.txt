Abstract    :
              Scientific discourses about sexuality in old age from this period thus implies
              associations between aging and disease, highly gendered preconceptions about
              the character of the elderly, powerful biological-functionalist models for
              sexual behavior, and uncertainty about the role of the elderly from a
              social-Darwinist perspective, all of which served to render late-life sexuality
              a problematic topic for contemporaries. One product of this network of ideas
              was the stereotype of the senile sex offender, or the "dirty old man," a
              development the researcher plans to treat in depth. She argues that the image
              of the villainous, lascivious elder was partly a product of wide spread sex
              reform and social hygiene campaigns at the turn of the twentieth century, and
              partly a product of the popular imagination as manifest in the popular press of
              the time. Further examination of the image of the aged sex offender and how the
              different national historical contexts varied (or didn't) requires additional
              research. The researcher is requesting funds for research in Paris and London
              where she will examine both court records and the popular press, in particular
              newspapers, which covered legal proceedings and sex reform movements.
