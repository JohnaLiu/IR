Abstract    :
              Abstract:


A two-dimensional phase Doppler particle analyzer is required. 
              This is used in an investigation of fuel sprays and air mixing in lean
              direct-injection four-stroke spark-ignition engines; a study of fuel/air mixing
              in a cold-start port-injected spark-ignition engine; the development of an
              understanding of how oxygenates blended in diesel fuel impact in-cylinder spray
              combustion characteristics and pollutant formation; experiments on and modeling
              of port injection processes including spray/wall impingement, backflow,
              microexplosion, and particle dispersion; and an experimental study of particle
              dispersion in the turbulent wake of a cylinder.
