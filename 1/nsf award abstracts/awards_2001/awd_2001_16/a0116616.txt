MRI:  Development of
              Haptic Instrumentation and Software for Computer Science Research and Training
              Using Surgical Simulation as the Application

This is a proposal for
              instrumentation development under the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI)
              program to support research and student training in the area of haptic
              human-computer interaction using surgical simulation as the application.  The
              design and development of haptic surgical instruments which attach to a
              commercially available device will enable users to practice virtual surgery and
              will enhance the human-computer interface in realistic simulation applications.
