Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Brown University will acquire a high resolution
              magnetic sector mass spectrometer. This equipment will be used to analyze a
              broad range of chemical and biochemical samples that include compounds
              resulting from organic synthesis, enzyme inhibitors, high-molecular weight
              hydrocarbons, neurochemicals, carbohydrates, peptides and organometallics, as
              well as organic chemicals from lake sediments.  

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a
              technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular
              compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic
              molecules. The results from these studies will have an impact in a number of
              areas including environmental chemistry and biochemistry.
