The shallow water and hydrostatic approximations do not
              hold for deep convection, implying that the horizontal component of the earth's
              rotation cannot be neglected.  This proposal is to support work to determine
              how convection in a system where the gravity and rotation vectors are parallel
              differ from one in which they are not?  Preliminary experiments in the latter
              type of system suggest an eastward advection of the convecting region and
              general sinking of fluid along a wedge between the directions of gravity and
              rotation.  Two modes of sinking are identified:  blobs sink parallel to gravity
              and leave behind tails parallel to the rotation axis while curtains sink
              parallel to the rotation axis.  Laboratory experiments will be performed to
              determine the dependence of the characteristics of convection on a
              three-dimensional parameter space defined by the rotation, the buoyancy flux,
              and the angle between the rotation and gravity vectors.  The PI will also
              compare the lab results with the output of the MIT model in a hope of verifying
              one of the many proposed parameterizations present in the model.
