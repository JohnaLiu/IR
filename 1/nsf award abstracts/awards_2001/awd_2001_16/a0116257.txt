Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at DeSales University will acquire a 60 MHz NMR
              Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a)
              organic synthesis of ionic solvents and study of reactions using these
              solvents; b) aerosol preparation of metal oxides and organic polymer systems;
              and c) controlled-release kinetics of drug molecules from a microcrystalline
              cellulose matrix.  This instrument will also be used in advanced undergraduate
              courses.  Students will be heavily involved in the research projects at this
              primarily undergraduate institution.  

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. 
              Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier research.
