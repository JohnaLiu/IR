Abstract    :
              Through this Major Research Instrumentation award, physicists at Agnes Scott
              College, in collaboration with electrical engineers at Georgia Institute of
              Technology, are developing a lidar system (Light Detection and Ranging) for
              atmospheric research.  Students will construct the instrument under the
              supervision of faculty members from Agnes Scott and Georgia Tech, and will
              operate it routinely over a period of several years.  The objective is to
              provide hands-on experience for undergraduates, in particular undergraduate
              women, in state-of-the-art equipment design and research.  Scientific
              applications include measuring the optical properties of clouds, studying the
              vertical structure and variability of the stratospheric aerosol layer, and
              monitoring low-level haze and pollution over the site of the instrument in
              Atlanta.  The lidar is based on a diode-pumped solid state laser.  It produces
              visible (green) light and is eye-safe even at close range.  It is of a simple
              design, appropriate for an undergraduate teaching environment.  Though the
              research application is atmospheric science, the experience of designing and
              constructing the instrument will familiarize the students with elements of
              engineering, data processing, and optical remote sensing.
