MRI:  Acquisition of
              Computing and Peripheral Hardware to Support Collaborative Research and
              Undergraduate Research Education in Virtual Reality

This is a proposal for
              equipment acquisition under the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program to
              support research and student training in virtual reality.  The virtual reality
              effort will provide a platform for the investigation of human motion planning
              and the development of computational models to enable high fidelity object
              manipulation within a virtual environment.
