Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Reed College will acquire a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic
              resonance (NMR) spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry
              out studies on a) enzyme mechanisms through magnetization tansfer; b) synthesis
              of transition-state mimics; c) natural product synthesis; and d) mechanistic
              and structural studies of sugar isomerases.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. 
              Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier research.
