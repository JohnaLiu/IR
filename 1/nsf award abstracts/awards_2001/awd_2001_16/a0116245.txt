Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Southern Oregon University will acquire a 400 MHz
              NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies
              on a) structural elucidation of new conotoxins; b) the identification of the
              components of deer tarsal glands; and c) structural characterization of
              synthetic intermediates.  The instrument will also be used in a number of
              advanced undergraduate courses.  Students will be heavily involved in the
              research projects at this primarily undergraduate institution.  

Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
              identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms
              within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules
              in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
              studies will have an impact in a number of areas including synthetic chemistry
              and biochemistry.
