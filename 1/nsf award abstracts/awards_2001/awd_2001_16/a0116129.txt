This project seeks to better understand the generation
              mechanism for the Earth's magnetic field.   This Major Research Instrumentation
              grant will fund development of a new device designed to self-generate magnetic
              fields at parameters close to the Earth.  This new device will drive liquid
              sodium to flow in a three-meter spherical tank.  The tank and the enclosed
              propellors rotate independently to drive a sodium flow to stretch and amplify
              magnetic fields.  The goal is to better understand the saturation mechanism
              which determines the strength of the Earth's field, as well as characterize the
              dynamics of a saturated self-generating dynamo state (such as reversals).  New
              diagnostics are planned to better characterize the fluctuations in the magnetic
              field and the fluid velocity, including ultrasound velocimetry, spherical
              magnetic field sensors, and a magnetic field imaging array.  The effects of
              rotation and Lorentz forces on the velocity and magnetic fields are specific
              issues these diagnostics will probe.   This scientific exploration seeks to
              shed light on the dynamics of field self-generation on a wide variety of
              objects showing active fields (the Earth, the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Io) as well
              as those lacking self-generation such as Venus.
