Title: 
              "Acquisition of Materials Testing Systems for Multiple Usage Including
              Multi-Axial Fatigue Analysis

 Abstract:

The research equipment being
              acquired through this grant is a 100 KN Servo Hydraulic Axial Tension - Torsion
              Materials Testing System (MTS) with an environmental chamber and other
              supporting facilities for measuring crack propagation rates and characterizing
              material microstructures.   On-going research projects and the mission to
              strengthen the graduate engineering education program at Alfred University led
              to this acquisition.

Results from multi-axial fatigue tests of A356 aluminum
              alloy conducted previously by this PI and a multi-scale computational and
              microstructure-based fatigue analytical modeling effort conducted in
              conjunction with Dr. McDowell of Georgia Tech and Dr. Horstemeyer of Sandia
              National Labs show great potential for increasing fatigue life of particular
              aluminum alloys.  These instruments will allow the extension of those results
              to industry.

The new equipment will be used by faculty members and students
              at Alfred University.  They will also be used by members of the USCAR/USAMP
              team and companies and colleges in western New York State.  Besides the
              above-mentioned projects, the planned activities include:
- Modeling and
              analysis of electrostrictive, piezoelectric, and ferroelectric ceramics.
-
              Damage and failure analysis of carbon-carbon composites under complex
              loading.
- Testing of non-proportional cyclic plasticity of metals and
              light-weight alloys.
- Analysis behavior of brittle materials such as glass,
              ceramics, and concrete.
- Mechanical behavior characterization and multi-scale
              analysis of bio-materials.
- Environmental effects on material behavior, such
              as moisture and temperature effects.
Courses such as Fatigue, Fracture, and
              Mechanical Behavior of Engineering Materials.
