Abstract    :
              Endocytosis is required for the uptake of essential nutrients from the
              extracellular environment as well as to retrieve proteins and lipids that are
              added to the plasma membrane during fusion of regulated and constitutive
              secretory vesicles. A role for the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis has been
              controversial.  Hrs-2 is a protein that has been localized on endosomes by
              light and electron microscopy and interacts with eps15, a protein required for
              endocytosis, suggesting that hrs-2 may play a role in endocytosis.  Although
              actin and hrs-2 do not directly interact, hrs-2 interacts with an actin binding
              protein, actinin-4.  The interaction of hrs-2 with actinin-4 suggests a
              mechanism by which endosomes interact with the actin cytoskeleton, and
              fragments of hrs-2 that block its association with actinin-4 inhibit
              endosome/actin association.  The experiments proposed will characterize the
              interaction of hrs-2 with actinin-4, and examine the role of hrs-2/ actinin-4
              interactions in endocytosis.  Biochemical, in situ and in vitro trafficking
              assays, will be used to test the notion that hrs-2 acts as a link between
              endosomes and actin via specific protein interactions with actinin-4, and to
              understand the role of this interaction in endocytic trafficking.
