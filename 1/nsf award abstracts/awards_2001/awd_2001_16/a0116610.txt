This is a proposal to acquire the instruments needed to couple
              a multi-purpose scanning probe microscope with a photon counting intensified
              CCD camera imaging system and a tunable liquid crystal filter to accomplish two
              objectives.  First, the instrumentation will create a multi-purpose test bed
              for the study of luminescence and spectral processes of reporter cells, nucleic
              acids, and enzymes at specialized substrata, thereby advancing fundamental
              understanding of biomicroelectronics and nanobiotechnology.  Second, the
              instrument will dramatically improve the infrastructure and expand the research
              and training efforts of the scientific and engineering communities at the
              University.  In addition, the instrumentation will be used in courses in
              Microbiology, Biochemistry, Electrical Engineering, and Geology.
