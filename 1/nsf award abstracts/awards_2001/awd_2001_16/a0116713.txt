Abstract    :
              This award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will enable the
              Chemistry Department at Willamette University to acquire laser light scattering
              instrumentation.  With these new capabilities, the PI will investigate the
              nature of intermolecular interactions in binary liquid mixtures by analyzing
              both Rayleigh and Raman scattering intensities as a function of composition and
              temperature.  In addition, in collaboration with Dr. Jeffrey Willemsen, he will
              study the antispermatogenic nature of gossypol derivatives.  Student
              researchers at this undergraduate institution will also participate in these
              projects.  

Liquid solutions and the solvation process are vital to both the
              scientific community and the chemical industry, but the liquid phase is a
              challenge to understand and model.  The close proximity of molecules in a
              liquid makes the influence of the intermolecular potential impossible to
              ignore, and the lack of long range order in a liquid further complicates
              matters.  Fortunately, motion and dynamics in a solution may be studied by
              directing a laser onto the liquid sample and measuring the intensity and
              frequency of the scattered light.  Static and dynamic light scattering
              techniques represent an indispensable tool for the in-situ characterization of
              complex liquid systems.
