Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Trinity University will acquire a
              chemisorption-physisorption surface area and pore size analyzer.  This
              equipment will be used to fully characterize new supported bimetallic
              catalysts.  In addition, student researchers at this predominantly
              undergraduate institution will be exposed to fundamental concepts of the
              rapidly growing fields of solid state and materials chemistry. 

The
              determination of surface areas, pore sizes and chemisorption properties of
              catalysts is critical in evaluating both in evaluating new preparative
              procedures and in understanding how synthetic schemes affect metal particle
              morphology.  The control over particle size and composition will allow the new
              catalysts to be used to understand how these fundamental factors impact
              activity and selectivity in oxidation reactions.
