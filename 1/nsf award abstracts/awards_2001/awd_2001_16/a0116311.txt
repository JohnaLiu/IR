This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation
              Program, funds the acquisition of a 2-G Enterprises 755R superconducting rock
              magnetometer system (SRM) for the paleomagnetic laboratory in the new Physics,
              Earth, and Environmental Science Center at Occidental College.  The SRM will
              replace an aging spinner fluxgate magnetometer and allow rapid measurement of
              the remanence of both strongly- and weakly-magnetized geological samples. It
              will primarily be used by the PIs and undergraduate research assistants for
              projects concerning the tectonics of western North America, the
              magnetostratigraphy of Pacific coast Cenozoic sections, and the behavior of the
              geomagnetic field during polarity transitions.  The Occidental College
              paleomagnetic laboratory will also be available for use by researchers and
              students from other institutions.  In particular, the PIs anticipate relieving
              some of the pressure on Dr. Joseph Kirschvink's heavily-used lab at the
              California Institute of Technology.
