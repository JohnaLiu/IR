Abstract    :
              This is a Major Research Instrumentation award to enable the design and
              construction of a new instrument for measuring the activity spectrum of cloud
              condensation nuclei (CCN).  The principle of operation is that air is drawn
              slowly and continuously through a thermal-gradient diffusion chamber in which
              the supersaturation increases with increasing distance into the chamber.  At
              the exit of the chamber, the cloud droplets that have formed are counted and
              sized with an optical particle counter.  A mathematical inversion procedure is
              then used to compute the CCN spectrum from the measured droplet spectrum,
              assuming a relationship between the size of a droplet and the critical
              supersaturation at which it formed.  The proposed instrument is an improvement
              over existing designs for two reasons: modern digital electronics will be used
              for particle detection and counting, and by use of concentric cylindrical walls
              the cloud chamber will be in the shape of an annulus instead of a simple
              rectangular channel.  The advantage of the annular shape is that undesirable
              edge effects associated with side walls are eliminated.  The information
              provided by the instrument is fundamental for cloud microphysics and also bears
              on the way aerosol particles and their radiative effects are treated in
              numerical climate models.
