This is a proposal to acquire equipment to be used in the
              development of a field instrument for the identification and quantitation of
              microorganisms in environmental samples.  The instrument involves nucleic acid
              hybridizations on the surface of microscopic, fluorescent, polystyrene beads in
              order to identify specific DNA sequences in heterogeneous mixtures of
              sequences.  Specific objectives include: (1) the development of hardware
              specifications for the instrument, (2) specification of the calibrations which
              must be conducted in order to make quantitatively accurate measurements of
              several microorganisms, and (3) develop the software and statistical analysis
              procedure for analyzing the data.
