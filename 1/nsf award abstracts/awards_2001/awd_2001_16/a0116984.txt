Abstract    :
              Optimal design, optimal control, and parameter estimation of systems governed by
              partial differen-tial
equations give rise to a class of problems known as
              PDE-constrained optimization. The size and
complexity of the discretized PDE
              constraints often pose significant challenges for contemporary
optimization
              methods. Recent advances in algorithms, software, and high performance
              computing
systems have resulted in PDE simulations that can often scale to
              millions of variables, thousands
of processors, and multiple physics
              interactions. As PDE solvers mature, there is increasing in-dustrial
and
              scientific interest in solving optimization problems governed by such
              large-scale PDE
simulations.
To address the challenges of these problems the
              investigators have organized a workshop on PDE-constrained
optimization on
              April 4-6,2001, in Santa Fe, NM. The goals of the workshop are to identify the
              needs
and opportunities for PDE-constrained optimization in industry and the
              national labs, to assess the state of the art in PDE-constrained optimization,
              to identify barriers to PDE-constrained optimization presented by
modern
              simulation codes, and to discuss promising algorithmic and software approaches
              for overcoming these barriers.
Sandia National Laboratories will sponsor the
              workshop itself. to expose a new generation of researchers to this rapidly
              growing area of research, the investigators will use this grant to support
              students attending
and participating in the workshop.
