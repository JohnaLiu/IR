Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for infrastructure for the design, readout, and
              testing of semiconductor sensors for use in high energy particle physics
              experiments.  The equipment requested includes a probe station, wire bonders,
              geometry gauge, logic analyzer, plasma cleaner, voltage sources, and
              positioning stages.  The equipment will allow the collaborating groups to
              broaden the range of their contributions to experiments in which they already
              have leadership roles (ATLAS, CLEO, CDF, and D0).  The main focus of this
              proposal is to use this equipment to develop and construct the ATLAS pixel
              detector.  ATLAS is a large international collaboration to which the US
              contributes over 20% of the effort, and which detector is currently under
              construction for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN Laboratory in
              Geneva Switzerland.  Many NSF-supported groups participate in ATLAS.  In
              addition, there is concurrent activity in the development of a silicon upgrade
              for the CDF detector for Run IIb at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider.  Many
              NSF-supported groups are collaborating on the CDF experiment.  The University
              of New Mexico proposes to lead the design and testing of the pixel sensors,
              which would be based on the ATLAS designs.  The opportunities presented for
              education by this project at the collaborating universities are also described.
