Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Mary Washington College will acquire a scanning
              probe microscope (SPM). This equipment will enhance research in a number of
              areas including a) the study of intermolecular interactions in physisorbed
              self-assemblies (structures and competitive depositions); b) in situ membrane
              construction studies; and c) in situ visualization of drug-DNA interactions.
              

The scanning probe microscope (SPM) enables researchers to image atoms
              directly. The technique uses the piezoelectric effect which involves bringing
              an extremely sharp metal needle within a few angstroms of the sample surface.
              The distance is small enough for electrons to leak or tunnel across the gap and
              generate a minute current. As the gap between the tip and the sample increases,
              the current decreases. As the probe crosses the sample, moving back and forth
              across its surface, it traces out a contour map of the sample's surface atoms.
              These studies will have impact in materials and medicinal chemistry.
