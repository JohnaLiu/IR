This award by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI)
              program provides 51% of the cost for the acquisition of a multi-collector
              thermal ionization mass spectrometer at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. The
              instrument will be equipped with ion counting and negative ion capabilities,
              and will have a second-stage energy filter for measurements requiring high
              abundance sensitivity. The instrument will be used for measurement of a variety
              of isotope systems, including Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, U-Th-Pb, Re-Os, Pt-Os, and U
              decay-series nuclides, with a wide range of geochemical and geochronological
              applications. Specific research areas that will be pursued with the instrument
              include: mantle enrichment processes at convergent boundaries; identification
              and dating of meteorite impact structures; sources of ocean island basalts;
              petrogenetic processes and timescales in active magmatic systems; isotopic
              dating of clay diagenesis;  isotopic studies of microbial processes and
              elemental cycling; petrogenesis of bimodal and heterogeneous magmatic systems;
              spatial and temporal evolution of basalt sources and processes in continental
              extensional settings; applications of tephrostratigraphy and tephrochemistry;
              single-crystal dating methods; and U-Pb dating of paleosol carbonates.
