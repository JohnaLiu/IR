This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation
              (MRI) Program, will provide funds for the purchase of an ICP-OES spectrometer
              for Mesa State College. Mesa State is a predominately undergraduate institution
              with a growing emphasis on undergraduate research and educational outreach. 
              The instrument will be used by the geology and environmental science programs,
              which are experiencing significant growth.  The faculty in these programs have
              a number of funded research projects involving undergraduate students. Specific
              projects that would utilize the ICP-OES include a study of manganese
              biogeochemistry in streams impacted by acid mine drainage, analyses of
              dissolved metals in soil pore waters to elucidate factors affecting soil
              mineral weathering in the high desert ecosystem of western Colorado, studies of
              non-point source pollution to the Colorado River, and a study of the sources
              and fate of Selenium in shallow groundwaters of the Grand Valley of western
              Colorado.  Acquisition of this instrument will provide support for this
              research. The ICP will complement other major instrumentation at Mesa State and
              will fill a need for modern atomic spectroscopy.  Mesa State College provides
              higher education for a large portion of western Colorado and eastern Utah. 
              Educational outreach programs to K-12 teachers and students are becoming
              increasingly important.  There are a number of collaborative programs underway
              and more are planned.  The ICP spectrometer will be used to provide access to
              modern atomic spectroscopy to the participants in these outreach
              collaborations.
