Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Eastern Oregon State College will acquire an
              ion-trap gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection. This equipment
              will enhance research in a number of areas including a) development of
              analytical techniques to determine changes in fatty acid composition in fish
              during smolting; b) determination of the effects due to heat and light exposure
              on sex pheromones used by the US Forest Service; c) weed ecology, especially
              allelopathy; and d) isolation and structural eludication of biologically active
              naturally occurring compounds from plant and invertebrate sources.  This
              equipment will also be used in advanced undergraduate courses.  

Gas
              chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS) is an extremely
              powerful technique used for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures. 
              This instrument will substantially strengthen scientific research within the
              multidisciplinary program at Eastern Oregon State College and will have a
              significant impact in biochemistry and environmental chemistry.
