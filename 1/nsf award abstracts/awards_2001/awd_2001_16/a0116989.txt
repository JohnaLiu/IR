SGER: Biocomplexity: The limits to ecological
              understanding

A theory of ecological complexity must take into account
              limitations on predictability, observability, controllability, and even
              knowability as well as the critical role that humans play in influencing
              ecosystem dynamics at multiple spatial and temporal scales.  This project will
              involve an examination of the applicability of Kolmogorov complexity theory to
              ecological complexity in the categories of structural, embedded, and dynamic
              complexity.  Various nonlinear mathematical and physical systems will be
              examined including networks, chaos, cellular automata, and artificial life. 
              The goals of the project are to: 1) identify the central questions that relate
              ecological complexity to predictability, controllability, and knowability; 2)
              develop a definition of complexity for ecosystems; 3) develop a methodology for
              estimating how complex a given ecological system is; and 4) organize current
              knowledge of complexity, and develop the elements of a coherent theory of
              ecological complexity.  The PI also plans to organize a symposium for a
              national meeting to stimulate thinking about complexity.
