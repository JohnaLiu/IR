Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to extend existing knowledge in the field of
              network traffic modeling in two ways.  One objective is to develop
              approximation and bounding techniques that will provide first-order estimates
              of the performance of deterministic servers under arrival process having
              long-range dependence.  This effort will build upon both our previous work in
              developing approximate solutions for closed queuing networks having
              analytically intractable service distributions and the more recent work of
              Norros which characterized the behavior of a system having a self-similar
              arrival process and a constant service rate.
