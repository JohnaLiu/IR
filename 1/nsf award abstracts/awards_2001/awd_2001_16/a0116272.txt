Abstract    :
              This is a Major Research Instrumentation award that supports the development of
              a portable, three-wavelength scanning radar designed for meteorological
              research.  Called the Advanced Multi-Frequency Radar (AMFR), it consists of a
              single antenna capable of transmitting and receiving frequencies in the Ku-band
              (13 GHZ), Ka-band (33 GHz), and W-band (95 GHz).  (These frequencies correspond
              respectively to wavelengths of 2.2, 0.91, and 0.32 cm.)  Each of the three
              radar systems will be capable of both Doppler and polarization measurements. 
              The PI has already developed a dual-wavelength radar called the Cloud Profiling
              Radar System (CPRS), which operates at 0.9 and 0.3 cm.  This award enables the
              addition of the third radar having 2.2 cm wavelength, the construction of a new
              antenna, and improvement of the sensitivity of the existing systems at 0.9 and
              0.3 cm.  A unique feature of the radar is a system of feeds designed to insure
              that the single antenna produces collocated, matched beams for the three
              wavelengths.  Measurements at all wavelengths will thus be from the same volume
              of cloud.  The AMFR will be highly portable and relatively inexpensive to
              deploy.  Applications will be primarily to cloud microphysics.  Initial
              emphasis will be on layer clouds and precipitation processes in winter storms. 
              The radar will be able to detect some precipitation-free clouds, at least at
              the shorter wavelengths.  Moreover, rain and snow, when present, give different
              signals at the three receivers because the polarization characteristics of
              precipitation and the deviations from Rayleigh scattering both depend on
              wavelength.  These signals can be employed in various ways to distinguish rain
              from snow and to give information on the shape of ice-phase precipitation
              particles, the drop-size distribution in rain, and the variation of these
              quantities with height and time.  Measurements of this kind will give new
              insight on the formation and evolution of precipitation, contributing
              fundamentally to cloud physics and providing information needed to improve the
              treatment of precipitation in mesoscale and climate models.
