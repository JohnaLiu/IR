Abstract    :
              The proposal initiates a partnership to support an LSAMP Phase I alliance of
              seven institutions to address the problem of underrepresentation of
              African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans in technological education
              and enterprises. The partnership institutions are Elizabeth City State
              University, Fisk University, James Madison University, Johnson C. Smith
              University, St. Augustine's College, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
              State University. The goal of the alliance is to double the current number of
              SMET degrees earned by underrepresented minorities (371) in five years. To
              achieve this the alliance will incorporate regionally focused orientation
              programs for first-year students, oversee program management and technical
              assistance aggressively, and measure progress toward the outcomes through
              internal and external evaluation. Skill development activities including
              undergraduate research experiences and mentor guidance will be provided for
              LSAMP participants, and enrichment activities will be provided to improve the
              analytical skills of K-12 students. The program will also pursue goals for
              graduate school matriculation by LSAMP graduates.
