Abstract    :
              This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program will allow the
              University of Arkansas to acquire an atomic probe microscope (AFM). The
              instrument will enhance research capability at the institution. It will be used
              in research (1)on charging effects on surfaces of individual powder particles
              and nanoaerosols, (2) in biological specimen analysis, and (3) in surface
              characterization of thin films. The management plan will allow efficient use of
              the instrument by  faculty and students from several departments at the
              University of Arkansas. This is an important addition to the infrastructure at
              the institution.
