MRI: 
              Creation of the AVIDD Data Facility:  a Distributed Facility for Managing,
              Analyzing, and Visualizing Instrument-Driven Data  

This is a proposal for
              equipment acquisition under the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program to
              support research and student training across a broad range of instrument-driven
              data-intensive science areas.  The proposed distributed facility for managing,
              analyzing, and visualizing instrument-driven data would address the data life
              cycle consisting of data capture and remote data reduction;  high speed data
              transfer;  real time data analysis and processing;  data storage;  data
              retreival;  data analysis and postprocessing;  data visualization;  and the use
              of remote data stores.  Among the research projects enhanced and enabled by the
              proposed facility are both computer science and applications area projects, for
              example work on end-to-end real time data management for remote control and use
              of beam-line systems by X-ray crystallographers
