              ABSTRACT
OPP-0116325

This dissertation project examines the effects of
              volcanism and other paleoenvironmental factors on the movement, boundary
              behavior, and settlement pattern and chronology of Late Holocene human
              populations on the Alaska Peninsula.  Geologic sections on the Alaska Peninsula
              will be sampled and analyzed for both paleoenvironmental reconstruction and
              comparison of compositions of historic and prehistoric pyroclastic flows.  A
              4.5m geologic profile on the Pacific coast of the Aniakchak National Monument
              and Preserve will be sampled for pollen, microfossils, and other organics to
              reconstruct how Holocene vegetation reacted to both periodic and catastrophic
              volcanism.  One focus here will be on the rate at which vegetation recolonized
              the 3400 B.P. Aniakchak pyroclastic flow, allowing the eventual cultural
              reoccupation of the region.  Pollen and other samples will be taken at least
              every 5cm through much of the 4.5m profile, with sampling every centimeter
              after major volcanic events.  Samples will be recovered from the 3400 B.P.
              Aniakchak pyroclastic flow and from the Katmai pyroclastic flow in the Valley
              of Ten Thousand Smokes.  Comparison of variables between these two flows will
              determine the utility of using the Katmai PF as a historic revegetation analog
              for the Aniakchak flow.  Surface testing and both surface and subsurface
              samples will be taken from the pyroclastic flow exposures, with samples
              compared for percent of silica, abrasiveness, and other variables. The research
              will contribute to the understanding of volcanism's effects on human
              paleogeography in other northern and maritime regions of the globe.
