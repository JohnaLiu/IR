MRI:  Acquisition of a
              Power4-based IBM SP and PC-based Scalable Display Wall for Multidisciplinary
              Computational Science Research

This is a proposal for equipment acquisition
              under the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program to support research and
              student training across a broad range of advanced scientific computing
              applications.  The proposed supercomputer and visualization instrumentation
              would contribute to computational investigations of subnuclear particle
              phenomena, the dynamics of quantum systems, space weather modeling, the
              electrodynamics of plasma processes in the ionosphere, managing the
              manufacturing supply chain, subsurface sensing and imaging systems, among many
              other projects.
