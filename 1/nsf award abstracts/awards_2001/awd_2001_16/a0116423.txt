Abstract    :
              This MRI Proposal involves the procurement of an Ultra-High Resolution Electron
              Beam (E-Beam) Nanolithography and Metrology System for research and education
              programs at Lehigh University. The E-Beam system offers a unique capability to
              university, industry and government researchers to fabricate novel device
              structures and to characterize the nanometric features of materials. This E-B
              earn system will provide an opportunity for researchers to realize
              nanolithographic features for the fabrication of mesoscopic and quantum
              devices, such as quantum-dot nonvolatile semiconductor memories, single
              electron transistors, biosensors, and nanoscopic-instrumented,
              microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). In addition, the E-Beam system will
              provide exceptional educational instruction into nanotechnology. The
              fabrication of devices requires the integration of processes where literally
              several hundred operations are needed to realize a final device structure. In
              order to accomplish this seamless integration of processes an E-Beam
              Nanolithograpy and Metrology System must be located literally within the same
              physical infrastructure. For example, the close coupling of nanoelectronics
              devices and MEMS with the preparation of biological samples is essential to
              accomplish tasks such as cell characterization and electronic sequencing of
              DNA. Finally, the E-Beam system will serve the surrounding community within the
              Lehigh Valley particularly the local colleges and K-12 students to excite
              students into the emerging world of nanotechnology.
