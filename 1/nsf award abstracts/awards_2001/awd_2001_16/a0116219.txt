Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Hobart and William Smith Colleges will acquire a gel
              permeation chromatography/size exclusion chromatography (GPC/SEC) instrument
              for polymer characterization.  This equipment will enhance research in a number
              of areas including a) the molecular design of organometallic oligomers and
              polymers; b) the synthesis, characterization and evaluation of new copolymers
              as transacylation catalysts; and c) the influence of allosteric ligands and
              aggregation state on the activity of skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase I. 
              

Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is an extremely powerful technique used
              for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures, in which components are
              separated based on their size.  This instrument will substantially strengthen
              scientific research at this primarily undergraduate institution and will allow
              for the incorporation of polymer and material sciences into the research and
              teaching programs.
