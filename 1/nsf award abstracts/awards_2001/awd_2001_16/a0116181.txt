Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Detroit-Mercy 
              will acquire a liquid chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection. This
              versatile system includes a photodiode array detector and a quadrupole mass
              spectrometry detector with atmospheric pressure electrospray and chemical
              ionization sources.  This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including characterization of verdazyl free radicals, isoflavones and their
              metabolites and modified peptides.  

Liquid chromatography with mass
              spectrometric detection (LCMS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the
              separation and analysis of complex mixtures.  This instrument will
              substantially strengthen scientific research at this primarily undergraduate
              institution.  The LCMS will also be used in advanced courses.
