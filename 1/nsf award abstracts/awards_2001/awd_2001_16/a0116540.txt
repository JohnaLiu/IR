Abstract    :
              This is a Major Research Instrumentation award to acquire equipment to upgrade
              the West Virginia University Plasma Physics Laboratory's new Space Physics
              Simulation Facility.  The facility consists of a cylindrical, stainless-steel
              vacuum chamber 4 meters long and 1.8 meters in diameter.  The objective of the
              upgrade is to acquire equipment necessary to launch a unique category of
              experiments within the subfield of dusty plasmas, a subfield with wide-ranging
              scientific and technological applications.  The new experiments enabled will
              provide information about the electrostatic dust-cyclotron instability and
              other new waves and instabilities associated with dusty plasmas having the
              dust-grain gyroradius much smaller than the radius of the plasma, a parameter
              regime yet to be achieved in the laboratory.  The experiments will provide
              access to a parameter regime that has commanded significant recent theoretical
              attention.  The equipment includes electromagnets, vacuum pumps, power supply,
              and 16-channel waveform recorder.  The long range goal is for the Space Physics
              Simulation Facility to assume scientific leadership in experimental studies of
              magnetized dusty plasmas.
