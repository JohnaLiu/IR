This award to University of Washington will provide support for
              the design and prototype of a 100 kW parallel DC power system for cabled,
              undersea observatories for oceanographic research.  The design is intended to
              support a "plate-scale" system such as the NEPTUNE network of remote,
              interactive natural laboratories that is being planned for the seafloor region
              called the Juan de Fuca Plate, offshore of the Pacific Northwest.  NEPTUNE is
              being designed to include thirty or more discrete observatory nodes, each
              capable of hosting multiple observing systems, along a system involving 3000
              kilometers or more of fiber optic cable for power and communications.  The
              power system addressed here will be designed in parallel with communications
              systems presently under development at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
              Institution, with coordination provided by the NEPTUNE System Engineering Team.
               Wet testing is anticipated to take place in two submarine installations, one
              in California and one in Canada, in Spring 2004.
