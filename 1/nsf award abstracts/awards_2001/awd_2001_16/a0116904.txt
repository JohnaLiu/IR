This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation
              (MRI) Program, provides partial support to upgrade an existing ARL-SEMQ
              electron microprobe (EMP) in the Geology Department at the University of
              Hawaii-Hilo.  This EMP was recently donated to the Department by the USGS and
              has since been upgraded with modern PC-based control and data acquisition
              systems.  This support will replace the electron gun power supply (now 20 years
              old), the back-scatter imaging system, and the optical mirrors within the
              microprobe.  In addition, as teaching and education are an important mission of
              this laboratory, funds will be used to develop a remote operating capability.
              This will allow demonstrations of EMP techniques for use in current courses,
              workshops and to produce outreach programs for local high schools.  Additional
              funds will be used for the purchase of a carbon coater and an optical
              microscope and image analysis system.  Having an operational and modern
              electron microscopy facility at UH-Hilo will greatly enhance their ability to
              attract and retain students in the sciences. In particular, Hawaiian and
              Pacific Islander students make up a large proportion of the student body. 
              Researchers at the nearby USGS Hawaiian Volcanological Observatory (HVO) will
              also have access to the probe for initial quantitative chemical and textural
              analysis of basaltic lavas.
