Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Lycoming College  will acquire a glove box,
              Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and an ultraviolet-visible
              (UV-VIS) spectrophotometer.  Research will focus on the following studies: a)
              synthetic chemistry utilizing intramolecular hydroacylation; b) production of
              mixed metal selenides; and c) the production of carbon-based radicals. 
              Students at this undergraduate institution will be heavily involved in these
              research projects.  

A glove box is a critical piece of equipment when
              handling air-sensitive chemicals.  FTIR and UV-VIS spectrometers are mainstays
              of the modern chemical laboratory, allowing rapid identification of unknown
              compounds.  These fundamental studies will have an impact in a variety of areas
              including synthetic inorganic and organic chemistry.
