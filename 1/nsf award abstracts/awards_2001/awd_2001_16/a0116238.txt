ABSTRACT

A major
              concern with weldments is to establish and quantify the role played by residual
              stress and material inhomogeneity in the fracture process.  The researcher will
              investigate the mechanics of weldments in both the fabrication process and the
              potential fracture events in service. The theoretical work will include (a) the
              development of fundamental fracture mechanics parameters or advanced procedures
              that can characterize the fracture of solids containing residual stress and
              material inhomogeneity and (b) the numerical modeling of the entire process of
              welding, fabrication of fracture testing samples, and fracture mechanics
              testing.   The modeling work will be integrated, refined and validated with
              experimental and metallurgical studies at DOE laboratories.
