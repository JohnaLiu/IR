Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at New York University will acquire a 400 MHz nuclear
              magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer and upgrade the console of an existing
              500 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out
              studies on a) metal/ligand conformational dynamics and the mechanism of
              inversion of an element of helical chirality upon oxidation/reduction in a
              coordination complex; b) the preparation of libraries of vitamin B12
              derivatives; c) the characterization of biologically active and theoretically
              interesting fullerene adducts; and d) the impact of stereochemistry and DNA
              base sequence on the conformational mobility of chemical adducts derived from
              the binding of stereoisomeric benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxides to N2-guanine. 
              

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
              available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
              used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from
              these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas including materials
              chemistry and medicinal chemistry, among others.
