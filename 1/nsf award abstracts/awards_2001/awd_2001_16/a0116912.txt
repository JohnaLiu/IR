Abstract    :
              0116912  Oerther  The objective of this research is to develop culture-based
              Biomedical Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (BioMEMS) chips to identify,
              enumerate, and characterize microorganisms in environmental samples.  The
              specific objectives of this research are: (1) developing fundamental science to
              establish the novel concept of scaled-down, culture-based identification and
              quantification of Gram positive, mycolic acid containing Actinomycetes (e. g.
              mycobacteria and nocardioforms), and (2) demonstrating scaled-down, microbial
              culturing using a proof-of-concept BioMEMS chip device.  This research could
              eventually lead to a rapid, cost-efficient technology for microbial monitoring
              of environmental samples.  ***
