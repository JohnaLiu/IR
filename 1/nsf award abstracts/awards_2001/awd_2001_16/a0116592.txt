Abstract    :
              This CONACyT proposal (the other co-PI is from Mexico) has been ranked high
              among the proposals reviewed at the Robotics  panel. It received three written
              reviews, with ratings (E, V, G).  This collaborative effort builds on the
              theoretical  background of one co-PI and  the experimental experience of the
              other. The work focuses on development of mobile robotic systems capable of 
              performing sophisticated visibility-based tasks with minimal sensing
              requirements. The goal is to construct algorithms and control laws that use
              information directly from the robot sensors, such that the task at hand would
              be carried out without the need for elaborate measurements that are usually
              required.
