Abstract

Funding is requested for the development of a
              non-contacting ignition system for polymer combustion studies. The system will
              consist of a high-power lamp and associated optics, a pyrometry system for
              measuring surface temperature, and a heat flux sensor to monitor the uniformity
              of the heating system.  A supporting numerical model will also be developed to
              validate the system.  The ignitability of plastics as determined by this system
              should be extendable to other geometry, energy input and oxygen level through a
              suitable analysis.
