Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Environmental and Chemical Sciences at Chapman College will
              acquire a gas chromatograph ion trap tandem mass spectrometer (GCMS). This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including a) studies of
              emission rates and mechanisms of stratospheric ozone-depleting halogenated
              compounds from wetland plants; b) the photochemical reactions of polyaromatic
              hydrocarbon (PAH) pollutants in surface waters; and c) a collaborative study
              using chemical tracers as indicators for anthropogenic sewage inputs to
              watershed run-off.  Faculty will conduct a joint ongoing study of non-point
              pollution sources in a local salt marsh.  This study will be integrated into
              four laboratory courses for research training in GCMS techniques through
              student group projects.  

Gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric
              detection (GCMS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation and
              analysis of complex mixtures.  This instrument will substantially strengthen
              scientific research in Environmental Sciences at Chapman University.
