Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Grinnell College will acquire an electrochemical
              impedance instrument and a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The
              electrochemical impedance instrument will enable the principal investigator and
              undergraduates at Grinnell to carry out ionic conductivity studies of polymeric
              electrolytes; the DSC will facilitate the measurement of the thermal properties
              of the electrolytes.  

Differential Scanning Calorimetry is an extremely
              useful tool in modern analytical chemistry.  Calorimetric analysis is used to
              measure the thermal energy (heat) exchange that occurs during molecular
              interactions and reactions.  Thus DSC  provides a very reliable and sensitive
              method for determining thermodynamic properties of materials such as changes in
              heat capacity of liquid and solid samples.  Impedance spectroscopy measures the
              alternating current resistance, i.e., the impedance, of a sample as a function
              of frequency.  Knowledge of thermodynamic properties and impedances is crucial
              to understanding the behavior of materials, such as polymer electrolytes, that
              show promise in microelectronics and lightweight, small batteries.
