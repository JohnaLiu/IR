  The ongoing eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano (SHV)
              on Montserrat provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate complex
              magmatic processes at an andesitic volcano.  Growth of the lava dome has been
              unsteady and accompanied by cyclic patterns of ground deformation, seismicity,
              and explosive eruptions.  The cycles include a short-term scale (6-18 hour), a
              meso-term scale (~7 weeks), and a long-term scale (~30 y).  They provide
              insights into eruption dynamics at andesite volcanoes, with the short-term
              cycles suggesting that degassing, rheological stiffening of the magma, and
              pressurization in the upper conduits are coupled and control many of the
              geophysical and dynamical phenomena observed.  The meso- and long- term cycles
              may reflect deep-seated processes involving the magma reservoir.  This project
              will investigate the dynamics of the full system using an integrated array of
              specialized instruments in four strategically located 200-m boreholes, and
              several shallower holes, surrounding SHV.  The system is active and dynamic and
              will remain so for the foreseeable future.  Analysis of the continuous
              perishable data provided by these instruments should provide important new
              insights and specific constraints to theoretical models, involving the dynamic
              behavior of the andesite magmatic system.

This is a collaborative project
              involving P.I.s from Penn State University, Carnegie Institution of Washinton,
              University of Arkansas, in collaboration with Montserrat Volcano Obervatory
              (MVO) and scientists from Bristol and Leeds Universities in the UK.  The UK
              investigators have been funded to share drilling costs and to support UK
              scientific analyses.  The expertise, facilities, and database of MVO also
              provide cost-share contributions.
