A model has been developed, which separates baroclinic
              and barotropic contributions to tide gauge records.  Cusps are generally agreed
              to be due to internal tides.  The model assumes phase-modulated internal waves
              that arrive at the gauge as evanescent waves.  Phase modulation results from
              variable phase speed due to variable thermocline characteristics caused by
              processes such as Rossby waves.  More rapid modulation results in more cusping
              and zero modulation results in the internal wave being misinterpreted as the
              barotropic tide.  The PIs propose a complete analysis of the 108-year long
              Honolulu record, analysis of other long records from Hawaii (there are 4 such
              records on the north shore that seem to be interpretable assuming a single
              internal tidal wave so that phase can be estimated and other processes
              investigated), and analysis of other long records from non-island sites, e.g.
              San Francisco.
