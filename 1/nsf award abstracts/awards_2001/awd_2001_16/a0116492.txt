Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Richmond will acquire a high field
              (500 MHz) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer for undergraduate
              research. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a)
              characterization of relatively small molecules prepared in organic, inorganic,
              and organometallic synthetic studies; and b) structure elucidation of small- to
              medium-sized biomolecules in biochemical studies.   The NMR will also be used
              on a limited basis in upper level laboratory courses.  

Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists
              for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify
              unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
              solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
              studies will have an impact in a number of areas including biochemistry and
              synthethic chemistry.
