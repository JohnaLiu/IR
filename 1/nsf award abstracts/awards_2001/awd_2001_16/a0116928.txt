This Americas Program award will support Dr. Pedro J.
              Alvarez of the University of Iowa and Dr. Susan E. Powers of Clarkson
              University, in collaboration with Dr. Henry X. Corseuil of the Universidade
              Federal de Santa Catarina, Brazil. The aim of the project is to form an
              international research coordination group to provide a forum for timely
              communication among environmental scientists and engineers studying how the
              increased use of ethanol in gasoline might affect the fate and transport of
              petroleum product spills and related risk assessment and remediation
              activities.  The group would (1) identify pertinent knowledge gaps,
              uncertainties, and research needs; and (2) coordinate research activities to
              avoid duplicative efforts and facilitate the sharing of the data. 

Brazil
              has over 20 years of experience in dealing with ethanol in gasoline. 
              Communication among researchers will advance our basic understanding of the
              transport and fate of ethanol and fuel hydrocarbons in the presence of ethanol,
              and contribute to the development of new tools for environmental and risk
              assessment.
