Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Hope College will acquire an Inductively Coupled
              Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES).  The research programs that
              will benefit from the purchase of this instrument are centered on
              biogeochemical studies of the local Lake Macatawa watershed, specifically the
              fate and transport of metals within the watershed.  This instrument will also
              be used to train undergraduate students in state-of-the-art analytical methods
              commonly employed in chemistry, geology and environmental
              science.

Electrically generated plasmas produce energetic sources for the
              optical emission spectrometer.  An inductively coupled plasma is a
              high-temperature source in which energy to form the plasma is generated by a
              high-frequency magnetic field.  The optical emission spectrometer is an
              extremely useful analytical tool that allows the identification of molecular
              species and an understanding of the energy levels in the molecule.  These
              studies will have a significant impact in furthering our understanding of
              environmental chemistry of watersheds.
