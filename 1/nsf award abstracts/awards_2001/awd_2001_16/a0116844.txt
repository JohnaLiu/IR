This award to San Jose State University will provide support for
              acquisition of a high resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer
              for research in biological, chemical and geological oceanography and related
              fields at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. It will serve a broad and
              diverse population of researchers, faculty and students from the California
              State University system and other researchers in the Monterey, California
              vicinity.  San Jose State University, a non-Ph.D.-granting university, will
              contribute about 23% of the cost of this project from non-federal funds.
