Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, a consortium
              of universities in the northeastern United States will acquire a suite of
              high-end computers.  Faculty members from Hamilton, Colgate, Vassar, Holy
              Cross, St. Lawrence, Connecticut, and Hobart and William Smith Colleges will
              share the equipment to carry out research in environmental sciences,
              biochemistry, materials chemistry, and bioinorganic chemistry.  The consortium
              will purchse two workstations for each institution and a 32 processor
              supercomputer will be located at Hamilton College.   This equipment will enable
              new teaching laboratories in the physical chemistry courses at these
              institutions and will provide hands-on training for student researchers at
              these primarily undergraduate institutions.  

A cluster of fast, modern
              computer workstations is vital to serving the computing needs of active
              research departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a development
              environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides cutting-edge
              graphics and visualization facilities, and supports research in
              state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing.  These studies will have
              a significant impact in a number of areas, including biochemistry and materials
              sciences.
