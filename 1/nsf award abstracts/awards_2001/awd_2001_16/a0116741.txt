ABSTRACT

	A grant has been awarded to Dr. Lisa Hibbard at
              Spelman College to fund the acquisition of a circular dichroism (CD)
              spectropolarimeter to be used for the following purposes: (1) The PIs current
              project involves a study of the structure and function of the eye lens protein
              a-crystallin using spectroscopy techniques. (2) The Chemistry Department will
              perform protein structure determination experiments in the teaching
              biochemistry laboratory course. (3) It will be used in a spectroscopy
              laboratory-based course that is proposed as a bridging course between the
              departments of Chemistry and Physics at the College. (4) There will be
              occasional use by researchers at Clark-Atlanta University who are collaborators
              with faculty at Spelman College.
	 
	 The research project is of significance
              as there is still a great deal to be learned regarding the relationship between
              a-crystallin structure and chaperone function.  Little information is currently
              available on the tertiary structure of the protein and no one has studied the
              effects of the presence of salt in conjunction with exposure to UV radiation on
              structure and function.  In addition, as Spelman College prides itself on
              producing excellent African-American women scientists, these projects will
              serve as a training ground for undergraduate students to perform biochemical
              research.  The CD instrument will also be available for use in teaching lab
              experiments in the Chemistry and Physics Departments at Spelman and by other
              researchers in the Atlanta area. Students from underrepresented groups will be
              exposed to new technologies through courses, laboratories, and research
              projects utilizing this new instrument.
