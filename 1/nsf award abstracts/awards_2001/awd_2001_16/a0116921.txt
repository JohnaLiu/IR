The aim of this project is to study the role of
              mixing and vorticity 
generated by breaking waves on the formation and
              evolution of Langmuir 
circulations in the oceanic surface mixed layer.   A
              theoretical model, 
consistent with data from recent field experiments, will
              be developed.  
This model will extend GLM theory from the weak-wave regime to
              a regime 
in which the surface waves have a more realistic steepness and will
              
include a representation of vorticity injection by breaking waves.  The
              
dynamics of the model will be explored with numerical methods.  The
              
anticipated outcome is a better model of the development and structure 
of
              Langmuir-cell scale vortical motions in the ocean mixed layer.   If
              
successful, this may be useful in the development of better mixed-layer
              
representations in large-scale ocean and climate models.
