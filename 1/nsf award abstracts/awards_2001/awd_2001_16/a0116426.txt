Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program Youngstown State
              University will acquire a powder X-ray Diffractometer system to support the
              research needs of faculty, master's level students, and undergraduate students
              at the institution. The instrument will also support research and training of
              faculty and students at other colleges that are part a consortium of users
              affiliated with single crystal X-ray facility at Youngstown State University.
              The X-ray Diffractometer will provide data of sufficiently high quality to
              enable structure determinations of powder samples, which is not possible with
              multi-wire detector currently used for powder analysis. The instrument will be
              available on hands-on basis to students in upper level laboratory courses and
              thus will positively education and training at the institutions.
