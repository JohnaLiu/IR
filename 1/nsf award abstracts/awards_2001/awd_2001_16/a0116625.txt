Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigators will acquire dedicated instrumentation for
              computational research in structural biology, material science, and
              environmental/marine sciences. The investigators also lead the undergraduate &
              graduate computational science curricula at UNC-Chapel Hill, which will benefit
              from the proposed instrumentation. The proposed equipment includes clusters of
              linux workstations, two 16-processor beowulf-class machines for parallel
              programming development and education, and a next generation mid-sized shared
              memory machine|a 48 processor SGI Origin 3000. These three components will be
              integrated using campus optical fiber, and shared file and processing systems,
              with consistent configuration and portability across the six departments
              (Chemistry, Computer Science, Environmental Sciences and Engineering, Marine
              Science, Mathematics, Statistics) and the Institute for Marine Sciences (IMS).
              High-end production work will continue to be accomplished at the nearby North
              Carolina Supercomputing Center, which include a tera op IBM SP system with 180
              nodes and 720 processors. The proposed instrumentation, along with the NCSC
              facility, will yield a high-performance computational environment for the
              interdisciplinary computational science research and education program at
              UNC-CH.
