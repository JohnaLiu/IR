Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Lake Superior State University will acquire an
              Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer. This equipment will be used for
              research on environmental issues of the Upper Great Lakes region; as a tool for
              undergraduates working on environmental research projects as part of their
              senior thesis; to introduce modern mass spectrophotometric techniques to the
              undergraduate curriculum; and to support faculty and community partnering on
              environmental projects.  Specific projects include establishment of a long-term
              monitoring program for trace metals in the Lake Superior Watershed, including
              an emphasis on changes in isotopic ratios for key elements such as lead; and
              the analysis of sediments and biota for trace metals in the St. Marys River
              Area of Concern.

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe
              intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast
              array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The results from
              these studies will have an impact in the area of environmental chemistry and
              public health.
