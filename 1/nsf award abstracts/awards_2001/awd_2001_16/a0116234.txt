This Major Research Instrumentation award to Old Dominion
              University will provide support for acquisition of a stable isotope ratio mass
              spectrometer and related instrumentation for researchers in three departments. 
              It is expected that the new instrumentation and the interdepartmental research
              and training that it offers will foster inter- and multi-disciplinary
              approaches to a broad range of problems in marine chemistry, biology and
              related environmental sciences.  Old Dominion University will contribute
              cost-sharing of more than 47% of the cost of this project from non-federal
              funds.
