This award supports a  Major Research Instrumentation (MRI)
              Program project for one year of funding to develop a state-of-the-art
              continuous flow analysis (CFA) system that will be used for measuring
              concentrations of eight soluble chemical species (calcium, hydrogen peroxide,
              ammonium, formaldehyde, nitrate, sodium, chloride and sulfate) plus electrical
              conductivity in polar ice cores.  The system will be designed for use in either
              the laboratory or the field and will consist of a melter (to hold, feed, melt
              and monitor the core melting progress) and a liquid-flow system to distribute
              melted samples and mix with reagents.  In addition, the system will have a
              detector to measure the various analytical streams and a data acquisition and
              processing system for manipulating the large amounts of data that will be
              produced.  While the chemical principles used in the detectors are well
              established, the design of the overall system and the detailed instrumentation
              will be entirely new.  This new instrument will enable U.S. ice core scientists
              to remain at the forefront of technology and will increase the quality and rate
              at which new ice core records can be produced.  The access to new ice core
              records which will be produced by this instrument should result in a better
              understanding of climate and atmospheric chemistry.
