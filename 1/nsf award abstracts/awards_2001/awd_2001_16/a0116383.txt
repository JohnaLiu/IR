Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Maryland in College Park will
              acquire an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. This equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas: a) nanostructure reactivity and registration at
              solid surfaces; b) derivatization of metal and metal oxide surfaces via
              molecular and mesoscopic self assembly; c) chemical vapor deposition of metal
              oxides; d) combinatorial synthesis of functional oxides; and e) soft chemical
              routes to novel solid state materials.  

The X-ray photoelectron
              spectrometer (XPS)  is used for chemical analysis.  It irradiates a sample with
              a beam of monochromatic X-rays and the energies of the resulting photoelectrons
              are measured and related to specific elements.  XPS often plays a crucial role
              in defining the system under study.  The work to be carried out by these
              investigators represents a highly coherent attack on a range of issues at the
              forefront of materials chemistry.
