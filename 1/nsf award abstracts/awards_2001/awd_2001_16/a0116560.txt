Abstract    :
              This project ((in collaboration with Dr. Ricardo Oropeza, ITSEM CEM, Mexico)
              will investigate the problem of sensor-based exploration of unknown
              environments by autonomous robots. The work will include autonomous
              construction of a representation of the environment (the mapping problem),
              annotating the map with landmarks for robot localization, and the use of the
              constructed map for navigation.
