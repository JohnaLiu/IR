Abstract    :
              This award will allow the Department of Physics at New York University
to set
              up a cluster of advanced workstations (48 nodes of dual 866 MHz
Pentium III
              processors) to support computationally intensive research
in a number of areas
              of theoretical physics and astrophysics.  The
proposed research projects
              include:
1) properties of atmospheric particle showers induced by
              ultra-high-energy
cosmic rays [Farrar];
2) simulation of astrophysical
              magnetic fields [Farrar in collaboration with
Goodman and others];
3)
              magnetically controlled electrical transport in layered structures [Levy];
4)
              statistical mechanics of simple and complex fluids [Percus];
5) structure
              formation in the early universe [Scoccimarro and Zaldarriaga];
6) asymptotic
              freedom in two-dimensional $\sigma$-models, and the critical
behavior of Potts
              antiferromagnets and of self-avoiding random walk
[Sokal];and 
7) confinement
              mechanisms in lattice quantum chromodynamics [Zwanziger].


The proposed
              research making use of this cluster will also provide
training in
              high-performance scientific computing for the Department's
graduate and
              undergraduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and visiting
faculty from other
              institutions, using a variety of programming languages
(Fortran, C, C++,
              Mathematica) and advanced scientific software. This
training in advanced
              computational techniques will be of benefit by
providing broadly applicable
              skills, not only to those graduate students
who pursue subsequent careers in
              academic research, but also to those who
go on to careers in industrial R+D
              and elsewhere in society.
