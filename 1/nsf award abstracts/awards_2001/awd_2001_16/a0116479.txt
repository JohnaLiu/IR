Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Sacred Heart University will acquire a two-channel,
              pulsed-field gradient 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Spectrometer.
              This equipment will enable researchers to carry out a numbers of studies
              including a) the conformation, orientation and location of biologically active
              lipoidal/amphiphilic compounds in liposomal membranes; b) protein-RNA
              interactions; c) structure elucidation of natural products; d) synthesis of
              self-assembling multi-metallic systems; e) synthesis of potential anti-hypoxia
              agents; and f) microwave applications in organic synthesis.   

Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
              identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms
              within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules
              in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
              studies will have an impact in a number of areas including biochemistry.
