Abstract    :
              This award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) will enable the
              Department of Chemistry at Pacific University to acquire an atomic force
              microscope/scanning tunneling microscope (AFM/STM) to enhance undergraduate
              research opportunities in electrochemistry and biochemistry. This equipment 
              will enhance research in two major projects:  a) the structural effects and
              consequences of electrochemical processes at commercially important lithium-ion
              cell graphite anodes will be studied in situ; and b) the study of aggregation
              phenomena on cell surfaces in aqueous environments. 

The scanning tunneling
              microscope (STM) enables researchers to image atoms directly. The technique
              uses the piezoelectric effect which involves bringing an extremely sharp metal
              needle within a few angstroms of the sample surface. The distance is small
              enough for electrons to leak or tunnel across the gap and generate a minute
              current. As the gap between the tip and the sample increases, the current
              decreases. As the probe crosses the sample, moving back and forth across the
              surface, it traces out a contour map of the sample's surface atoms. The AFM is
              used in the control of material used to fabricate semiconductor circuits.
