Abstract    :
              
With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program California
              State University- San Bernandino Foundation will acquire an electron
              paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer for scientific research in physics,
              chemistry and biology at a Hispanic serving, predominately, undergraduate
              institute. It will improve the quality of research by providing access to a
              research instrument, which is currently unavailable. It will greatly expand the
              research capabilities in three research all from different departments. The
              instrument will be used to study domain dynamics in ferroelectric materials,
              which have applications to the electronics industry, including "smart cards"
              (physics), environmentally mediated oxidative stress in plants, which is
              important in evaluating ecological impact on plants (biology), and binuclear
              transition metal complexes, which has applications in computer memory
              (chemistry). The research projects would result in scientific publications, and
              presentations, but perhaps the most important result will be students that are
              motivated and capable of doing research. This project would help CSUSB add to
              its reputation of combining research with a strong commitment to undergraduate
              education, particularly for first generation and students from underrepresented
              groups.
