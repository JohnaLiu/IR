Abstract    :
              0116929  Oerther  This grant funds a workshop to explore the value of applying
              molecular biology tools in environmental engineering.  The objectives of the
              workshop include providing answers to four critical questions: (1) Can junior
              faculty in the field of environmental engineering build successful and
              sustainable careers by developing, implementing, and conducting research using
              molecular biology tools? (2) What are the advantages and disadvantages of
              biomolecular technologies, and how should technique development and
              standardization proceed within the environmental engineering community? (3) How
              and to what degree should the field of environmental engineering teach
              molecular biology tools to students, practitioners, and regulators? (4) What
              are current and anticipated examples of knowledge provided by molecular biology
              tools that were previously unavailable, and what is the real value of this
              knowledge to the field? ***
