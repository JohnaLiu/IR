Abstract    :
              This MRI award provides for the purchase of two ultrafast laser systems that
              will serve as the backbone for a two-component high-intensity pulsed laser
              facility in the J. R. Macdonald (JRM) Laboratory in the Physics Department of
              Kansas State University.  The program that the equipment will enable represents
              a marriage of intense laser technology with the ion-beam and momentum-imaging
              expertise and capabilities existing presently in the JRM Laboratory.  Taken
              together, the two capabilities will allow the study of the mechanisms whereby
              electrons are removed from charged and neutral targets by intense laser pulses
              and the study the interaction of (multiply) charged ions with targets "dressed"
              by intense radiation fields. The equipment will be available to all users of
              the JRM facility, including graduate and undergraduate students, post-docs,
              faculty, and outside users.
