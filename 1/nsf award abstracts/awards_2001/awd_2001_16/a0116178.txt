Abstract    :
              A continuing series of grants since 1988 has made it possible for CIRES of the
              University of Colorado, in collaboration with the NOAA Aeronomy Laboratory, to
              construct, operate, and maintain VHF wind-profiling radars at four sites
              stretching across the equatorial Pacific: Biak, Indonesia; Pohnpei, Micronesia;
              Christmas Island, Kiribati; and Piura, Peru.  Observations from the profiler at
              Christmas Island are now assimilated into operational forecast models on a
              routine basis.  Ongoing research activities based on data from the network
              include: (1) documentation of seasonal and interannual variability of winds
              over the Tropical Pacific; (2) investigation of the structure of atmospheric
              Kelvin waves, Rossby waves, and gravity waves; (3) measurement of the vertical
              structure and amount of rainfall at the profiler sites; (4) obtaining data for
              the validation of atmospheric models.  The network fills both research and
              operational needs for data on winds and precipitation in the Tropical Pacific -
              a region important for the global climate, but where other sources of data are
              scarce.
