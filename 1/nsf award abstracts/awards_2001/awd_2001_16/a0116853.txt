Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of California in Los Angeles will
              acquire a 600 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to
              carry out studies on a) oligosaccharide-based glycodendrimers; b) synthesis of
              specific molecular probes; c) complex natural products and analogues; d)
              modular synthesis and polyhedral surface modification of carboranes; e)
              endohedral metal complexes of fullerenes; and f) interlocked molecules in
              electronic devices.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the
              most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure
              of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize
              specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR
              spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
              The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas, in
              particular nanochemistry.
