Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Allegheny College will acquire a 300 MHz
              Fourier-Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) Spectrometer. This
              equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) development of new
              methods for the synthesis of sulfones; b) synthesis of natural products; c)
              study of active centers in metalloproteins; d) development of models to predict
              the stability of RNA structure from sequence; e) development of novel complexes
              to catalyze oxidation reactions of biological, chemical and environmental
              relevance.  This instrument will be used for undergraduates in their research
              and also within the curriculum.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. 
              Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including environmental chemistryand
              biochemistry.
