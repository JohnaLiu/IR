This is a proposal to: (1) build a near-field scanning optical
              microscope (NSOM) capable of phase, fluorescence, polarization and second
              harmonic generation modes, and (2) build a modified NSOM that will use a solid
              metallic tip, rather than a fiberoptic tip, as an aperatureless near field
              optical probe.  The proposed NSOM, having all of the features desired, cannot
              be purchased commercially.  The investigators will purchase all of the major
              components, and then modify and assemble them to yield the desired instrument. 
              This equipment will be used in a number of biomedical engineering research
              projects which include studies on: (1) the mineralization of artificial bone,
              (2) synapse function in neurons, (3) self-assembled fluorosomes for
              cancer-targeted gene delivery, (4) liquid crystal alignment on solid
              substrates, and (5) labeled proteins in the membranes of T cells.
