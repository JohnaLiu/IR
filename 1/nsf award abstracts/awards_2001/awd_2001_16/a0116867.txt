This is a proposal to acquire an industrial micro computed
              tomography (microCT) system to be used for the detailed examination of bone
              samples.  The micro CT system includes a variable power CT, an image
              intensifier, a turntable, and 3D visualization software.  Some of the areas of
              research include: (1) studying three-dimensional trabecular bone architecture,
              (2) investigating molecular mechanisms of bone formation and resorption, (3)
              assessing the quality of bone during healing of fractures, and (4) creating
              more accurate biomechanical joint models.  Engineering applications include
              flaw detection, measurement of fracture or fracture propagation, feature
              recognition, and non-destructive evaluation.
