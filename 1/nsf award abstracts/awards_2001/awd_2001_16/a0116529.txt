A planet-hunting instrument (spectrometer) for the
              new Southern Hemisphere telescope: Magellan will be built. A high-resolution
              echelle spectrograph for the southern hemisphere-located Magellan Telescope
              will be designed, specified, fabricated, assembled and tested. Precision radial
              velocities will be measured to look for the characteristic signature that
              indicates small dark bodies (planets) in orbit about a star. This special
              purpose spectrograph will be able to Doppler velocity changes, at the level of
              2 to 4 m/sec.  This spectrograph-telescope combination will enable over 1,000.
              new candidate stars to be examined for orbiting planets and represents the
              astronomy community's first in-depth survey of those Southern Hemisphere stars
              not available from Northern Hemisphere telescopes.  The telescope/spectrograph
              system will be available to members of the Magellan community: Harvard, MIT,
              Michigan, Arizona and Carnegie Observatories.
