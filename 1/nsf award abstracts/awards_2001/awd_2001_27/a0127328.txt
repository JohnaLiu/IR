Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)
This project develops curriculum support materials for
              use with undergraduate
computer science majors to develop Java based handheld
              and smart-card
applications for the Handheld and Ubiquitous Computing (HUC)
              market. 

Faculty and students are provided with HUC devices and developing
              prototype 
tools to demonstrate their effective use in our curriculum.
              Evaluation and 
assessment of the tools is done using student evaluations
              developed by a 
behavioral psychologist and interviews conducted by an
              independent review 
board of industry specialists. These tools are
              incorporated in two of our required 
and three of our elective courses. The
              tools and modules developed will be 
disseminated over the Internet via
              www.sourceforge.net, in a series of papers, 
and through a forthcoming
              Prentice Hall textbook Java Micro Edition Programming.
