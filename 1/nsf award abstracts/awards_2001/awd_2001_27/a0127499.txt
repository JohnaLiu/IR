Abstract    :
              Engineering - Chemical (53)
We have developed and deployed a number of virtual
              unit operations lab projects. Our lab-based units have been developed to pose
              open-ended "what if" design problems by having students work on real time
              chemical processes. These chemical processes will include distillation and
              polymer crystallization for example. This will enable student on our campus as
              well as students from other campuses, colleges and high schools, to gain
              experience on a wide range of design, scale-up, and start-up problems generated
              by these laboratory projects. We hope to have students gain access to
              experiments that would not otherwise be available to them. These experiments
              can be used either in a classroom or lecture setting. Development efforts have
              involved collaboration between faculty at John Hopkins University and MIT.
