Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will development a smart
              seal using shape memory alloy technology (SMA) combined with elastic foundation
              bedding. The use of active control allows corrections to take place during the
              operation.  Active control protects against seal failure and preserves the
              tribological characteristics. The objective is to develop a class of
              non-contacting mechanical annular seals (e.g. labyrinth, smooth bushing, and
              step) where their clearance can be actively controlled.

The commercial
              benefits from this application will be in compressors and steam/gas turbines.
              This project will have a significant advantage over existing types of labyrinth
              seals by reducing the leakage rates, extending operational life, decreasing
              required maintenance, decreasing fuel consumption or electric power of the
              machinery and will lessen contamination of the environment.
