Abstract    :
              Physics (13) Curriculum materials and Java-based software are being developed to
              make it easier for
faculty to incorporate computer applications into the
              undergraduate physics curriculum.
In particular, the principal investigator,
              in colloboration with Jan Tobochnik of
Kalamazoo College and Wolfgang
              Christian of Davidson College, is developing an extensive
and powerful library
              of Java utilities and templates that make it relatively easy to
develop
              computer simulations and animations in a variety of contexts. The software
              is
platform independent and open source and available at no cost. In addition,
              the third
(Java) edition of our popular undergraduate level computer
              simulation text is being developed
during the time frame of the work.
