Abstract    :
              This project is developing, implementing, and evaluating assessment tools and
              methods that support continuous improvement in student preparation in
              electrical and computer engineering design and related areas. Educational
              research has developed findings which suggest that engineering education would
              be improved by deliberately and carefully assessing important educational
              outcomes and building continuous improvement loops around courses and
              curricula. One of the most important goals of engineering education is
              preparing students to succeed in developing solutions to large-scale,
              ill-structured design problems that are typical of senior capstone design
              project courses and the professional world of engineering practice.   The
              project is using the knowledge of expert functioning provided by cognitive
              science and instructional research to identify crucial aspects of the design
              process. It is developing multiple measures and gathering data to verify that
              these aspects are significant components of design skill. In broad terms, the
              components of expertise that are being addressed are declarative knowledge,
              procedural knowledge, and metacognitive processing knowledge. These are being
              illuminated by the development of quantitative ways to measure quality of
              design. Declarative knowledge (including "facts") tends to build and become
              refined with experience, and its structure tends to become organized in more
              abstract schemas with experience, allowing it to be applied confidently to a
              greater range of problems. Procedural knowledge is understanding how to address
              problems efficiently. Metacognitive processing knowledge is particularly
              significant for developing lifelong learning skills. It is developed as
              students learn to think broadly about how they are solving particular problems
              and seek better or more efficient approaches for future use. This is knowledge
              that requires planning, self-monitoring, and reflection. Its growth responds to
              deliberate efforts to develop it by instructors.   The approach is being
              class tested in sophomore design courses and senior project design courses in
              two engineering areas, electronic and computer software design. Participating
              instructors are evaluating the assessments, writing improvement plans, and
              implementing these over a period of three years. The project is producing three
              distinctive products. First, it is producing assessments of various components
              of design skill, with reliability and validity findings. Second, it is
              evaluating the effectiveness of these assessment measures for use in
              course-based continuous improvement of student learning. Finally, the
              assessments of sophomore knowledge in the first year of the project is being
              used to predict their performance in their senior design courses.
