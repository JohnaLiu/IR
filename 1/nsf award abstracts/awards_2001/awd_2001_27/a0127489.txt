Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

This project addresses two national needs: the
              quality of Science, Technological, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
              education for all students needs improvement; and the participation of
              populations currently underrepresented in the STEM pipeline needs to be
              increased, thus increasing the pool of professionals available for the careers
              in science and engineering. The general goal of the project is therefore to
              improve the success rate of undergraduate students in STEM disciplines,
              particularly targeting minority populations. The specific objectives pursued in
              order to achieve this goal are formulated in order to enhance student
              motivation, increase student time on task, strengthen student problem solving
              and analytical skills, and enhance the participation of faculty at minority
              serving institutions in effecting STEM education improvement. In order to
              accomplish these objectives, the Virginia Tech Emporium is adapted and
              implemented. Other innovative educational materials that incorporate
              information technology and STEM discipline specific applications to enhance
              content and motivate students are developed, and a model Lecture-Laboratory
              Calculus course is developed and tested which incorporates these materials.
