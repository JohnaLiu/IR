Abstract    :
              Darbha Swaroop  Texas Engineering Experiment Station NSF/USDOT: Development of
              an information technology based advanced monitoring and inspection system for
              air brakes in commercial vehicles systems for air brakes  The principal
              research goal of this project is to design novel fault detection algorithms for
              air brake systems in commercial vehicles with a view towards applying them in
              the development of automatic maintenance and enforcement inspections and in the
              development of real-time, on-board monitoring systems. This proposal is
              motivated by considerations of preventive and active vehicle safety, since no
              such diagnostic and monitoring system currently exists for air brakes in
              trucks.   The PIs intend to develop a mathematical model of an air brake
              system for diagnostic purposes and adopt the analytical redundancy approach for
              Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI). Using the air brake model, brake pressure
              will be predicted from the measurements of the pedal position and wheel speed;
              the difference between the measured and predicted values of brake pressure will
              be used to assess the degradation in braking performance. The air brake system
              model will be experimentally validated and the diagnostic algorithms will be
              implemented on the test bench developed by the PI with the support of Bendix
              CVS Inc., at Elyria, OH and the SWUTC program of the Texas Transportation
              Institute. The tools developed in this project will be applicable to a wide
              variety of industrial machinery.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be
              engaged in the development and implementation of FDI algorithms. Finally, the
              test bench, models and the diagnostic algorithms will be integrated into
              relevant undergraduate and graduate courses.
