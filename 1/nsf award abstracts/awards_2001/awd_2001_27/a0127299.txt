Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)
An undergraduate education is a critical link between
              high school and a society increasingly dependent upon computer technology. SMET
              majors increasingly need computer programming as a fundamental skill. Students
              effectively learn computer programming by using examples, yet the number of
              examples that can be presented in class and in a textbook is limited. 

The
              cognitive approaches of collaborative and discovery learning supported by the
              intellectual scaffolding of a robust set of examples can give students a deep
              understanding of concepts they discover on their own. Assignment of computer
              programming problems just beyond a student's current skill level functions as
              the 'leading question', where carefully constructed examples give the student
              the information necessary to construct a mental model leading to the solution
              to the problem. This can help overcome the cognitive bottleneck where too few
              students negotiate the transition from lower-level skills to higher-level
              skills, from basic rote memorization and re-telling skills to more abstract
              knowledge synthesizing and transforming skills.

The difficulty lies in
              getting a complete set of the right examples. This project creates a web-based
              system which gives intuitive access to between 300 and 500 examples
              illustrating the main points in the C++ programming language. A prototype is
              being implemented in a pilot study over two years, being used with 300
              undergraduate students taking an introductory programming course at UIC.
              Evaluation will use both web-based statistics and evaluation forms, comparing
              student skill levels and attitudes before and after the system's
              implementation.
