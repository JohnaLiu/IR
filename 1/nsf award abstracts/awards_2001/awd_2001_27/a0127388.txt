Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
TIEE (Teaching Issues and Experiments in Ecology) is a
              web and CD-ROM
resource designed to help faculty incorporate more
              student-active approaches in ecology
courses. TIEE is composed of 3
              interrelated parts: 1) inquiry-based experiments, 2) controversial issues for
              lecture and 3) linked and interwoven teaching resources. TIEE also addresses
              the reward system for educational innovation because Experiments or Issues
              submitted by faculty are peer reviewed by TIEE editors. During 1999-2000, with
              CCLI-EMD Proof-of-Concept support, we built a model TIEE website and CD-ROM
              which we evaluated in a workshop at the annual meeting of the Ecological
              Society of America (ESA) in Aug. 2000. Faculty applied and worked in small
              groups with the CD-ROM; they evaluated the overall product plus assigned
              Experiments or Issues. The evaluation of the workshop and of TIEE was very
              positive and helpful to the current project. We also established a TIEE board
              of editors who we met with at this meeting. In this full submission we are
              building on our successes with the proof. The ESA is publishing an annual issue
              of TIEE on its website and distributing the CD-ROM. We are training faculty to
              write and use Issues and Experiments at Introductory and Author workshops at
              ESA plus AIBS and AAAS meetings. In this proposal we describe the guidelines
              and structure for submissions of Issues and Experiments to TIEE, the processes
              for peer and editorial review, and the sustainability of TIEE following this
              granting period.
