Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore
              the processing of boron nitride (BN) composites for a wide variety of wear
              applications with a focus on aircraft brakes.  Significant research has been
              performed worldwide to develop greatly improved braking materials at
              significantly lower cost.  Of the approaches under consideration, a composite
              using BN as a matrix appears best in terms of desired cost-performance
              characteristics.  Phase I will produce stable boron nitride composites from a
              unique pre-ceramic polymer (borazine) that allows for simple impregnation.  The
              oxidative and hydrolytic stability of these composites is greatly improved over
              current carbon fiber/carbon (C/C).  Based on preliminary testing, a carbon
              fiber/carbon-BN matrix displayed a five-fold decrease in wear as compared to
              C/C.
     C/C matrix composites have been used extensively for both military
              and commercial aircraft brakes since they were first developed in the mid-1960s
              and later optimized in the early 1970s.  Problems with such systems include
              rapid wear at elevated temperatures leading to frequent replacement.  In fact,
              commercial airlines consider the maintenance of brakes to be the second most
              serious cost problem.
