Abstract    :
              The Edward Bouchet Abdus Salam Institute (EBASI) will convene its Fourth
              International Conference on Physics and High Technology for Africa August 6-10,
              2001 in Contonou, Benin West Africa.  The focus of this conference is on
              implications and relevance in current advances in pure and applied physics for
              emerging telecommunications technologies.  The meeting is planned in
              conjunction with the Telecommunication Authority of Benin.  The Institute for
              Mathematics and Physical Sciences (IMSP) of the National University of Benin,
              and the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP).  The conference
              will consist of invited and selected presentations from refereed submissions. 
              The conference proceedings will be published.  The expected participants will
              include physicists and applied mathematicians from the African Continent from
              the United States and Europe.  In addition to the motivations for scientific
              exchanges, the conference is also designed to allow all participants the
              opportunity to explore the possibilities for mutually beneficial
              transcontinental collaborations.
