Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)
We are exploring a new pedagogical approach to software
              engineering education which seeks to integrate analysis tools with instruction
              in programming methodologies. Instead of learning methodologies as abstract
              ideas, students directly benefit from applying analysis tools that embody
              methodologies to large, realistic programs.

The approach focuses on using
              lightweight analysis tools that offer to the students clear and immediate
              benefits with minimal initial costs. The tools help students understand
              information hiding, invariants, memory management and security within the
              context of full industrial scale programs.
