Abstract    :
              Given the technological advancements in sensors and wireless communications,
              future motor vehicles will be capable of reporting a wide variety of
              information about their own conditions and the local environment, including the
              condition of the infrastructure that they are on.  Even though many uses exist
              for the vehicle and infrastructure related information transmitted from the
              motor vehicles, currently there is no necessity for this information to be
              available for anything other than the private use of the motor vehicle owner. 
               The research project focuses on identifying possible social uses of motor
              vehicle information and of possible ways to address technical and
              organizational barriers for greater use of this information.  The research
              objectives are: (1) to identify ways in which motor vehicle sensor information
              could best be collected, communicated and managed to provide access yet ensure
              privacy, (2) to identify potential uses and benefits of the information
              collected from motor vehicles, and (3) to develop an appropriate business plan
              for financing and managing of the information collected. The research approach
              includes a wide-ranging and inter-disciplinary investigation of system wide
              effects with the expectation of identifying economies of scale and synergies
              among different data uses.  The expected contributions of this exploratory
              research include a list of discipline specific and interdisciplinary research
              issues, and a clear research agenda and a business plan for exploiting
              motor-vehicle information and communications technology.
