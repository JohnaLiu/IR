Abstract    :
              Through integration of advanced gas chromatography with mass spectrometry
              (GC-MS) detection across the chemistry curriculum and into the biology and
              geoscience curriculum, student understanding of complex environmental issues is
              being expanded. A spiraled approach starting in General Chemistry and
              continuing with guided-inquiry, project-based laboratory experiences throughout
              the curriculum is developing student expertise using this powerful hyphenated
              technology toward solving important issues. The topics and the experiments are
              being adapted and implemented from the chemical and research literature and
              include multiple uses for the GC-MS. The GC-MS is also being used across
              discipline lines (ecology and geoscience) to strengthen existing collaborations
              and to encourage additional ones and to illustrate the interdisciplinary nature
              of scientific inquiry.
