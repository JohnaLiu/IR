Abstract    :
              The anthropologically rich Afar region of East Africa has been a prolific area
              of research for human origins.  The northernmost reaches of the Afar in the
              newly founded State of Eritrea have been untapped to this point.  This award is
              to undertake fieldwork in the northern Afar.  It is important for, 1)
              understanding the earliest history of humankind in Africa 2) understanding the
              northernmost range of early human ancestors on the African continent, 3)
              understanding when and where our species, Homo sapiens left Africa, and 4)
              understanding the biogeography of humans and our ancestors in one of the worlds
              most geologically active areas.

The researchers will survey, map and surface
              collect sites in the northern Afar (Danakil depression) four to five weeks. 
              All specimens will be catalogued and deposited in the National Museum of
              Eritrea.  Description and analysis of fossils and artifacts will take place in
              Asmara.  Rock samples for petrographic and isotope analysis will be transported
              to the United States and South Africa for analysis.  The research team will
              consist of scientists from the United States, Eritrea and South Africa.
