Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
A growing body of literature amply documents the low
              levels of scientific literacy
among the American public. To address this issue
              we are providing a framework in which
large numbers of undergraduates can
              achieve basic scientific literacy. We are
accomplishing this goal through
              development of a general biology laboratory course for
approximately 2325
              students per year including non-science majors, underrepresented
minorities
              and future K-16 teachers. This course is adapting materials from Oklahoma State
              University, New York University, Sweetbriar College, Wellesley College, and
              Project Kaleidoscope The new biology course utilizes project-based learning and
              critical thinking skill development to introduce and allow discussion of
              relevant scientific concepts. Expected project outcomes include: graduates able
              to engage in scientifically aware behavior and informed citizenship, improved
              scientific knowledge, and an appreciation of the connections between science
              and "real-world" problems. The project is yielding innovative hands-on,
              minds-on laboratory activities suitable for large numbers of students that are
              available for adaptation by other institutions through a published laboratory
              manual. Dissemination is being accomplished through a project web site,
              presentations at national meetings, faculty development workshops, publication
              of laboratory materials and professional articles. This model is one that can
              be easily adapted by other institutions and, therefore has excellent potential
              for other universities who teach large numbers of students.
