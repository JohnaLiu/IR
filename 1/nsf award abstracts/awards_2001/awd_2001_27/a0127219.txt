Abstract    :
              Engineering - Mechanical (56)
This is a Full-Scale-Development Proposal based
              on a successful Proof-of-Concept Grant
(NSF Award No. 9952653) demonstrating
              an innovative approach to materials for upper-
division undergraduate
              engineering education. The value of visual materials in conveying 
technical
              concepts is very well established, and is here applied in a multimedia form to
              
the topic of thermofluid dynamics (i.e. convective heat transfer,
              thermodynamics, and gas 
dynamics), with strong emphasis on experimentation
              and optical flow visualization. The 
results are materials captured on one or
              more CD-ROMs that can be used by instructors 
and students as a visual
              supplement to any of the standard textbooks on these topics. 
The suitability
              of such materials for national dissemination has already been
              demonstrated.
This approach makes use of the ubiquity and low-cost of CD-ROM
              technology, 
which makes it especially important for small and minority
              universities that sometimes 
lack the facilities to convey the laboratory
              experience directly to their students. The
major SMET challenge being
              addressed is that of enhancing traditional engineering 
education with
              highly-visual material not currently available, and thus conveying to
              
students a sense of the research-laboratory experience. One DUE theme also
              addressed 
here is faculty development, by providing faculty with an unusual
              supplementary 
teaching tool, thus broadening their preparation beyond what is
              traditionally available
in textbooks. Integration of technology is also a
              component part of this project. That is,
during the learning, the course
              materials require the students to use computers and to 
interface with
              multimedia systems environments.
