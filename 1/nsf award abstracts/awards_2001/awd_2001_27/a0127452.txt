Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)
Closed laboratories have become common in the computer
              science educational community as a means of enhancing student achievement.
              However, circumstances for many departments have changed since the original
              push to closed laboratories: rapid advances in web-based technologies and
              increasing ownership of networked personal computers by students makes it even
              less sensible to use closed laboratories to deliver exercises or tutorial
              activities and many institutions are facing increasing enrollments, shortage of
              space, or reduced budgets for laboratory assistants that require departments to
              ensure that resource expensive closed laboratory components for courses are
              used as wisely as possible.

In this project we are re-examining the
              strengths of the closed laboratory model and assessing methods and technology
              for learning outside a closed laboratory in order to deliver better practicum
              experiences for students and to reduce a department's costs for developing and
              delivering closed-laboratory components in a computing curriculum.

We
              are:
(1) analyzing the needs for a closed-laboratory component for a course
              and also for the set of student activities carried out during a course's weekly
              laboratory sessions;
(2) determining what practicum-oriented student
              activities are best served in a closed laboratory environment and which can
              effectively be handled outside a closed laboratory session;
(3) identifying
              and documenting a set of best-practices of techniques and tools that can
              support effective learning activities for closed laboratories, and also for
              activities that are better moved to an open laboratory situation;
and
(4)
              using this set of best-practices to define a development guide for how to plan
              and implement laboratory components.
