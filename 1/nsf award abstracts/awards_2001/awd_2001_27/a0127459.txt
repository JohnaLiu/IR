Abstract    :
              Engineering - Mechanical (56)
The objective of this project is the integration
              of simulation technology into undergraduate education through the development
              of teaching modules (TM) for complementary computational fluid dynamics (CFD),
              experimental fluid dynamics (EFD), and uncertainty analysis (UA) for use in
              teaching undergraduate fluid mechanics courses and laboratories. Faculty
              partners from colleges of engineering at small and large public, small private,
              and small historically minority private universities are collaborating on the
              development of the TM, the effective implementation, the evaluation, the
              dissemination, and the pedagogy of simulation technology using web-based
              techniques. The evaluation plan includes collaboration with faculty from the
              University of Iowa, College of Education, the Department of Psychology and
              Quantitative Foundation and Center for Evaluation Assessment. The TM include
              three parts: 1) lectures on CFD and EFD methodology and standard procedures and
              UA; 2) CFD templates for academic use of commercial industrial CFD software; 3)
              exercise notes for use of CFD templates and complementary EFD and UA. The
              commercial industrial CFD software is FLUENT, http://www.fluent.com/, which is
              a widely used CFD software in many industries and universities and a partner in
              the present work. Faculty development activities are occurring in parts 1) and
              3) of the production of the TM, and during part 2), faculty development
              activities are occurring during the generation of TM specifications and
              collaboration with FLUENT on design of CFD templates. FLUENT is providing
              software development and testing of CFD templates; training of faculty in the
              use of CFD templates; national/international self-sustaining web-based
              distribution of the TM, including all parts 1) -3); and free faculty use of
              FLUENT/Flowlab. Faculty partners will meet yearly for development of the TM and
              collaboration and training with FLUENT/Flowlab. The initial capability of the
              TM are based on those capabilities developed in the proof-of-concept at The
              University of Iowa in spring semester 1999, fall semester 2000, and spring
              semester 2001. The results from this prior effort may be reviewed at
              http://www.icaen.uiwa.edu/~fluids/.
