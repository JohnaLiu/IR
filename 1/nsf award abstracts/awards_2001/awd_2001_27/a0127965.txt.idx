Abstract    :
              This project will investigate methods for improving the scheduling of intermodal
              trucks with the objective of reducing empty miles improving customer service. 
              In the real world, truck operations in any traffic network contain a fairly
              high degree of uncertainties including arrival of new orders, cancellation of
              existing orders, variable waiting times and variable travel times due to
              traffic congestion.  To fully capture the capabilities of these technologies in
              the trucking industry, quick and efficient algorithms, capable of providing
              good solutions in real time, are still needed.  In this one-year exploratory
              grant, the focus will be on the problem of scheduling trucks serving a
              centralized port area with many feeder/end customers.  This dynamic hybrid
              solution methodology consists of a fast dynamic program in conjunction with a
              search technique (such as genetic algorithms).  Theory and methodology
              developed in this research can be expanded in later years to solve more general
              dynamic routing problems.  The researchers will validate the dynamic approach
              using actual data that contains several truck depots, container terminals,
              intermodal facilities and end customers.  The elimination of international
              trade barriers, lower tariffs and shifting centers of global manufacturing and
              consumption, has lead to new dynamics in intermodal shipping. Worldwide
              container trade is growing at a 9.5% annual rate, and the U.S. growth rate is
              around 6%. Every major port is anticipated to at least double its cargo by
              2020. As a consequence, truck traffic in the vicinity of the nation's ports is
              likely to grow substantially, leading to increased roadway congestion, and
              delays for both ordinary drivers and for the import and export of goods.
