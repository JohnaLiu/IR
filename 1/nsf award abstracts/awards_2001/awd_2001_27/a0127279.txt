Abstract    :
              Engineering - Civil (54)
We are meeting the growing need for genomics studies
              in undergraduate education by creating a course entitled "Molecular Methods in
              Environmental Engineering". An integral part of our course has been to create
              teams of students collaborating through the use of inquiry based laboratory
              modules. These student are performing group projects following the "full-cycle
              16S rRNA approach". This course has been popular among our students in Civil
              and Environmental Engineering program. Our curriculum materials have been
              designed to be incorporated into other disciplines e.g. Biomedical Engineering
              and Chemical Engineering on other campuses. This material has undergone
              extensive testing and evaluation by our staff. We have created a laboratory
              manual with an accompanying CDROM for dissemination of these laboratory
              experiments through appropriate commercial channels. Additional support
              materials are also available on the World Wide Web to help faculty and their
              students. We are presenting present papers in peer reviewed journals like the
              Journal of Engineering Education. We also plan to make a presentation at the
              upcoming AEESP/AAEE Conference on Education and Research Needs in Environmental
              Engineering and Science on August 11-13, 2002 at the University of Toronto.
