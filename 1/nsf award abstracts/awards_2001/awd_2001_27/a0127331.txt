Abstract    :
              Geology (42)
High quality color maps that plot the location of and display
              analytical datasets, descriptions, images, or movies are difficult to publish
              in a format that facilitates their easy access, distribution and use. The need
              for them is clear: most professional geologic meetings start and end with
              map-based field trips, students are taught using them, and they form the
              backbone of many geologic research projects. With previous NSF funding, the PI
              developed a proof-of-concept solution on the Macintosh, called the Dynamic
              Digital Map. DDMs display data using several methods, including point-and-click
              at icons pin-pointing locations on maps, from lists of samples or sites, and by
              linked text. The data displayed by a DDM come from spreadsheets, or files
              created in CAD or GIS programs by any author who inserts or links it into a DDM
              Template, following instructions in a "DDM Cookbook". The finished DDM becomes
              a freely distributable "stand alone" program, running with no additional
              software. This project continues and accelerates the Macintosh-only DDM
              conversion to a cross-platform program (Win32, Macintosh, Linux) that is web
              enabled and allows information to be expressed at different user levels (e.g.
              from the professional to the junior high earth-science class) in one DDM, thus
              encompassing a wide audience. Dissemination is by WWW (including DLESE) and CD,
              with reviews and testing in several institutions. The first workshop on how to
              create and use DDMs is being held at the Geological Society of America
              Northeast Sectional meeting March 24, 2002.
