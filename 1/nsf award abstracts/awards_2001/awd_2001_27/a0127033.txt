Abstract    :
              Astronomy (11) This project updates computers in two laboratory courses in
              astronomy and meteorology in the Department of Physics and Astronomy for use by
              nonscience students. About a quarter of the college's enrollment are using the
              computing facilities in this project. The project is adapting material from the
              internet to access scientific and technological databases worldwide, for
              example, meteorological and astronomical images. In addition, the project is
              using the CLEA labs for astronomy and adapting labs for use with an existing
              remote-controlled telescope. The project has several objectives. First,
              students gain valuable experience with computers. Second, students use data
              from the latest science and technology. Third, computer projects properly
              integrated into a laboratory are a good mechanism to increase the interest of
              non-science students.
