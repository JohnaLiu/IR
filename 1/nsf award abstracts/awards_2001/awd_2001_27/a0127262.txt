Abstract    :
              Engineering - Materials Science (57)
The mummified remains of the copper-age
              man Otzi in the Alps in 1991 helps us understand how people lived around 3,500
              BC. We also discovered the tools he used to hunt with and helped him to survive
              thus gaining important insights as to the peoples' understanding of materials
              around that time. Using Otzi as a focal point for materials science issues has
              provided us with a wealth of opportunity to explore science, math, engineering,
              and technology (SMET) concepts. We have developed a single prototype web-based
              module that uses a constructivist approach and an "interrupted lecture" method
              that integrates the instructor's lecture with content from our module. This
              module is meant to be used as an in class experience which will be supplemented
              by online materials to better educate students with different learning styles.
              We have engaged non-science majors along with physics and materials engineering
              students in our freshman materials science class. The key problem that we have
              addressed is the need to help both non-science and engineering majors develop
              problem solving skills using this thematic approach for structuring SMET
              content in materials science. Using this thematic approach our module will
              include human evolution, art, exploration, politics, health, and
              transportation, to name a few.
