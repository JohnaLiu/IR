Abstract    :
              Engineering -- Other (59)

This project integrates medical-imaging research
              and new technologies into the undergraduate biomedical engineering curriculum.
              It develops a series of courses and a new software package that provides
              dynamic simulations of commonly used medical imaging systems. As a prototype,
              the PI is developing a CT simulator that includes web pages illustrating
              principles and devices along with a Java package allowing the users to view the
              results as an image is processed step-by-step. Using this material, the PI is
              establishing a web-based medical imaging laboratory/library accessible through
              the Internet. The assessment process involves an evaluation of the plans by
              faculty colleagues, teaching evaluations and exit interviews with graduating
              students, and an evaluation by an external review committee and employers'
              feedback. In addition to establishing the web-based laboratory/library, the PI
              plans to present papers at the ASEE and the IEEE EMBS meetings to disseminate
              his work.
