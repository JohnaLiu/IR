Abstract    :
              This grant supports the participation of Dr. Frank and his Co-PI, Johannes
              Verlinde, in the CRYSTAL-FACE project, which stands for Cirrus Regional Study
              of Tropical Anvils and Cirrus Layers - Florida Area Cirrus Experiment.  This is
              an interagency field program to be conducted in and around southern Florida in
              the summer of 2002 with the goal of studying the formation, evolution, and
              radiative properties of the cirrus anvil clouds created by large convective
              clouds in the tropics.  Dr. Frank will use an NRL P3 aircraft fitted with the
              NSF ELDORA radar to document the life cycles of deep convective cloud systems
              from the time of their inception until the development of widespread cirrus
              anvils.  The main objective is to estimate the convective transport of total
              water substance (vapor plus condensate) into the cirrus cloud layer.  This is
              accomplished by first computing the vertical air velocity from the profile of
              horizontal divergence derived from Doppler radar observations, and then
              inferring the water flux by combining the estimated mass flux of air with
              results of large-eddy simulations that include parameterized precipitation. 
              The results will be synthesized to assess the influence of convective water
              transports on the global population of cirrus clouds, including estimates of
              their effect on the Earth's radiation budget.
