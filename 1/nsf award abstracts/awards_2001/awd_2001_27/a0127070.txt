Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
This project is supporting an advanced Laboratory
              Course in Developmental Genetics. The course provides a cooperative,
              research-based learning experience that complements upper level lecture courses
              in genetics, cell biology and developmental biology. The critical reasoning and
              problem-solving strategies that student are exposed to in this laboratory
              course are expected to have a broad impact on their overall intellectual
              development. This laboratory course uses Drosophila and Xenopus, two important
              model systems for current research, to explore a number of fundamental
              principles in developmental biology and genetics. Research grade microscopes
              are used to enhance the students ability to obtain hands-on experience with
              embryological experimentation in these two biological systems. Digital-imaging
              equipment is being used for both the purpose of demonstration and for student
              collection and analysis of experimental results. This laboratory course is
              adapting exercises in vertebrate experimental embryology from Harvard
              University (MCB116) and from an EMBO Practical Course in Drosophila Embryology.
              An important feature of the course is an inquiry-based approach that strongly
              encourages cooperative learning by the students. This laboratory course is an
              innovative addition to the curriculum and is helping to formalize a new
              paradigm for integrating research and education at Stony Brook.
