Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21). This proof-of-concept project is creating a
              Web-based set of instructional materials consisting of a database of
              interactive mathematical curves, a "National Curve Bank," together with
              exercises related to the characteristics of these curves. Three mathematical
              areas are under development: Precalculus, Calculus, and the History of
              Mathematics; and within each of these areas, links to specific topics allow
              students to access and make use of a wide variety of curves. Accompanying
              exercises ask the student to manipulate the curves or investigate their
              attributes. A prototype for this project has been investigated, featuring
              animation and interactive components. Such a "National Curve Bank" expects to
              provide students with immediate feedback and permit faculty to add an active
              learning component to various courses.
