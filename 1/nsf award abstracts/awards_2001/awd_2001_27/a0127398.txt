Abstract    :
              This project restructures two statistics courses, Introduction to Biostatistics
              and Experimental Methods. The learning environment is transformed through
              interactive labs, collaborative projects, and frequent formative assessments.
              Students spend the majority of class time in computer studio labs gaining
              hands-on experience with statistical analysis both individually and in teams.
              The project team develops discipline specific materials and activities that
              take full advantage of the current technologies to tailor courses to the
              students' needs. 

The objectives of the project include; 1) increasing
              students' mastery of statistical strategies; 2) improving their ability to
              transfer knowledge of statistical concepts to problems in different
              disciplines; and 3) fostering the collaborative skills that their professional
              lives will require.
