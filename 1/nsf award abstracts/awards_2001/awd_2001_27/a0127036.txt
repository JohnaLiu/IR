Abstract    :
              Engineering - Mechanical (56)

The project is modeled on successful existing
              implementations of undergraduate robotics efforts at MIT and Swarthmore, but
              with a specific emphasis on the freshman and sophomore experience. The
              investigators are purchasing equipment to develop and implement the Laboratory
              for Undergraduate Robotics Education (LURE), permitting them to develop new,
              technologically advanced laboratory space for undergraduate education. The
              laboratory allows them to change to a mode of teaching that provides analysis,
              design, and manufacturing skills in a robotics setting. The equipment requested
              also permits them to inject engineering content with a hands-on laboratory
              component into the curriculum at an early stage (freshman year). This provides
              some perspective and motivation to beginning students, who currently receive
              the impression that engineering consists only of theoretical physics and
              mathematics. In the evaluation study, they are investigating how the
              differences in background preparation and training of incoming students affect
              development for high-tech courses related to robotics. They are developing and
              disseminating robotic-related curricular materials for use both in
              interdisciplinary college-level education, as well as K-12 outreach programs.
