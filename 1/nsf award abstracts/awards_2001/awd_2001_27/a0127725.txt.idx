Abstract    :
              An NSF-funded national dissemination project, "Disseminating Successful
              Strategies for Fieldwork in Undergraduate Science Curricula" (DUE 0088217),
              also known as the "Regional Workshops Project" (RWP), began a 5-year effort in
              2001 that will eventually conduct 15 regional workshops for 300 undergraduate
              faculty at the rate of 3 per year. The RWP is engaged in establishing
              professional learning communities of faculty who 1) create and deliver
              undergraduate SMET courses that demonstrate that environmental problem solving
              is an integrative, challenging, effective way to engage undergraduate majors
              and non-majors, 2) use concepts and field/ laboratory techniques suitable for
              teaching undergraduates how science is done in a real-world, problem solving
              context, and 3) use research-based knowledge of how to assess student learning
              and support their capacity for development as educators on an environmental
              problem solving-based curriculum for undergraduate SMET courses. This ASA
              project is simultaneously examining the effects of the NSF-funded Regional
              Workshops Project (RWP) on improved faculty capacity to foster increased
              student learning. The approach is to study both the faculty capacity
              development initiated by the RWP workshops and sustained by interactions and
              resources (both planned and unplanned) available to faculty following their
              workshop experience, and the effects of these faculty capacity building
              processes on student learning. More specifically, this project is studying: 1)
              the development of RWP participants' capacity to use research on SMET learning
              and assessment practices in ways that result in changes in the participants
              approaches and attitudes toward teaching; 2) the extent to which faculty are
              supported while undertaking significant change in their curriculum and pedagogy
              (where pedagogy includes assessment activities) in ways that result in
              improvements in the participants' abilities to develop, sustain, and
              institutionalize their new environmental problem solving-based courses; and 3)
              the extent to which students in SMET courses : a) learn SMET concepts in a
              meaningful way (as defined by Novak, 1999); b) construct a view of SMET
              disciplines that is consistent with views held by experts in those disciplines;
              c) construct integrative conceptual frameworks to facilitate their
              understanding of SMET disciplines; and d) develop positive attitudes and
              perceptions about SMET disciplines.  The project is providing the RWP PIs and
              regional workshop leaders with formative evaluation of the effectiveness of the
              regional workshops, and tested instruments and an easy-to-use analysis and
              report process that workshop leaders can use to undertake formative evaluation
              of other faculty development workshops with similar goals. These formative
              evaluations will be designed to help workshop leaders improve the format,
              content, delivery, and "climate" of the workshop. A tangible outcome will be a
              tested longitudinal assessment/evaluation process that SMET faculty can adapt
              to gather credible, dependable, transferable, and confirmable feedback that 1)
              guides course changes in support of improved student learning and 2) fosters
              their own professional growth and development.
