Abstract    :
              Physics (13) In order to better attract and retain students, the physics
              department is beginning a new research and teaching emphasis in optics. About
              half of a new 4-credit-hour research preparation course is devoted to optics.
              For the research preparation course, the project is adapting and implementing
              optics experiments that were developed at Boston University and New Jersey
              Institute of
Technology with funding from NSF. Experiments are chosen to both
              to prepare students to carry out independent research projects in holographic
              interferometry and to give them exposure to the rapidly developing field of
              fiber optics. The project is supporting laser beam characterizing equipment,
              modal analysis, a fiber optics kit, optical table, and hardware. The project is
              adapting the experiments to the smaller institutional size and to focus on
              holography. In the first implementation of the course, students choose one of
              these experiments as a special project. Using the existing materials and the
              new equipment, they set it up and demonstrate it to their classmates. Their
              work is then the basis for use by future students.
