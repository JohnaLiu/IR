Abstract    :
              This project is creating an outcomes assessment instrument to identify
              engineering student misconceptions in thermal and transport science courses,
              such as thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and mass transfer. The
              instrument focuses on misconceptions concerning fundamental molecular-level and
              atomic-level phenomena, including heat, light, diffusion, chemical reactions,
              and electricity, which differ in significant ways from observable, macroscopic
              causal behavior.

Important student misconceptions identified by surveying
              experienced engineering faculty are validated through student interviews for
              inclusion in a multiple-choice pencil-and-paper instrument patterned after
              successful misconception instruments such as the Force Concept Inventory.
              

The instrument is being field tested to demonstrate its validity and
              reliability and its usefulness for both course-level and program-level
              assessment of student misconceptions in thermal and transport science topics.
              The instrument is designed to allow for pre-testing (at the beginning of a
              course or curriculum) and post-testing (at the end of a course or curriculum)
              to measure changes in student mental model development.
