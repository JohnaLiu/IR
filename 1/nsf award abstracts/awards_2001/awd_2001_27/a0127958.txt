NSF/USDOT:
              Towards a Systems Integration Urban Network Performance Measure - Scalability
              and Data Issues of the Two-Fluid Model

To advance the integration of
              information technologies in surface transportation systems, this research will
              experiment with the utilization of real-time video-based traffic flow data
              collected from camera arrays along a street corridor for traffic control and
              city transportation system modeling. The research is expected to enable the
              transportation control system to interact with the traffic environment, to
              acquire and understand the traffic situations based on sensory inputs, and to
              make intelligent decisions about the circumstances where the traffic control
              tasks are to be performed.  

The proposed research will focus on the
              following objectives. (1) Video handoff and target vehicle tracking, (2)
              Traffic flow information extraction, and (3) Vehicle driving pattern modeling
              and identification (e.g., identifying individual vehicles that demonstrate
              dangerous behavior or potentially at risk). To achieve these objectives, the
              research activities of this project will be divided into three task phases: (1)
              the image acquisition and pre-processing phase, (2) vehicle tracking and
              hand-off processing phase, and (3) the traffic video understanding (vehicle
              driving pattern recognition) phase.
