Abstract    :
              Engineering - Mechanical (56)
This project is developing fourteen experiments
              and building seventeen apparatuses for an undergraduate laboratory designed for
              conducting experiments in Mechanics of Materials and Dynamics of Machinery. The
              experiments and the apparatus being developed through this project may be
              utilized as starting points for the new laboratories or used to strengthen the
              existing laboratories. 

Undergraduate students are participating in
              research, design and development stages of the project in materializing all
              components of a "Model Laboratory". The project is helping them to improve
              their skills in working in teams, and their appreciation for cost-effective and
              superior designs. The outcomes of the project consist of:
1. Developing
              blueprints for fabrication of apparatuses necessary for precision
              experimentation in the areas of Mechanics of Materials and Dynamics of
              Machinery.
2. Creating detailed laboratory manuals for distribution to
              students.
3. Building a comprehensive plan for putting together an affordable
              model laboratory that successfully addresses the fundamental requirements of
              undergraduate laboratories in civil and mechanical engineering as well as
              engineering technology programs.
4. Enhancing the capabilities of future
              engineers/educators by involving them in the process of research, design, and
              development of experiments and equipment.
