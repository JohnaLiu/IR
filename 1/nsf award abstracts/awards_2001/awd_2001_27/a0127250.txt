Abstract    :
              Geology (42)
We are designing and constructing an artificial rock outcrop on
              our campus at the University of New Orleans. Louisiana has no natural rock
              outcrops, which impacts how local students learn geology. Students have
              tremendous difficulty with 3-D spatial-visualization thinking and often have
              minimal exposure to field geology and natural outcrops. Although Louisiana is
              ideal for studying recent sedimentary processes it offers few opportunities for
              inquiry about rocks and outcrops, both of which are essential for geology. This
              proof-of-concept project is the first step in addressing these challenges. The
              outcrop is being used by a large population of students and is designed to
              promote collaboration between the Colleges of Science and Education and the
              local school system. The artificial outcrop is one way we are trying to recruit
              underrepresented students into the sciences, particularly geology.
