Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
The Transformation 2005 Program of the Department of
              Biology, Chemistry and Enviromnental Science is impacting the entire four-year
              biology curriculum at Christopher Newport University (CNU). Research-based
              experimental systems (RBES) developed by Research Link 2000 are forming the
              backbone of this transformation, providing fast-growing plants and biologically
              informative animals with which the concepts learned in lecture can be explored
              in an engaging, investigative, open-ended format. The sea anemone and Wisconsin
              Fast Plant RBES are the initial systems that will be introduced. Additional
              RBES are being investigated and incorporated as an ongoing aspect of the
              project. The transformation begins with the general biology lab course that is
              taken by over 700 majors and nonmajors each year, engaging students in the
              process of science from their first semester. It moves in steps through each
              level in the biology curriculum until courses in all four undergraduate years
              are changed and independent research opportunities are varied and readily
              pursued. Simultaneous with the transformation of the curriculum is the training
              of doctoral candidates who aspire to university careers. These candidates, six
              selected from regional doctoral programs each year and awarded Bartholomew
              Gosnold Instructorships, are being mentored in the use of RBES and guided in
              becoming exciting and productive college faculty. The lessons of Transformation
              2005 are being extended to regional college biology faculty and to local middle
              and high school biology teachers in a series of intensive workshops.
