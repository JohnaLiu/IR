Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

The Department of Biology, Chemistry, and Environmental
              Science is instituting curricular changes over a 3-year period that will
              enhance student learning of local environmental issues through the integration
              of Ion Chromatography (IC) into the undergraduate curriculum. The project is
              impacting more than 400 students per year and is being used in General
              Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Ecology, Instrumental Analysis, Environmental
              Chemistry, and Undergraduate Research within the Department. The goals of this
              project are to:
1) enhance student learning about the local environment
              through field experiences and laboratory exercises using IC;
2) increase
              student understanding of instrumentation selection and sensitivity; and
3)
              allow students to gain experience using currently important
              instrumentation.

The curricular modifications are modeled after successful
              experiences with IC at Calvin College and Western Carolina University.
              Particular experiments are being adapted from the educational and research
              literature and standard EPA protocols and are being implemented to fit our
              curricular requirements.
