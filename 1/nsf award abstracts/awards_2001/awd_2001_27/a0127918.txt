Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project explores the
              feasibility of a novel and inexpensive synthesis, fabrication and processing
              route for creating nanostructures at high rates. The approach specifically
              targets synthesizing synthetic gecko pads. Geckos have the unusual ability to
              adhere to surfaces with a dry nanostructure found on the pads of their feet.
              These nanostructures are so flexible and numerous that stresses on the order of
              one atmosphere result. This permits walking up walls and hanging upside down on
              ceilings. Phase I and Phase II, if successful, will provide adhesive
              manufacturers with synthetic gecko pads. 
     The commercial applications of
              this project include toys, clothing, and shoes, and any application that
              requires a dry, self-cleaning adhesive.
