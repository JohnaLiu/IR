Abstract    :
              In this collaborative project faculty at a number of institutions are working
              together to develop and implement information technological solutions aimed at
              enhancing the interoperability of both collections and services for the NSDL. A
              particular emphasis is on exploring the requirements for supporting "tightly
              federated" collections, that feature close adherence to particular metadata
              frameworks so as to enable federated search services to be built. In this
              collaborative effort a team from the University of California - Berkeley is
              working primarily on collection interoperability while a team from the
              University of Missouri - Columbia is focusing its efforts on enhancing the
              interoperability of services (see DUE 0126690).
