Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)
This project develops a prototype course in
              scientific programming that is aimed at majors in the mathematical sciences (as
              distinct from engineering and computer science) and provides a comprehensive
              introduction to software development tools for large codes in scientific
              computing. The undergraduate computer science curriculum typically includes one
              or more courses in which students work on a large software project, often as
              part of a team, that requires them to develop, document, and respect functional
              interfaces and to compile and link the final product from multiple files and
              libraries. In contrast, majors in mathematics, physics, and similar disciplines
              usually do not learn such skills in the introductory programming and numerical
              analysis courses that typically are part of the curriculum. As a result, majors
              in the mathematical sciences often are at a disadvantage, relative to their
              peers in computer science, when they seek employment after completing their
              baccalaureate degrees or when they continue on to graduate study in fields that
              involve the development of large scientific codes. The course provides
              mathematical science majors with experience in developing and prototyping
              software for applications that involve large data sets or large amounts of CPU
              time.
