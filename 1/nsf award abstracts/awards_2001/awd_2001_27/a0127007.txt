Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21). This project is adapting and implementing a
              web-based homework delivery system, WQS, created at the University of Kentucky
              (UK) under NSF funding (DUE-99542436). First, WQS is being used to deliver
              extensive sets of homework problems in college algebra, first term calculus,
              first term calculus lab, and business calculus. The materials are providing
              assistance for students with weak skills in certain prerequisite topics, as
              well as help on new course topics. Second, the project is adapting a
              problem-solving course developed at UK for prospective high school mathematics
              teachers in which students use the Maple to design web-based problems, posting
              them on the web via WQS. Finally, the PIs are conducting academic year and
              summer workshops for college faculty and current high school teachers to design
              web-based problems and use WQS with their own students. Assessment includes
              multiple student and faculty surveys and comparative studies to determine the
              value of WQS for students in university courses by measuring communication
              between faculty and students, collaboration among students, and improvements in
              student performance.
