Abstract    :
              Engineering - Chemical (53)
Our work is the adaptation of teaching methods
              developed in "Development of an Interdisciplinary Curriculum in Electronic
              Materials and Devices: Cooking Without Recipes" (NSF award # DUE - 9551520).
              Our curriculum has been developed to help undergraduate students who are
              interested in careers as processing engineers in microelectronics and related
              industries. This project helps students develop an in-depth understanding of
              the underlying physical and chemical principles in unit processes commonly used
              in microelectronics. These unit operations include plasma etching, chemical
              vapor deposition, spin coating, and chemical mechanical polishing. In addition
              we are introducing students to advance diagnostics tools which has helped us
              design more advanced microelectronics experiments.

We have also developed a
              curriculum that enables our students to acquire much needed "soft skills".
              These are necessary if our students are to succeed in their professional
              careers. These soft skills include technical writing, oral presentation, safety
              awareness, and teambuilding. We have extended our audience to include high
              school students who have participated in summer programs. Through these summer
              programs we are hoping to recruit underrepresented students into science and
              engineering careers.
