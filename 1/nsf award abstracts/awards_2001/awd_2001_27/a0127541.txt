Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

With funding from an NSF CCLI-EMD grant, we have successfully
              developed a proof-of-concept prototype DVD (digital video disk) for physical
              chemistry. We are now creating a full version of the DVD, with developing 8 new
              modules and updating the 2 modules created for the prototype. The complete
              10-module DVD would be a multimedia program that will allow students in
              undergraduate physical chemistry to see the practical, experimental
              applications of the concepts they are learning in the course. Each module of
              the DVD would explore a scientifically significant research project being
              carried out in a research laboratory in academia or industry, with current and
              relevant applications. The video medium would be used to provide high-quality
              programs about the research that include lecture information by the principal
              scientist and laboratory footage to demonstrate the research in action. The
              video program is supplemented with numerous high-end 3-D animations and
              graphics to assist in teaching the concepts. In addition, a unique Web
              interface to the DVD allow us to include HTML documents containing background
              theory and interactive problems for the students. These problems are based on
              the actual research being carried out, including authentic data from those
              experiments for the physical chemistry students to analyze. This Web-DVD
              interface is the first of its kind for an educational application, and would
              serve students with different learning styles by providing a combination of
              approaches for learning the material.
