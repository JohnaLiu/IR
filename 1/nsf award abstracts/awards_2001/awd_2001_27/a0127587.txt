Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
This project is fully integrating quantitative methods
              into a course in vertebrate microanatomy by adapting digital technology into
              the classroom. While digital imaging technology is now widely available, using
              it effectively in undergraduate courses is limited by a lack of readily
              available protocols, lab materials, and lab exercises for undergraduate
              microscopy. In addition, software instruction to groups is usually done in
              computer labs distant from the biology laboratory. To address these problems,
              we are 1) developing a laboratory manual with special emphasis on image
              processing and quantitative methods for microscopy, 2) creating biologically
              meaningful investigations that apply the protocols, and from which students are
              collecting digital light and electron micrographs, 3) using the images students
              generate as well as commercially available datasets to teach image processing
              and quantitative analysis using readily available software (Adobe Photoshop and
              IPTK plugins), and 4) teaching image processing and analysis using wireless
              networked iBook computers at the benches in biology laboratories. By the end of
              the course, students should be able to prepare vertebrate tissues for light and
              electron microscopy, capture digital images, identify and describe
              characteristic tissue structures and make quantitative comparisons between
              samples.
