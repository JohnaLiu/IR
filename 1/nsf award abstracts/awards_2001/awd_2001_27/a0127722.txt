Abstract    :
              This award continues NSF support for the American Statistical Association's
              Federal Statistics Fellowship Program.  The program also is supported by the
              U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the National Center for
              Education Statistics.  The general objective of the program is to foster
              collaborative and interdisciplinary research efforts that will continue to
              stimulate the development and advancement of methodology and social science
              research relevant to issues on which Federal statistical agencies seek to
              provide information.  The program accomplishes this by bringing academic
              researchers into the supporting federal statistical agencies to work with
              agency statisticians and social scientists for up to one year on problems of
              mutual interest.

Several specific objectives of this research fellowship
              program include: to provide academic scholars with the unique opportunity to
              have "hands on" access to federal agency data through the establishment of
              research fellowships that bring scientists with diverse academic backgrounds to
              the agencies; to bring about an improvement of the quality of the data
              collected and disseminated by each agency; to develop a research group of
              personnel for the future recruitment of statisticians and other research
              scientists to help fill government needs; to stimulate methodological and
              substantive research in academia on the problems of collecting and analyzing
              data that provide the basic information for making decisions that can have
              significant effects on society; and to increase the interaction and
              collaborative research and education among federal agencies and between federal
              agencies and academic institutions.
