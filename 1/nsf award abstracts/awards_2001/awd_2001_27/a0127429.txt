Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59)
Aerosol science and engineering (ASE) has
              "applications in several fields ranging from environmental engineering, public
              health, medical sciences, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, and
              materials science". The National Science and Technology Council lists ASE as
              one of the "Inherently Interdisciplinary" areas. ASE is also linked to the
              National Nanotechnology Initiative. However, teaching of the subject matter has
              been primarily restricted to graduate level resulting in shortage of
              professionals in this field. To ensure further development in this area and to
              explore its true potential, it is essential that the subject be introduced in a
              broader manner at undergraduate level. 

The objective of the project is to
              develop integrated and interactive aerosol dynamics computer programs to
              enhance the understanding of aerosol science and engineering (ASE). To achieve
              this objective, three stand alone modules are going to be developed to be
              included in courses that cover aerosol topics, i.e. ENV 4121 Air Pollution
              Control Design, ChE 368 Transport Phenomena, and the dual level course ENV 518
              Aerosol Science and Engineering. These modules are going to consist of (1)
              Cyclone for particulate control, (2) Optical Particle Counter for particle size
              characterization, and (3) Respiratory Deposition. 

CD-ROMs are going to be
              prepared and disseminated utilizing the network of American Association for
              Aerosol Research (AAAR). Formative and summative evaluations are going to be
              conducted in addition to the pilot evaluations in several aerosol related
              undergraduate classes. Full development is going to be designed based on the
              feedback obtained from the current project.
