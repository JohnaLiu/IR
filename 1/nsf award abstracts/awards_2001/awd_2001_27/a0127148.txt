Abstract    :
              Computer Engineering (32)
We are adapting testing quidelines and techniques
              from a variety of federal and industrial sources and implementing a course in
              testing embedded systems and software. We are working with partners from DoD,
              NASA, and industry to focus on those techniques commonly used in industrial
              environments. Students learn both the theoretical and practical aspects of
              testing embedded systems through case studies obtained from these partners and
              laboratory experiments.
