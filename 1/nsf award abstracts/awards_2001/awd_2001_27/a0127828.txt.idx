Abstract    :
              The Department of Biological Science at California State University Fullerton
              (CSUF) is implementing a major curricular revision of the biology major's
              program in fall 2002. Planning for this revision involved the majority of the
              24 faculty in the department working as collaborative teams and was based on
              explicit identification of student learning outcomes for the entire curriculum
              and for each of the four new core courses that replace the eight core courses
              previously offered. Faculty worked in groups called Teaching Collaboratives,
              according to their expertise, to develop the four new core courses. The new
              core courses incorporate active learning and inquiry-based activities in both
              the lecture and laboratory sections. The Faculty Collaboratives are now
              developing and adapting assessment instruments and techniques (such as those
              developed at Kean University, Reid, B et al, 1992, "Outcome Assessment as a
              Context for Evaluating the Biology Curriculum", BioScience, 42:536-542) for
              critical thinking and problem-solving skills, linked to the major concepts and
              themes within the courses. Faculty teaching the same core courses (members of
              the Teaching Collaboratives) are sharing their assessment items and developing
              new ones with the guidance of assessment software and in collaboration with an
              assessment consultant and process facilitator. In addition, sample student work
              resulting from these assessment items are being examined by the Teaching
              Collaboratives to identify strengths and weaknesses of the assessment items and
              of the learning environment. The end result is development of: an informed
              faculty; an electronic system for gathering the data to monitor the impact of
              curricular changes on student achievement, attitudes, and retention; and an
              accessible but secure database that allows faculty to share assessment items
              and to monitor student profiles throughout the biology program.
