Abstract    :
              Web-based three-tier diagnostic tests to assess misconceptions held by
              undergraduate biology students are being developed. Misconceptions hinder
              students' understanding of complex, abstract scientific concepts, yet many
              faculty and students themselves are unaware of these misconceptions. This
              project is producing a web-based assessment tool for general biology courses to
              provide rapid diagnosis and individualize feedback, which can be easily
              adaptable for other institutions. As a result, science education is being
              improved in two ways. Identification of misconceptions is the first step in
              evoking conceptual change. Diagnosing misconceptions is critical in helping
              students develop more scientifically accurate conceptual understanding, which
              ultimately improves performance in undergraduate science courses and reduces
              attrition. Second, results from this diagnostic instrument help faculty to
              recognize the types of misconceptions that students hold, thereby helping
              faculty to tailor instruction and laboratory activities to confront the
              misconceptions. Assessment results are driving curricular change.
