Abstract    :
              Engineering - Electrical (55)
Instructional materials that fit undergraduate
              classroom teaching and laboratory experiments for the subject of web-based
              Instrumentation and Control (WIC) are scarce. The literature has a few examples
              of previous efforts to build virtual web-based laboratories, but most of these
              are very specialized and the support software is very expensive. It is the goal
              of this proof-of-concept project to offer an undergraduate course with a
              companion laboratory that teaches students to design and develop web tools for
              WIC. The idea is a result ot the research the PI conducted for Siemens and
              Motorola.

The objectives of the project are to demonstrate that (a) it is
              practical and feasible to offer engineering undergraduate students a course on
              WIC that involves recent technological innovations; (b) the proposed course can
              be effectively conducted with two integrated components--classrom lectures and
              hands-on practices through a remote setting; and (c) the course materials can
              also be offered after modification to gifted high school students and thus be
              used as a vehicle to attract students to the engineering disciplines.

The
              plan is to reinforce the process by regularly evaluating the project progress
              based on gathered data and information, and disseminating the project findings
              through conference presentations, scholarly publications, preparation of a
              textbook based on the lecture notes and laboratory materials.
