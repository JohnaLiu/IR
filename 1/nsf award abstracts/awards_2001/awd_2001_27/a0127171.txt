Abstract    :
              Information Science and Systems (33)
This project addresses the need for access
              to educational opportunities enabling anyone to become fluent in information
              technology as defined by the 1999 National Research Council's report "Being
              Fluent with Information Technology" which defined what Skills, Concepts, and
              Capabilities everyone should possess for work, citizenship and personal
              benefit. 

This project is creating BeneFIT100, a free, online self-study
              version for independent learners, based upon the fluency course first developed
              at the University of Washington in 1999. Developed with high production values,
              the course includes all the labs and projects of the successful classroom
              version. To reach students not sophisticated enough for a self-study approach,
              we also offer an instructor-mediated version of BeneFIT100. We address the need
              for a Fluency instructor corps by using BeneFIT100 and a specialized workshop
              to train a nationally selected cohort of future Fluency instructors. Thus, the
              project creates a new, unique resource of international importance, and
              demonstrates leveraging it for teacher training.
