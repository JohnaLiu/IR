Abstract    :
              Engineering - Civil (54)
We have identified a need for failure awareness in the
              undergraduate engineering curriculum. Engineers can learn a lot from failures,
              and failures play an essential role in engineering design. This need has been
              documented in a number of papers and conferences over the past 15 years. Our
              work is in response to this situation and aimed at providing a heightened
              appreciation of the role failure analysis knowledge can play in higher
              education and public safety.

We have produced educational materials on
              failure case studies for use in civil engineering and engineering mechanics
              courses, in print and CD-ROM format. In addition we have developed a one-day
              workshop to disseminate these materials to 24 engineering faculty members from
              across the U.S. During the course of our project we have developed our
              educational materials, including review and feedback by the committees
              discussed below, and the workshop, as well as a thorough evaluation of both
              efforts. Although the majority of the work has been carried out at The
              University of Alabama at Birmingham, faculty members and practicing engineers
              from across the country have participate in the development of these materials
              and the workshop. This work has been accomplished through the various
              committees of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Technical Council
              on Forensic Engineering (TCFE). Our work has specifically targets the NSF
              Division of Undergraduate Education crosscutting theme of Faculty
              Development.
