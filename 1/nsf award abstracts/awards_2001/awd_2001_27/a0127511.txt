Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59) 
This project develops a prototype package of
              educational materials to facilitate the adoption of Problem-Based Learning
              (PBL) into sophomore-level mechanics courses. The objective of this project is
              to create PBL-based materials sufficient to cover those topics in an
              undergraduate dynamics course typically covered in one semester. These new
              materials are going to include (i) the relevant sections of a dynamics
              textbook, and (ii) enough homework and example problems, with emphasis on
              motion over intervals of space and time, to get through a semester. A subset of
              these materials is going to be tested in the fall of 2002 on a limited basis,
              in concert with the textbook that is currently being used. In the spring of
              2003, at least one section of undergraduate dynamics is going to be taught
              using the newly created materials instead of a currently available textbook.
              Baseline and full assessments are going to be done during the spring 2002
              semester and during the 2002-2003 academic year. In addition, through an
              agreement with McGraw-Hill, the materials are going to be reviewed by the
              mechanics faculty at 10-15 universities. At the end of the project period, the
              first draft of the textbook is going to be prepared. Upon the completion of
              this project, a proposal to complete the development of the full package,
              including substantial web- and team-based components is going to be submitted.
