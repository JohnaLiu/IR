Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21). This project is developing an online mentoring guide
              (OMG) to enable professors to integrate mentoring experiences into their
              mathematics and mathematics education courses. Pre-service teachers in these
              courses participate in mentoring activities associated with the Math Forum's
              "Problems of the Week" feature, a web-based project in which students in grades
              3-12 submit solutions to six different posted problems. These "apprentice"
              mentors respond to each student and engage them in mathematical discourse. The
              OMG also allows individuals to pursue mentoring for continuing education credit
              or simply for professional growth. Incorporating the OMG in a variety of
              math-oriented classes is expected to encourage more students to consider
              teaching as a profession. Assessment of the impact of the mentoring experience
              on the student participants' understanding of mathematics teaching issues and
              children's learning of mathematics is being undertaken through focus groups,
              pre- and post-interviews, video conferencing, and Internet-based
              communications. Participating faculty at nine institutions are piloting
              versions of the OMG and providing feedback, from both themselves and their
              students, to improve the Guide, the Math Forum's existing mentoring
              environment, and the capacity to mentor more students.
