Abstract    :
              Engineering - Electrical (55)

The project is adapting and implementing a pair
              of laboratory courses to teach the microfabrication techniques required to
              create microdevices. Materials and instrumentation for microfabrication
              techniques are being procured and constructed in a laboratory, and process
              sequences are being adapted from similar programs and implemented in the
              laboratory. Using these facilities and techniques, students are making
              transistors and simple MEMS devices. Assessment involves student course
              evaluations and peer review where faculty, industrial and government
              representatives interested in microfabrication examine the course content,
              student work, and student course evaluations. Dissemination plans include
              reporting results in journal and conference publications and on a web site and
              developing an Internet-based course on microfarication.
