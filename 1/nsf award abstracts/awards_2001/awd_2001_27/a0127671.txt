Abstract    :
              The PIs will investigate the influence of the solar cycle on the general
              circulation of the stratosphere and troposphere. Decadal variations operating
              coherently with the variation of the ultra-violet (UV) radiation will be
              investigated in long records of dynamical and chemical structure characterizing
              the circulations of the stratosphere and troposphere. Building on recent
              evidence, this investigation will examine the four-dimensional record of
              National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalyses to isolate
              those months and locations, inclusive of the Southern Hemisphere, tropics and
              troposphere, for which interannual changes operate dependently with changes of
              ultra-violet (UV) irradiance. Contemporaneous changes of ozone will be
              investigated in records from station data and in the satellite record from
              total ozone mapping spectrometer instrument (TOMS). The work is important
              because it will enhance our understanding of solar-climate interactions.
