Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

Loyola University of Chicago is integrating three laboratory
              experiments that are utilizing GC/MS as the principal component into the
              undergraduate analytical laboratory curriculum. Chemistry majors in the
              Quantitative Analysis course are using electron capture ionization (ECI) in
              conjunction with GC/MS to quantify a model aromatic amine, aniline, at the
              femtogram/picogram level. Undergraduates in the newly-established Environmental
              Chemistry course are analyzing low levels of chlorinated phenols in
              water
samples. Students in the Instrumental Analysis laboratory are comparing
              a GC/MS-based method for the determination of lead to inductively-coupled
              plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry and other analytical methods. 

The
              experiments have been adapted and implemented from the research and educational
              literature and are emphasizing the development of skills associated with
              handling and extracting small quantities of analyte. Analytical chemistry
              students are becoming acquainted with the power of GC/MS to detect and quantify
              very small (femtogram level) amounts of analyte, particularly through the use
              of electron capture as the ionization technique for GC/MS. Once the students
              are familiar with the GC/MS, they are applying their knowledge to the analysis
              of real-world samples, including water from Lake Michigan and paint chips from
              housing projects in the Chicago area.
