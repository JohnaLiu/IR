Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)
This project is creating a set of laboratory exercises
              that support student understanding of robust software systems design for modern
              electronic commerce applications. Lecture and lab are closely synchronized so
              that technical topics, strategies, and case studies presented in lecture are
              immediately reinforced by an implementation experience in the laboratory. Lab
              exercises include protocol performance, cryptography, authentication,
              electronic transactions, and steaming multimedia using technologies such as
              Java, ASP, Perl, XML and MySQL.

There is particular emphasis on the planning
              and evaluation process to ensure that the materials are those most necessary
              and sufficient for student understanding of electronic commerce.
