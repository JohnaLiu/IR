Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
The Living Textbook Initiative (LTI) of the Johns
              Hopkins University has designed a new form of textbook to address specific
              educational challenges: How can textbooks become more effective at delivering
              the best science to more students? How can different learning
              styles--listening, reading, seeing, and interacting--be integrated into a
              textbook? How can such a text support teachers' efforts to expand their role as
              mentors and discussion leaders? The LTI is producing, evaluating, and
              publishing Human Physiology: The Cardiovascular System, in a CD/Internet-based
              textbook. This publication will comprise 10 chapters, each composed of a
              virtual lecture, a full lecture-length animation of scientific concepts, note
              taking capabilities, and interactive laboratory simulations. A web site
              provides tutorials, posting capabilities, and discussion boards. A prototype
              textbook has been tested and proven effective. LTI content and technology
              experts represent the Johns Hopkins University's Department of Biomedical
              Engineering and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Beta-test site schools
              representing a diversity of students are testing and evaluating the Living
              Textbook. McGraw-Hill Publishing is part of the beta study and is focusing on
              issues related to marketing and distribution. A project report will be
              submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal to culminate the project.
