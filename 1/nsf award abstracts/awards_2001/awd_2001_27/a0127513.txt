Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding to conduct a workshop to focus on tether-free
              technologies in manufacturing.  The focus of the workshop is to address
              underlying issues in emerging tether-free technologies and their applications
              in manufacturing equipment, processes, and enterprise system, and ultimately
              provide better direction for researchers and practitioners.  It is hoped the
              results of this workshop can impact both manufacturing research and education
              activities in academia. The potential areas that would benefit, if embedded
              within a tether-free environment include, but are not limited to: manufacturing
              (wire free sensor/actuator systems for closed loop feedback systems, enhance
              quality control and preventative maintenance of equipment, the remotely
              controlled factory floor); wireless sensors and/or actuators for environmental
              sensing and control; smart defense systems in mobile power, command & control
              on the move); smart materials and structures for closed-loop monitoring and
              control; new tether-free infrastructure (ultra-wideband techniques, data
              compression, security of sensitive data/information, etc). 

The project is
              to organize a collaborative workshop among industry, academia, and government
              agencies to discuss the needs and emerging technologies, as well as to make
              recommendations to the National Science Foundation and the research community
              on the direction of interdisciplinary research and education in the areas of
              tether-free technologies and their impacts to e-manufacturing.  The results of
              the workshop will be used to define industry/university collaborative needs as
              well as to serve as an potential roadmap for researchers and practitioners to
              advance the state-of-the-art technologies and practices in applying tether-free
              technologies in next-generation manufacturing equipment, processes, and
              enterprise systems for U.S. manufacturing industry.
