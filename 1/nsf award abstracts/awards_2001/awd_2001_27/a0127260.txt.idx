Abstract    :
              Tendon is a dense, fibrous tissue that connects muscle to bone. It plays a host
              of biomechanical roles, is architecturally complex, and virtually impossible to
              repair if damaged. This symposium will address a fundamental shortcoming of
              current research into the biology of tendon. Organismic biologists have little
              or no appreciation for clinical, developmental, or molecular aspects of tendon
              biology, while biomedical researchers are largely unaware of the comparative
              physiology, evolutionary patterns, and diverse roles of tendon in vertebrates.
              The goal of the symposium is to bring together researchers from a variety of
              applied and basic research areas to synthesize the current state of our
              knowledge of tendon. Participants will also point out new and innovative
              directions for future research. Speakers will cover a broad range of scale,
              from the molecular biology of tendon organization, through patterning at the
              cellular level, and tissue interactions with muscle and bone, to the many roles
              of tendon in the whole organism. In addition to serving as the basis for the
              first volume ever devoted to the biology of tendon, this symposium will foster
              a synergy between tendon researchers in such wide-ranging fields as molecular
              developmental biology, biochemistry, functional morphology, and biomedicine.
