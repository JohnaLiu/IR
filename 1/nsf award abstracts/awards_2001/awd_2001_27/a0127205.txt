Abstract    :
              Faculty at Wright State University and Miami University are conducting
              complementary activities for the purpose of introducing and training students
              and educators to the precepts and techniques of combinatorial chemistry. The
              primary focus of the project is laboratory instruction in this area. Activities
              include testing, adapting and documenting experiments already developed at the
              collaborating institutions as well as developing additional exercises
              appropriate for students at all levels of undergraduate training. The materials
              take into consideration variations in equipment inventory and faculty expertise
              at institutions serving as adaptation sites. The utility of these experiments
              as an educational contribution to the training of chemical technicians is also
              being explored. Experiments range from solid phase variants of traditional
              experiments to discovery-based activities requiring group work and several
              weeks of project-style input. Anticipated dissemination activities include
              publication and presentation of papers at professional conferences, the
              development of sourcebooks and workshops for educators, dedicated conferences
              and collaboration on an introductory laboratory manual.
