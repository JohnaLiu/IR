Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              magnetorheological (MR) fluids using nano-sized magnetic particles. MR fluids
              are a family of smart materials that have the unique ability to undergo rapid,
              reversible, and significant changes in their rheological properties on
              application of an external magnetic field. These unique properties make MR
              fluids very attractive for such applications as shock and vibration control,
              brakes, and precision finishing technology. However, problems persist with
              commercial MR fluids due to the relatively large magnetic particles used
              (typically 3-5 um). These problems include poor stability against sedimentation
              and redispersibility. In this Phase I project, nanosized magnetic powders will
              be developed to produce MR fluids with improved stability and redispersibility.
              This will be followed by optimization of synthesis, characterization, and
              testing of the MR fluids. 

The commercial applications of this project are
              expected to include electrically controllable dampers, brakes, clutches, engine
              mounts, throttle valves, cross steppers and precision finishing technology.
