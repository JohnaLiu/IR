Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59)

This project, being conducted by a team of
              researchers from the University of Pittsburgh and the Colorado School of Mines,
              investigates the feasibility of a web-based system for assessing an engineering
              student's ability to recognize and resolve ethical dilemmas similar to those
              encountered in practice. The investigators are testing a "pencil-and-paper"
              version with carefully constructed scenarios and well developed scoring rubrics
              on 100 students. Finally, they are evaluating the use of a neural network to
              predict student classification. In order to evaluate their tool, they will
              compare their results to those derived from follow-up interviews and a
              "triangulation" process that combines many measures to estimate the true
              outcome. They plan to describe their results at major engineering education
              meetings and, if warranted, they will publish in archived journals.
