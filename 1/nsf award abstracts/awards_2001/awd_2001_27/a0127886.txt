Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will study the
              feasibility of an innovative new process for the production of hot rolled
              titanium alloy sheet. Hot rolled titanium alloy is currently manufactured using
              facilities designed to produce other materials, such as stainless steels. As a
              consequence, it is common for the production of hot rolled titanium alloy sheet
              to require several months of processing, with a material yield of less than
              one-half. In the proposed research, equipment specifically designed for the
              production of titanium sheet will be developed and implemented to streamline
              production. In conjunction with equipment improvements, cutting-edge processing
              technology and innovative ideas will be incorporated to yield the following
              benefits over traditional titanium alloy sheet production processes: 1)
              significant reduction in the number of manufacturing steps required; 2)
              improvement in the quality and mechanical properties; and 3) substantial
              reduction in the yield loss, production time, and final cost. 

The
              commercial benefits of this new process will make hot rolled titanium alloy
              sheet more competitive with other metals on a cost basis. Ultimately, it is
              believed that the proposed process will lead to an increase in the market share
              and number of products that can economically incorporate titanium alloy
              sheet.
