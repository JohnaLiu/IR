NSF/USDOT: Real-time collision Warning at Traffic
              Intersections

Collisions between vehicles at urban and rural intersections
              account for nearly a third of all reported crashes in the United States. This
              research entails developing some of the components of a real-time system which
              uses cameras to continuously gather traffic data at intersections (e.g.,
              vehicle speeds, positions, trajectories, accelerations/decelerations, vehicle
              sizes, signal status, etc.), applies efficient algorithmic techniques to detect
              potential collisions and near-misses, and then issues suitable countermeasures.
              At this stage, the goal is to establish the feasibility of this approach using
              both computer simulations and field tests at actual intersections (urban
              intersections in the Twin Cities---Minneapolis and St. Paul, MN). The proposed
              work has as main emphasis the design of efficient and robust computer vision
              and collision-detection algorithms that can address the intersection collision
              warning problem.
