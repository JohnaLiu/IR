Abstract    :
              The investigators will determine the impact of adverse space weather conditions
              on the electricity market. The main effort is to by formulate an econometric
              model of electricity supply in which space weather conditions, because they
              impact the transmission of electricity, are a variable. The work addresses the
              economic consequences of space weather events. While some of the economic
              impacts are fabled within the space weather community (e.g. Quebec Hydro in
              1989), to date no one has systematically documented and quantified the true
              economic costs. The research proposed here will begin to rectify that
              shortcoming. The fundamental reason why space weather may adversely impact the
              performance of the power grid is because adverse space weather conditions can
              interfere with the transmission of electric power. Specifically, the power
              transmission grid can act as an "antenna" of sorts, picking up
              geomagnetically-induced currents (GIC) at distances of hundreds of kilometers.
              The GIC are the result of electric currents high in the atmosphere of Earth (at
              ionospheric altitudes), produced by geomagnetic storms and sub-storms as the
              magnetosphere interacts with disturbances in the solar wind.
