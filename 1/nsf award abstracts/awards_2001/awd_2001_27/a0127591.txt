Abstract    :
              Engineering - Materials Science (57)
In order to solve simple as well as
              involved materials science problems the use of spreadsheet solutions has been
              underutilized by educators. We have developed a suite of problems in materials
              science that lend themselves to spreadsheet solutions. Our materials enable
              students to work on the collection of data, graphing techniques, and analysis
              of may problem types. Toward this end a workbook containing a complete set of
              tutorials, applications, problem solutions, and a study guide has been created.
              In addition an instructor's manual is also available. These materials have been
              designed for use in high schools and colleges. We are disseminating our
              materials through symposia and publications. We are also distributing our
              materials through a publisher as well as the Internet.
