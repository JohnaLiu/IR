Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)
This project develops and creates a comprehensive
              computer lab manual, which is designed for use in an undergraduate abstract
              algebra class. The manual consists of a collection of group projects and
              student exercises that help illuminate and illustrate abstract algebra
              concepts. In addition, this manual includes exposition providing a context for
              the exercises and coherence. Many of the computer projects are designed to lead
              the student to specific conjectures about the structure of a group, ring, or
              field. The exercises and projects also provide the students and instructor with
              a rich source of examples. The computer is used to eliminate some of the need
              for computation by hand and allow the students to investigate larger and more
              elaborate examples. The manual engages students in an active learning
              environment by providing group projects and interaction with technology. An
              initial web site appeared in August of 2001. Current teaching resources, which
              integrate technology into upper division mathematics courses, are relatively
              limited. This manual provides such a resource for the area of abstract algebra.
