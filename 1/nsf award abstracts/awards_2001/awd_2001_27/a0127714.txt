Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project is to design and develop
              appropriate mathematical models and algorithms for optimizing the crosscut
              operation in a wood processing (lumber processing) rough mill. The goal is to
              incorporate these algorithms into an integrated software system for automatic
              control of the process. The software system consists of a main engine that
              contains the mathematical models and algorithms for finding an optimal cutting
              pattern for each piece of incoming uncut lumber, along with all necessary
              mechanisms to interface with (and to coordinate the operation of) various
              components of the manufacturing line. These components include automatic
              scanners, automatic crosscut saws, and all associated conveyor belts and
              positioning devices. At the present time in most rough mills the task of
              identifying a good cutting pattern for each piece of lumber is done by visual
              inspection. 

The commercial benefits of this software system wil be on the
              efficiency of the crosscut operation, by increasing both its speed and its
              yield. This could lead to substantial reductions in the manufacturing cost as
              well as significant savings in the overall consumption of wood, which is a
              scarce national resource.
