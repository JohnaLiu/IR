Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)

The main goal of this project is to improve the quality
              of the software design and development education for undergraduate students in
              Syracuse University, with contributions to the understanding of the educational
              process that will have similar benefits to other educational institutions in
              the country. 

This is accomplished by adapting and integrating the results
              of the NSF Educational Innovations project at the University of Alabama on
              integrating component-based software development into the computing curriculum
              (NSF CDA-9712929). 

The major adaptation efforts focuses on introducing
              component-based software development into the courses on software engineering,
              rather than requiring separate courses.
