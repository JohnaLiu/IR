Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
This project continues an NSF-funded project to teach
              undergraduate neurobiology through interactive simulations that mimic the
              experience of doing actual experiments in a real wet lab. Our first effort
              produced a software framework that allows students to learn basic concepts by
              doing simulated experiments in an active exploratory way, and a small set of
              interactive laboratories that exercise this framework through explorations of,
              e.g. resting potentials, action potentials and simple neuromodulation. Here, we
              are undertaking major new efforts which exploit our existing software framework
              to: 1) teach students quantitative and analytical skills and methods in the
              context of data analysis and experimental design; 2) make our software and labs
              broadly available to students from a wide variety of backgrounds and
              educational environments (including non-traditional learners) through a series
              of interactive tutorials covering fundamental concepts and the use of our
              software; and 3) develop new computer-based tools for the objective assessment
              and graded testing of student learning. The result will be a second version of
              our software, incorporating major new tools for experimental design, data
              analysis, and testing/assessment of student learning, together with a
              collection of 30 fully tested interactive laboratories covering most or all
of
              the core concepts in cellular neurobiology.
