Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will integrate materials
              processing and will develop a new lightweight and resilient three-dimensional
              woven fiber reinforced cellular matrix composite (3DCMC) material.  Lightweight
              materials will allow fuel efficient and more environmentally friendly vehicles.
               The 3DCMC have the potential to significantly surpass the strength, stiffness,
              damage tolerance, energy absorption, and characteristics of current composite
              materials. Predictive analysis for a detailed characterization and optimization
              will be performed.

The commercial potential of this project will be a new
              class of lightweight 3-D woven composites with cellular matrix; this will
              benefit the automotive industry.
