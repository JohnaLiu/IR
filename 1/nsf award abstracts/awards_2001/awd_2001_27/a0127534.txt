Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)
This project is developing a more effective way of
              teaching the high dropout introductory
programming course by using a set of
              group-based cooperative learning exercises in 
conjunction with the lecture
              approach. A major goal is to maximize use of faculty 
resources by
              incorporating teaching assistants into the process.

Cooperative learning is
              a well known pedagogy for improving student retention and success. However, it
              is relatively unused in computer science and this project will provide an
              instructor's manual and group exercises to help computer science faculty move
              towards using cooperative learning.
