The objective of this research is to investigate the growth
              dynamics of the green alga Selenastrum capricornutum and the blue-green alga
              Synechococcus leopoliensis in a well-defined flow system.  This research will
              test the hypothesis that the growth and aggregate formation of these algae
              depends not only on optimal water temperature, light regime, and nutrients, but
              also on hydrodynamic mixing conditions.  To test this hypothesis, experimental
              studies of these algae will be conducted under laminar, turbulent, and
              turbulent-intermittent fluid flow conditions in order to characterize the
              growth, aggregate formation and morphometry as functions of intrinsic fluid
              flow parameters.  Fluid flow conditions will be generated using both a rotating
              cylinder apparatus and an oscillating grid apparatus.  This research could
              provide data for improved model development for the prediction of alga blooms
              in freshwater systems.
