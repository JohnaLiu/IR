Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21). This project is developing an expanded set of
              features and functionality of a mathematical visualization program,
              3D-Filmstrip. Project tasks include writing appropriate documentation, not only
              for the software itself but more importantly for the mathematical objects it is
              used to visualize; improving the scriptability of the program, both to enhance
              its ability to communicate with other running programs (e.g., web-servers,
              database programs, etc.) and also to facilitate the automation of its use as a
              curriculum supplement; producing additional format interchange software, so
              that objects created using 3D-Filmstrip can be further processed and viewed in
              other programs (e.g., Mathematica, Maple, VRML) and vice versa; and improving
              the cross-platform features of the program, in particular making more of its
              features available over the Web. Several pilot integrations of the program into
              the mathematical sciences curriculum are taking place at various educational
              levels. This work is also informing the writing of two sets of undergraduate
              level "Lecture Notes" tightly coupled to 3D-Filmstrip, one on the theory of
              curves and surfaces, and the second on lattice models.
