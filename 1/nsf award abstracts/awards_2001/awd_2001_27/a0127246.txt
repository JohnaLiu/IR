Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99)
This project takes the innovative and highly successful
              interdisciplinary science education Web portal Visionlearning
              (http://www.visionlearning.com) from prototype to full implementation.
              Visionlearning has been proven through classroom evaluation to provide
              effective learning strategies for students and it has received outstanding peer
              reviews that have praised its effective use of creative and timely teaching
              methods. The Visionlearning portal efficiently leverages the inherent strengths
              of the Internet to make interdisciplinary teaching materials freely available
              to all students and instructors. Visionlearning has successfully integrated
              strategies to specifically benefit low income and minority science students.
              

This project is:
a) adding 72 new lessons to Our Library, a group of novel
              teaching modules proven to enhance learning;
b) fully developing MyClassroom,
              an imaginative system that allows faculty to fully customize the Visionlearning
              interface to their own curricular objectives;
c) enhancing the Teaching &
              Technology area, a valuable clearinghouse for faculty development;
d)
              expanding the robust evaluation of the project to three additional diverse
              institutions;
e) further disseminating the project to add at least 20
              instructors to the Visionlearning faculty list; and
f) broadening the
              publishing partnership to ensure the project's long-term sustainability.
