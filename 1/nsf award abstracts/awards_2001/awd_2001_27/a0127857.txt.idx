Abstract    :
              EIA-0127857 Mary K. Vernon University of Wisconsin  The goal of this project
              is to develop the tools needed for performance-directed integrated design and
              control of complex applications running on distributed computational systems. 
              Its target computational systems are complex, incorporating the difficult
              heterogeneity, latency, and adaptive properties of computational grids.  Its
              target applications are at the cutting edge of computational science: very
              large, complex applications with adaptive characteristics that do not allow
              their optimal system configurations or computational requirements to be
              estimated prior to run time.  Each application will be viewed as a composition
              of components, with a formal, high fidelity model of performance to be designed
              for each component.  The approach is to use model-based adaptive run-time
              control, based on these composed performance models, to control the execution
              of the application to meet specified performance goals.  The control strategy
              will make real-time changes to parameters that modify the behavior of both
              application and computational platform.
