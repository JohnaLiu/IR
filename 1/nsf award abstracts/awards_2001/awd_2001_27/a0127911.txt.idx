              ABSTRACT   Proposal: CMS-0127911 PI: Christopher L. DeMarco Institution:
              University of Wisconsin-Madison Date: July 21, 2001   As our nation's needs
              in critical infrastructure have been examined in the wake of Presidential
              Decision Directive 63, a number of forums have identified enhancement of U.S.
              university programs to prepare suitably trained researchers and technical
              professionals as a key area for further effort. Graduate training and research
              experience relevant to critical infrastructures has a strong interdisciplinary
              component. Accomplishing interdisciplinary work in the traditionally
              specialized departmental structure of graduate programs at the U.S.
              universities has long presented a challenge. The goal of this workshop is to
              present perspectives from a disparate set of disciplines on critical
              infrastructures, share experiences of interdisciplinary research and graduate
              education, and identify and disseminate mechanisms to further cultivate and
              improve this work to include the programs of NSF and other agencies which
              provide support for these efforts.
