Abstract    :
              Software Engineering (34)

Defective, or "bug-riddled," software is a serious
              problem in the software industry, costing U.S. companies as much as $100
              billion last year. Software testing is a critical tool for addressing this
              issue, but unfortunately, it is viewed as boring and uncreative by
              practitioners and receives little formal treatment in undergraduate programs.
              

The objective of this project is to develop a series of on-line education
              modules covering software testing that will be integrated at several levels
              across the undergraduate computer science curriculum.

Module content will
              allow the instructor to adjust the coverage assigned to students, and assign
              module content in parallel with ongoing class programming assignments. 

The
              result will be an array of services with an easy-to-use web interface, allowing
              students to use the tool in many different classes, allowing instructors to
              incorporate tool-based testing in their own assignments, and supporting use by
              students and educators at multiple institutions. As an integral part of the
              project, summer research interns from Virginia Tech's Minority Academic
              Opportunities Program will participate in both research and educational aspects
              of the proposed work.
