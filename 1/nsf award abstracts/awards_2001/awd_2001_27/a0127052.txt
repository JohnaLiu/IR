Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59)
We have developed a number of real-time experiments as
              an approach to improving student understanding of the graphical representation
              of a variety of concepts. The project builds on successes by Physics educators
              (primarily with motion sensors) in combining the use of technology and hands-on
              engineering experiments to achieve visual analysis of phenomena in real-time in
              the classroom. Our approach has expanded greatly by using a wide variety of
              inexpensive sensors that are easily interfaced with PCs. This enables our
              students to measure many different physical phenomena. We have developed a
              series of modules in one-page, and use a 20-minute activity format. We hope
              this format more readily enable faculty to incorporation our modules into their
              curriculum. Our best modules are being distributed and marketed with the
              assistance of the manufacturer of the sensors. Our modules have been designed
              to be appropriate for high school students. It has been our goal to implement
              our modules across multiple classes. The modules and the format we have created
              holds promise for students to make connections between courses and thus support
              curriculum integration. Students are encouraged to learn more effectively and
              both students and instructors are expected to enjoy the learning process. A
              multiple-intervention assessment protocol will be used to determine the
              comparative benefit to learning effectiveness of the following interventions:
              (1) presentation of concepts with time for reflection, (2) reflection guided by
              instructor demonstrations using the sensors, and (3) guided, active
              experimentation with the sensors. A pre-test / post-test design will be used to
              account for the effect of differences in the initial preparation of the
              different study populations.
