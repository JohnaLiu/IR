Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)
The chemistry department is enhancing student experiences in
              physical chemistry by shifting the laboratory experience towards a more
              research-rich project environment. Students are undertaking projects that make
              use of a laser light scatter instrument, a laser Raman spectrometer, additional
              and computers and software. Expanded projects in quantum chemistry and
              molecular modeling are creating a more comprehensive link between experimental
              data and theoretical constructions. Experiments are being adapted primarily
              from the research literature. Many of these experiments allow students to work
              with macromolecules. The new studies assist students in creating a deeper
              understanding of the correlation between structure and function, enhance their
              skills in experimental design and create a more research-like approach to their
              laboratory studies. This approach is expected to make physical chemistry
              students more aware of the process chemists utilize in exploring the chemical
              world, create greater interest in the course, and provide a stimulus for the
              students to pursue undergraduate research with a physical chemist.
