Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)
This project is developing curricular materials for an
              interdisciplinary digital media program to meet four needs: (1) the high
              interest that college students are showing in digital media, (2) the growing
              demand for digital media professionals, (3) the need for course material that
              addresses both the technical and the aesthetic elements of multimedia creation,
              and (4) the need for a curriculum that balances hands-on experience with
              fundamental concepts that remain constant beyond fast-changing multimedia
              development tools. The primary goal of the project is to develop materials that
              are appropriate to students of either computer science or art, to find the core
              curriculum necessary for both groups of students, and to present this
              interdisciplinary material in a well-integrated, modular approach. 

The
              curricular materials are divided into three modules: (1) a primer that provides
              fundamental knowledge required of all students and that concentrates on
              hands-on exercises; (2) an advanced module that provides the scientific,
              technical, and mathematical foundation for the students understanding of
              digital media; and (3) an advanced module that addresses the aesthetics and
              graphic design issues. The materials cover image processing, digital audio, and
              digital video and are delivered in an electronic format (Web, CD-ROM, and
              e-books) with interactive multimedia enhancements.
