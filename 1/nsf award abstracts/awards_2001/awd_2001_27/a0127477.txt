Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)
Bioinformatics brings together the fields of biology,
              computer science, and information technology to analyze, among other things,
              the gigabytes of genome data that have been collected over the past fifteen
              years. The work that will be done by bioinformaticists in the 21st century will
              dramatically change the practice of medicine much like the discovery of the
              transistor altered the course of information technology in the 20th century.
              The national need for bioinformaticists, estimated by one study to be 20,000 by
              the year 2005, with the education and training to speak the complex languages
              of biology and computer science will not be met by one institution alone.
              

The goal of this project is to develop courseware for general use in
              diverse contexts at other institutions, even those without a degree program in
              Bioinformatics. This project provides a packet of lecture presentations and
              laboratory manuals that can be widely disseminated and used by teams of
              biologists and computer scientists outside of RIT to support instruction in
              Bioinformatics. These instructional materials are being developed by an
              interdisciplinary team of biologists and computer scientists with input from
              academic partners from outside institutions.

This work includes supporting
              material, prepared by computer scientists, written for biologists so that a
              biologist can understand the computational processes being utilized to analyze
              the biological data. Likewise supporting material, prepared by biologists,
              written for computer scientists will be developed so that a computer scientist
              can understand the basic biological processes being analyzed.
