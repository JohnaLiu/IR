Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99)
This project is developing modules within an immersive
              virtual environment (VE) in 
order to examine whether or not such environments
              provide an effective venue for education. 
The environment being developed is
              based upon four principles. First, a high level of 
interactivity is necessary
              to allow students opportunities for active learning. Second, 
VE technology is
              used as a supplement to other methods of learning. Third, the environment
              
contains many types of information and presents links between them. Finally,
              the 3D 
visualization realistically portrays information that is abstract or
              normally not visible in 
the physical world. The modules being developed are
              in structural engineering, computer 
networks, and computer graphics and we
              are integrating them into the curriculum in order to 
evaluate their
              effectiveness. The results of this work include a set of well-tested
              
educational VE applications, guidelines for designing educational VEs, and
              principles for 
deciding when a VE is an appropriate choice for an educational
              goal and it is intended to 
provide a real and substantial improvement to the
              learning environments of many students as 
well as innovative VE research.
