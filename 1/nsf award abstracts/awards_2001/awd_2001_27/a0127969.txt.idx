Abstract    :
              NSF/USDOT: Dynamic and Stochastic Vehicle Dispatching with Time Dependent Travel
              Times: The Next Generation of Algorithms Researchers have long understood that
              stochastic and time-dependent travel times, stochastic service or handling
              times and stochastic demand arrival patterns render schedules developed using
              static assignment models sub-optimal and often infeasible.  Nonetheless, the
              development of alternative models and solution methods has proceeded at a
              relatively slow pace.  The costs associated with these infeasibilities can be
              very high and are borne by commercial vehicle operators, their customers and
              society at large.     This research represents a new generation of routing
              and scheduling models, ones that explicitly incorporate time-dependent and
              stochastic travel times, dynamic service requests and stochastic service times.
               The applications of interest are local truckload trucking operations, local
              less-than-truckload operations, local pickup and delivery operations and
              service fleets.
