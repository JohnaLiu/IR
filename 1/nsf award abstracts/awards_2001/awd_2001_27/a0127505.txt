Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)
This project develops a virtual testbed that allows for
              providing hands-on experience to large numbers of students together with the
              course material for an introductory course on embedded systems programming. The
              key feature is to couple a PC with an embedded processor board and to simulate
              a variety of external electromechanical devices thereby alleviating the need to
              provide expensive, maintenance prone physical devices in large numbers.
              Requests of devices by user programs running on the embedded processor are
              transparently forwarded to the simulators on the PC. Using software instruments
              such as voltmeters and scopes, students experience hands-on programming while
              the institution experiences a low-cost low-maintenance laboratory.

The
              course material being developed applies to an introductory course in embedded
              systems programming and consists of a sequence of modules, each of which is
              centered on a small programming project. All materials are web-based to allow
              for broad dissemination and possible distance learning.
