Abstract    :
              Following A.P. Calderon's program (sketched in his Helsinki ICM 
address in
              1978), many basic boundary value problems in physics 
and engineering can be
              attacked by starting with a representation 
of the solution in the form of a
              potential operator, and then 
reducing matters to analyzing the functional
              analytic properties
of a system of pseudodifferential operators on the
              boundary.
The new phenomenon, occurring when non-smooth structures
              are
present, is that these boundary operators belong to a larger
class, 
              consisting of singular integral operators. The lack of
a symbolic  calculus in
              this context makes the study of such
operators fundamentally harder,
              particularly when one has to
address such delicate issues like Fredholmness
              and invertibility.
While in the intervening years these ideas have undergone
              a
dramatic development, much remains to be done. 

The main goal of the
              current proposal is to investigate the
specific nature of the singular
              integral operators arising in
connection with basic problems in mathematical
              physics, such as
Maxwell's equations, vector Poisson problems,
              Hodge
decompositions, and Stokes's system of hydrodynamics, in light
of
              recent advances in the fields of harmonic analysis and
partial differential
              equations. For maximum applicability, it
is important to consider these
              problems in the context of
general Sobolev-Besov spaces and when the
              underlying 
structures are minimally smooth.
