Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the University of Kansas for a three-year REU
              Site in Biomechanical Engineering under the direction of Dr. Kenneth J.
              Fischer.  The project will involve 10 undergraduate students each year for a
              ten week summer program.  Students will work with a faculty mentor on
              individual research projets in biomechanical engineering.  In addition to
              individual research experiences, students will be involved in several group
              activities.  These activities will provide the student with 1) a breadth of
              exposure to different scientific problems and research approaches, 2) detailed
              information about additional educational career opportunities, 3) an
              environment that facilitates student-student and student-faculty interactions,
              and 4) an opportunity to explore research ethics in the field of biomechanical
              engineering.  These group activities will include a weekly seminar, a research
              ethics mini-series, tours of research laboratories, and social activities.  At
              the end of the summer program students will give an oral presentation at a
              research symposium, and will submit a report on their research project to their
              faculty mentor.  Students will also have the opportunity to attend a national
              scientific meeting of their choice.
