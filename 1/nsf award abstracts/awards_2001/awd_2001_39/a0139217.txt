Abstract    :
              This award will provide funding to the National Institute of Standards and
              Technology (NIST) for a REU Site in electrical engineering and electronics,
              under the direction of Dr. David B. Newell.  The project will involve up to
              nine undergraduate students for a 10-12 week summer program and internationally
              known  NIST research engineers and scientists in individual research projects
              covering topics that include fundamental electrical measurements, national
              electrical standards, electric power systems, flat panel displays, electronic
              data exchange and micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS).
