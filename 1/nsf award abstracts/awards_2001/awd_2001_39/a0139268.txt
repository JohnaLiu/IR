Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
              site that will host a total of fourteen students per summer during twelve weeks
              of summer research. The REU program is based on the theory that mentoring and
              networking are the most effective methods for recruiting students into a
              profession and for training young researchers. Students will be working with
              researchers at one of three estuarine and coastal research sites, including
              Horn Point Laboratory (HPL), Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL) and the
              Academy of Natural Science Estuarine Research Center (ANSERC). Organizers of
              the program have four main goals including, 1) to foster a close student-mentor
              relationship 2) to have students develop and complete a scientific project, 3)
              to have students communicate their scientific findings, 4) to ensure students
              understand ethical issues involved in scientific research. Matching funding is
              provided by the Maryland Seagrant Program (MSGP).
