Abstract    :
              During the summers of 2002-2004 the Department of Biology at Marquette
              University will sponsor a ten-week NSF-REU site program.  Twelve undergraduate
              students, who have completed their sophomore or junior year, will be selected
              to work with individual faculty in the areas of microbiology, molecular and
              cellular biology, developmental biology, neurobiology and vertebrate
              physiology.  The program is designed to provide a hands-on research experience
              that will enhance the students' appreciation of experimental science and
              increase their ability to work independently in a research environment.  This
              program is also intended  to encourage students to pursue careers in science
              and research and to foster the participation of women, members of
              underrepresented minority groups and persons with disabilities.  Each
              participant will help design and carry out a research project during the summer
              and, at the end of the program, prepare a report and present research findings
              at an undergraduate research symposium.  In addition to their research
              activities, students will participate in a variety of program-sponsored
              activities including a journal club, seminars by visiting speakers and
              workshops on contemporary ethical issues in biology and medicine.  The program
              will thus provide its participants with a unique experience that will enhance
              their insight into the scientific process, facilitate their career decisions
              and, ultimately, positively impact their contributions to science and society. 
              Further information on the program and application procedures is available at
              the department website (http://mendel.biol.mu.edu) or by contacting the Program
              Director, Dr. Stephen H. Munroe (telephone 414-288-1485; e-mail
