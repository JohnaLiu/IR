Abstract    :
               Observing and Documenting the Inter-Organizational Response to the 9/11 Terror
              Attacks
This research entails collecting, documenting analyzing time sensitive
              data from the sites of the devastating terrorist attacks on the World Trade
              Center (WTC) in New York City, NY and the Pentagon in Washington, DC on
              September 11, 2001. The objective of this research is to build on the knowledge
              base relating to the coordination of emergency responders. While communication
              and coordination of emergency management and medical efforts is an active area
              of research in earthquake and other natural disasters, this event is the first
              time where, at such a large scale, emergency efforts have been required to
              integrate with those of law enforcement and military resources as well.
              

Information flows between and within response organizations as well as
              information management problems that occur will be collected using personal
              observation, structured interviews, document collection. They will be analyzed
              and written up as a summary document for use by emergency planners and
              researchers.  The results will support future research to enhance the emergency
              management and response in the US. More generalizable impacts are expected in
              terms of decision-making and inter-organizational coordination in complex,
              stressed environments.
