Abstract    :
              

This USF/NSF STARS GK-12 project focuses on K-5 students.  The objective is
              to engage graduate and senior level undergraduate students in the challenge of
              infusing engineering and science principles in such cutting edge areas as
              nanotechnology, optics, and advanced manufacturing into the elementary school
              environment.  The partnerships involve five area elementary schools, three of
              which predominantly serve minority students.   15 graduate and undergraduate
              students from diverse ethnic backgrounds will be selected as Fellows. Fellows
              will be trained in both pedagogy and in communication skills.  The project will
              work closely with the School District science and mathematics coordinators and
              the school principals in developing and implementing a plan to help the Fellows
              become valuable resources to the teachers.  In addition to a stipend, each
              mathematics and science teacher will also participate in professional
              development scheduled for the summer of each year.  As part of the professional
              development, teachers will have the opportunity to participate in research
              experiences with researchers in engineering and the sciences.
