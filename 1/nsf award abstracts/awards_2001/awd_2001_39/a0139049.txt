Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the Polytechnic University of New York for the
              support of a three-year, REU Site in Information Systems for Undergraduates,
              under the direction of Dr. Frank A. Cassara.  This eleven-week summer program
              will involve twelve students annually in an intensive research experience on
              various projects in the area of information systems and electrophysics.  Each
              student will be closely mentored by an individual faculty mentor who will plan
              work and review progress throughout the program.  The students will benefit not
              only from extensive interactions with participating faculty, but also with
              graduate students.  Participants will have informative tours of the
              institution's research laboratories and there will be two or three seminar
              presentations to the group by leaders from industry, universities or government
              agencies.  The program will conclude with a research review during which each
              student will make a formal presentation and respond to questions.  A formal
              final written report of professional quality will be required of all
              participants.
