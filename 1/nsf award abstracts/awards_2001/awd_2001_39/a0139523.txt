Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Northern Arizona University will
              host a summer research program for six students recruited nationwide. Minority
              students and students from colleges and universities without doctoral programs
              are especially encouraged to apply, and have been a major component of previous
              programs. The program will run for eight weeks, with each student working on an
              individual project tailored to his or her own mathematical background. Two
              students will work with each faculty advisor in a subject area to include
              Applied Mathematics and Analysis and Combinatorics. Descriptions of projects
              available for each forthcoming summer are posted on the department's homepage
              at http://odin.math.nau.edu/ REU/. As well as carrying out their research,
              students participate in seminar series, each giving a fifty-minute presentation
              at the end of the program. Students also write up their work in a form suitable
              for publication; these will put into a single bound volume. Students are
              encouraged to give talks at meetings etc. after the program has concluded, and
              the most successful will submit their work to a journal for publication.
