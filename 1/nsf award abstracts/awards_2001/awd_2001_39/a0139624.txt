Abstract    :
               
This award provides funding to Clemson University for the support of a
              three-year, REU Site entitled "Innovations in Biomaterials," under the
              direction of Dr. Karen J. Burg. This ten-week summer program will involve eight
              students annually in cutting edge research in areas including stem cell
              technology and cell-based biosensors, working closely with two faculty mentors
              and one graduate student mentor. A broad mix of students, including women and
              under-represented minorities, from other institutions without bioengineering
              programs will be recruited for the program.  Students will also participate in
              a series of lectures and workshops involving critical issues and topics in
              bioengineering.
