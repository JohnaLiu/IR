Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a 3-year REU Site: Manufacturing Metrology and
              Quality Engineering at the University of Oklahoma, under the direction of Dr.
              Shivakumar Raman.  The project will involve 12 undergraduate students annually
              in a 10-week summer program of individual and team research projects covering
              topics that include coordinate tolerance metrology, machine vision, in-process
              sensing and roughness metrology as well as emerging areas such as Scanning
              Probe Microscopy and optical interferometry.  The students will work with the
              REU site P.I.s and a team of research mentors on selected projects.  In
              addition, the program will include,  weekly presentations by faculty,
              laboratory tours, industrial interaction, participant progress reports, social
              interaction and other discussions.  Ethics discussions and issues will be
              incorporated throughout the program components.
