Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the University of Notre Dame for the support of a
              three-year, REU Site on Water Resources in Developing Countries, under the
              direction of Dr. Stephen E. Silliman.  This eight to ten-week summer program,
              conducted in collaboration with the University of New Mexico and the University
              of Nevada, Reno, will involve eight students annually in international research
              opportunities in several developing countries focused on improving water
              resources (including water supply, water distribution, water disposal, water
              management and/or water treatment.  In addition, the REU participants will
              participate presentations of technical, social and ethical outcomes at
              conferences and symposia.  The NSF Office of International Science and
              Engineering is providing co-funding for this REU Site.
