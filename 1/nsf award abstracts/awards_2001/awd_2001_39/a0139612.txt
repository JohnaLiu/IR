Abstract    :
               
This award provides funding to the University of Florida for a renewal of a
              three-year, REU Site in Design and Construction of Autonomous Robots and
              Machine Learning, under the direction of Dr. Antonio Arroyo.  This
              thirteen-week summer program will involve twelve students annually in
              individual state of the art research projects in autonomous robots and machine
              learning. In addition, the participants will receive training in technical
              presentations and writing, give weekly semi-formal design reviews, bi-weekly
              progress reports throughout the summer, write a final research report, and
              learn about ethics in research through seminars and industry field trips.
