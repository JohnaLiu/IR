This award supports the participation of American scientists
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on advanced polymer chemistry for the 21st century to
              be held in Nagoya, Japan from December 7-10, 2002.  The co-organizers are
              Professor Timothy Swager of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and
              Professor Yoshio Okamoto of Nagoya University in, Japan.  The emphasis of the
              seminar will be on polymers that in contrast to commodity materials are
              chemically complex and not necessarily inexpensive to produce.  New generations
              of polymers that can justify such expenses are expected to play a role in many
              evolving technologies.  The last decade has resulted in enormous progress in
              the development and understanding of synthetic chemistry, molecular
              recognition, molecular scaffolds, biological processes, and self-organization. 
              Presently these advances are under-utilized in the design and synthesis of new
              advanced polymers.  The term "advanced" is used to describe polymers with
              non-traditional properties.

This seminar seeks to bring together specific
              individuals from the United State and Japan that have synergistic programs to
              catalyze new advances in the design and synthesis of advanced polymers.  The
              seminar advances international human resources through the participation of a
              number of younger researchers.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology,
              this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international
              understanding and cooperation. Arrangements are being made with the "Journal of
              Polymer Science" to have proceedings published in a special issue.
