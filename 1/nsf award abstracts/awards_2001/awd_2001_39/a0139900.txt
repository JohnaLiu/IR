ABSTRACT

The principal
              investigator will conduct research on two 
projects which relate to both
              Operator Theory and Geometry 
of Banach spaces. The recent solution of the
              complex version 
of the Klee's Conjecture using ideas from Operator Theory
              
suggests further research on support points and
convex sets. Some new
              geometric approaches will be used 
for investigating the Invariant
              Subspace
Problem in general Banach Spaces.

The principal investigator
              recently solved a long-standing 
problem, constructing a convex body which has
              no tangent 
hyper-planes. It is important to understand under which
              
conditions such a strange phenomenon can
exist. Another project starts with
              the fundamental fact 
that every matrix has an eigenvector. A natural
              extension 
of this to infinite-dimensional spaces would be that a linear
              
operator has an invariant subspace. We will investigate whether 
this
              statement is true in a number of important cases.
