Abstract    :
              This joint Chemistry Division and Physics Division award supports the
              continuation of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the
              University of Oregon.  Geraldine Richmond is the site's Program Director.
              Twelve faculty members from the Departments of Physics, and Chemistry will
              serve as REU student mentors.  Over the award period (2002-2004), ten students
              will be supported each summer in a ten-week program.  Selection of the
              participants is based on a strong background in both chemistry and physics.  A
              special effort is made to recruit female and minority applicants using contacts
              with science programs at several women's colleges, at historically black
              colleges and at institutions where there is a higher percentage of Chicanos and
              Native American students.  This is an interdisciplinary Chemistry/Physics
              research program.  Students and research mentors participate in a collective
              program that includes research seminars, weekly meetings, social activities and
              follow-up activities after students return to their home institutions.  At the
              end of the program students present their research in an oral presentation and
              provide a written report.  At the closing of the summer, the students complete
              an evaluation.  All participants are tracked after they leave the program.
