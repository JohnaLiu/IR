Abstract    :
              

As part of an effort to increase science literacy in the schools and
              community involved, this project builds on a number of ongoing outreach
              programs between the University and the school district and includes
              involvement of informal science resources (the McWane Science Center).  Fellows
              work with a wide variety of people of varying ages, backgrounds and interests. 
               The program is modified to accommodate first year, middle year or capstone
              students (fellows completing their final year of work) to take full advantage
              of their abilities and to meet their varying needs.  Fellows are prepared to
              work in the classroom through a seminar providing an overview of learning
              theory and pedagogy that includes two observations of K-12 students in an
              informal science setting, two observations in a K-12 classroom, presentation of
              a science demonstration and one session assisting a mentor teacher.  Fellows
              are then offered a variety of opportunities to establish a partnership with a
              teacher and work directly in the classroom helping to implement science
              standard related materials.
