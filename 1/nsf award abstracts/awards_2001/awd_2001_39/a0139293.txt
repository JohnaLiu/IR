Abstract    :
              	This project involves the third set of three years of a summer institute in
              research design in cultural anthropology. Experts in research design and in the
              link between data and theory will teach a set of 12-15 graduate students chosen
              competitively from Ph.D. programs throughout the US during a period of 3 weeks.
              Course content will cover a broad spectrum of issues focusing on the link
              between theory and the development of research objectives, concepts,
              definitions, variables, measures and hypotheses; the relationship between
              quantitative and qualitative approaches in the ethnographic context; systematic
              data collection procedures; probability and non-probability sampling;
              statistical distributions and elementary data analysis. The emphasis will be on
              concepts (e.g., sampling theory), research design, an introduction to data
              management in both a qualitative and quantitative context, and strategies of
              hypothesis testing. This project is important because it will provide an
              introduction to research issues in scientific anthropology for graduate
              students who may not be receiving an adequate exposure to these issues in their
              departments. The results of this workshop should be to increase the competence
              of students to do significant dissertation research projects and to become more
              proficient social scientists in general.
