Abstract    :
              An REU(Research Experience for Undergraduates) Site will operate for each of the
              next three summers at Nevis Labs, the high energy physics laboratory of
              Columbia University. Each summer, we will recruit a group of 10 undergraduate
              student participants; diversity will be an important element of the recruitment
              process, and we will actively seek participants from historically
              under-represented groups. The broad Nevis research program, which seeks to
              address the most pressing issues of high energy physics, provides the
              opportunity for the students to gain experience in all aspects of high energy
              physics experiments, from initial conceptual detector design, hardware
              development and construction, to simulation software development and data
              analysis. The activities will also include a series of seminars on various
              topics in current physics research. At the end of the program, the students
              will prepare a written scientific report describing the research they
              performed, and give a short seminar-style presentation to the lab-wide
              audience.
