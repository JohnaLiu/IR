Abstract    :
              
This award provides funding to the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities for the
              support of a five-year, REU Site in Electrical and Computer Engineering, under
              the direction of Dr. Douglas W. Ernie.  This ten-week summer program will
              involve fifteen students annually in an intensive research experience on a wide
              range of topics including biomedical engineering, computer engineering and VLSI
              design, control systems, power systems and electronics, magnetic recording
              technology, optics and photonics, microelectronics materials, device design and
              fabrication, and signal processing and communications.  Each student will be
              paired with an electrical and computer engineering faculty mentor and will be
              actively involved with the mentor's research group.  In addition, the
              participants will be involved in extensive complementary educational
              activities, including a weekly seminar series focusing on heir research
              projects, career seminars/field trips, and specialized workshops on assorted
              topics.  As a capstone to their REU experience, each student will prepare a
              final written report and give a presentation at a concluding departmental
              poster session and an all-campus summer research program symposium.
