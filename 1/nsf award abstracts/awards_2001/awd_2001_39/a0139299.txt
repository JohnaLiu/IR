Abstract    :
              
This goal of this program by Florida State University and the Leon County
              School District is to increase the number of science professionals who are
              prepared and willing to make meaningful contributions to science and
              mathematics activities in grades K-8.  Graduate fellows engage in extensive
              learning to prepare them to become valuable classroom resources for K-12
              teachers and students.  Topics of study include an overview of child
              development, assessment techniques, state and national science standards, and
              how students learn.  Following this preparation, Fellows will co-teach with
              selected K-8 teachers.  Fellows also participate in district summer school
              enrichment classes and summer science camp activities. This project is
              receiving partial support from the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical
              Sciences
