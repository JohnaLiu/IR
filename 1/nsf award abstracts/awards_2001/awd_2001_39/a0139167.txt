Abstract    :
              The physics Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at the College of
              William and Mary directly supports the participation of 10 junior level
              undergraduates for projects in physics of 10-week duration. In addition, the
              existence of this program has led to a private endowment, the DeWilde
              Fellowships for the support of 5 more, and other funds usually support an
              additional 5 undergraduates for a total robust program of 20. The William and
              Mary physics department, a large, nationally ranked Ph.D. granting program,
              together with the applied science department, and in cooperation with the NASA
              Langley Research Center and Jefferson Lab provides mentors and projects in
              atom-atom, atom-ion, and atom-surface scattering, surface physics,
              ultra-sonics, laser physics and laser-atom interactions, condensed matter
              physics with a variety of techniques, nuclear and particle physics, polymer
              physics, non-destructive evaluation, plasma physics, non-linear dynamics,
              quantum computing and quantum information, and astrophysics/cosmology. Seminars
              by faculty and students are supplemented by a workshop on the nature of
              graduate study. An opportunity to learn how to use a machine shop is very
              popular. Some common activities are planned with the REU program of the Hampton
              University Physics Department including 10-minute, American Physical Society
              style talks by the participants from both institutions.  The College has been
              especially successful in attracting women students to the program in the past
              and intends to continue striving in this direction.
