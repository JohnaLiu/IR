Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) for the
              support of a renewal five-year, REU Site entitled "Undergraduate Research:
              Hybrid Synthesis of Advanced 3D Structures," under the direction of Dr. Subha
              K. Kumpaty. This ten-week summer program will involve nine students annually in
              research in areas in hybrid synthesis and fabrication working closely with
              undergraduate and graduate students in MSOE's exciting Centers of Excellence. A
              broad mix of students, typically 50% women and 25-30% underrepresented
              minorities, from other institutions programs will be recruited for the program.
