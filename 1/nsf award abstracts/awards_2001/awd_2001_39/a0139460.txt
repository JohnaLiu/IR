Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Duke University for a five-year REU Site Program
              for Increasing Diversity at Duke University's Pratt School of Engineering,
              under the direction of Ms. Martha Absher.  This nine-week summer  program will
              provide in-depth research opportunities for 8  women, underrepresented
              minorities, and disabled undergraduate students in projects covering a wide
              range of topics including diagnostics and biomaterials, medical imaging,
              cochlear implants and drug transport in solid tumors.  The REU Fellows will
              work closely with a Pratt researcher and/or graduate studentmentor on
              individual research projects especially designed for them in laboratories on
              the Duke campus.
