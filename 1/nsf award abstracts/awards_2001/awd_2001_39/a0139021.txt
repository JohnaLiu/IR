Abstract    :
              The PI's will work with 9 undergraduates/year using the latest digital survey
              instruments to develop a series of high-resolution analytical base maps of
              crustal deformation processes visible in outcrops of coastal Maine.  This
              two-year summer research program of precision mapping and strain analysis will
              document the complex structural history of two key outcrop areas in relation to
              regional strain accommodation due to strike-slip shearing on the Norumbega
              fault zone as depicted in the geometry of deformed veins and intrusions.  Both
              selected sites offer extensive exposure and complex strain histories associated
              with two newly recognized areas of shear wihin the southeast flank of the main
              Norumbega fault zone.  Detailed geometries of deformed structural features will
              be mapped into a geographic information system (GIS) using global positioning
              systems (GPS) and electronic total stations for data collection.  The project
              will include a six-week summer research session, and a fall semester
              independent study culminating with collaborative work on abstracts and posters
              for presentation of results at a professional meeting.
