              Award #0139398
Tarokh, Vahid

Dr. Vahid Tarokh, a recognized leader in the
              research field of wireless communications, will receive the National Science
              Foundation's (NSF) Alan T. Warterman award for his work as the primary inventor
              of "space time coding", a new technique that significantly improves the speed
              and reliability of wireless data transmission.

These innovations helped form
              international standards for the latest cell phones, personal digital assistants
              and other wireless devices.  By some estimates, more than one billion handsets
              might be employing the space-time codes within five years.
