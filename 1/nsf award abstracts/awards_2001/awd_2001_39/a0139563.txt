PI:		Linda Sparke

Dr. Sparke is awarded funds to
              establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates site in astronomy and
              astrophysics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The first year, six
              students will work with researchers in the Astronomy Department and in the
              Astrophysics group based in the Physics Department.  The number of students
              will be increased to eight beginning in the second year. The research projects
              include theoretical and observational studies of stars, galaxies, and the
              interstellar medium; instrumentation; and gamma-ray and X-ray observational
              astrophysics.  In addition to their research projects, students will
              participate in a weekly lecture series, social events, and two organized
              weekend field trips.  The students will be housed in a dormitory together with
              students involved in undergraduate research campus-wide.
