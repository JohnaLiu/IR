Abstract    :
              The Nebraska REU is an eight-week summer program for 10 undergraduate students,
              most of whom will be from other institutions. The Department of Mathematics and
              Statistics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is a Ph.D. granting research
              department that is regionally and nationally recognized for excellence in
              teaching. The Nebraska REU draws on these qualities to cultivate an environment
              that emphasizes interaction among its students and among its students and the
              Department as the students develop their research
skills. In addition to
              research, there is an emphasis on developing written and oral communication
              skills in mathematics.

The Nebraska REU offers the opportunity for
              mathematically talented students to carry out research in areas of applied
              mathematics, each under the guidance of a team of applied mathematicians. It is
              anticipated that two to four students will work under an advisor team on
              closely related problems with daily seminars for the first few weeks to get the
              research off to a good start. There will be weekly lectures on topics of a
              general
mathematical interest given by faculty, students, and visitors. Social
              activities are planned throughout the eight weeks with a greater frequency
              during the first week. On-campus room, board, and the student recreation center
              are provided. The Department will also provide students up to $400 toward the
              cost associated to presenting their REU work at a conference.
