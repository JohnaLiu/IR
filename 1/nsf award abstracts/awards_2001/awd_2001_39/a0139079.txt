Abstract    :
              The Los Alamos Summer School is a ten-week summer program for undergraduate
              physics students held in Los Alamos, New Mexico under the auspices of the
              University of New Mexico (UNM) and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).  The
              School's principal aims are to expose the students to frontier research in
              physics and to provide training and encouragement to them in their pursuit of
              careers in physics and related areas.  About 20 participants are selected from
              a pool of applicants based on their responses to a web-based application form,
              their college transcripts, and two letters of recommendation.  Of these,
              approximately 10 students are supported by NSF and 10 by DoE/LANL.  A stipend
              is given to each student to cover cost of living, transportation, and tuition
              for a special UNM graduate course, basically the student's project, with credit
              of 3 semester hours, into which the student is automatically enrolled.  The
              students are given lectures by experts from UNM and LANL as well as by
              distinguished visitors, on topics in frontier areas of physics and applied
              physics including biophysics and quantum computing.  They also participate in
              weeklong symposia on such subjects as astrophysics and supercomputing. Most of
              the students' time is spent on individual research projects with mentors from
              the senior scientific staffs of LANL and UNM, working on topics of mutual
              interest.  Final reports by the students on their summer research projects are
              published by LANL in a LA-UR report.  Attention is paid to making the
              experience as enjoyable as possible, and the students share a number of
              extracurricular activities.
