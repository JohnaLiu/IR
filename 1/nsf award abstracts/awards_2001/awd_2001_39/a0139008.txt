ABSTRACT


The work
              described in the proposal concerns several topics
in Classical Analysis:
              approximation theory, several complex
variables, miscellaneous problems on
              complex polynomials and
classical operator theory. The most central questions
              for the
project are: uniqueness of best approximation by harmonic
functions
              in the supremum norm in dimensions three and higher
(the two-dimensional case
              has been recently settled by the PI
and H.S.Shapiro), sharp estimates relating
              to multidimensional
analogs of H. Bohr's phenomenon for power series,
              counting
zeros of complex-valued harmonic polynomials,
              Agler-Cole-Wermer
interpretation of Ando's theorem in C^2 and,
              finally,
understanding the spectral picture of the celebrated double
layer
              potential operator -a topic going back to the pioneering
work of I.
              Fredholm.

Most of the questions in the project are rather simply
              stated
and, accordingly, will attract a fair number of graduate
students and
              young researchers. The problems are also open-ended
and suggest several new
              paths of investigation in these
classical areas away from the well traveled
              tracks. The
investigations undertaken in the project have
              well-defined
applications to Mathematical Physics (Potential Theory),
Applied
              Mathematics (polynomials, special functions) and
Numerical Analysis (explicit
              solutions of some of the most
important boundary value problems). The project
              entails
active involvement of undergraduate and graduate students at
all
              stages of the project and, via local network of workshops
and seminars for
              teachers, to disseminate some of the more
elementary off-beats of the proposed
              work among high school
students interested in science.
