Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will be concerned with the
              production of the so-called "Higgs particle", and the W and Z particles, at
              high-energy colliders. Precise calculations of the rates
for production of
              these particles and their decay patterns will  be performed.  The existence of
              the Higgs particle is predicted by the current theory of the weak nuclear
              force. 

The W and Z particles are the carriers of the weak nuclear force, 
              and the calculations to be carried out are important to the testing of our
              understanding of this force and of the origin of mass.
