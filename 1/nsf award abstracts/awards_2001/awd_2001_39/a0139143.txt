Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of South Carolina. 
              Catherine Murphy is the site's Program Director and Hans-Conrad zur Loye is the
              Co-Program Director. Fifteen faculty will serve as REU student mentors.  Over
              the award period (2002-2004), ten students will be supported each summer in a
              ten-week program.  Increased minority participation is planned through working
              with the NSF AMP program at the University of South Carolina.  Students will
              participate in a variety of synthesis and characterization approaches to study
              the novel properties of materials with structures ordered on the nanometer
              scale. Planned activities include a symposia, laboratory and lecture tutorials,
              and social functions to stimulate student-faculty interaction and
              student-student communications.  A series of assessments are planned throughout
              both the summer program and following the summer, which includes evaluations
              from both the research mentors and the students and following the progress of
              the student after the program.
