Abstract    :
              The Coe College REU site has a focus on spectroscopy in physics and chemistry. 
              It emphasizes different techniques and projects in the areas of Optics (laser
              induced time of flight mass spectroscopy, IR spectra), Materials Science
              (thermal properties, density, glass modeling), Acoustics (of free reed musical
              instruments), Gas Phase Chemistry (atmospheric science in a bottle),
              Environmental Chemistry (water pollutants and iron catalysis), and Chemical
              Synthesis (organic hypervalent compounds) .  The site is very friendly and
              student centered, with students working directly with professors and alongside
              more senior research students.  The site also offers a rich variety of
              research-grade equipment for student training.  Other activities will include
              weekly seminars, the chance to make presentations at the end of summer, and
              many social diversions in a rich research culture.
