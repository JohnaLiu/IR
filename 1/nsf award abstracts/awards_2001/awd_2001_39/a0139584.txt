Abstract    :
              The UNLV Physics Department will host a 10-week undergraduate research
              participation project, Undergraduate Research in Physics, during the summers of
              2002-2004, with followup during each academic year.  Research in the department
              is in the areas of atomic, molecular, chemical and optical physics, condensed
              matter physics, high pressure physics, and materials science. Students will
              obtain hands-on laboratory experience in our well-equipped laser laboratories,
              and use major condensed-matter research facilities: the Scanning Electron
              Microscope, an Electron Probe Micro Analyzer, an X-ray Photoelectron
              Spectrometer, and an X- Ray Diffractometer. A series of group activities
              includes seminars on an introduction to research, research ethics, giving a
              scientific presentation, and getting into graduate school, as well as social
              functions. Students will be recruited from UNLV undergraduates and from other
              colleges and universities, with special attention paid to selected schools in
              the West and Mid-West. Applicants from institutions where research
              opportunities are limited will be given higher priority over those from major
              research universities. The program ends by students creating a poster
              presenting their research results, which they display at a special poster
              session that attracts a large university-wide audience.
