Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              (REU) site at the University of California where a previous REU site was funded
              for 1996-1998.  Robert Bau is the site's Program Director. Thirteen faculty
              will serve as REU student mentors.  Over the award period (2002-2004), ten
              students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program.  Minority
              students will be recruited through existing contacts with institutions in the
              LA area that have significant populations of underrepresented groups and with
              the help of the institution's McNair Scholars Program.  The available research
              will include imaging and manipulations with STMs and AFMs, optical imaging of
              reaction products, femtochemsitry experiments, X-ray crystallography,
              spectroscopy, and theoretical simulations.  Students will participate in
              informal evening tutorials and seminars.  Visits are planned to several large
              R&D labs in the LA area. All students will prepare a final written paper and a
              poster presentation on their research.  Evaluation forms are to be completed by
              all students.  In the future, the career choices of the students will be
              monitored.
