Abstract    :
              The Department of Physics of the University of Michigan will administer a
              Research Experience for Undergraduates program at the European Organization for
              Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. This Laboratory is home of the
              world wide web and a leading high energy physics center, viewed by many as the
              world's premier international scientific laboratory.  Approximately nine
              students will be competitively recruited nationally to participate in the
              program. They will spend an orientation week at the University of Michigan
              prior to their journey to Geneva. During that week they will take computing
              courses, and hear lectures on CERN, high energy physics and research ethics.
              During their period at CERN they attend daily lectures given by experts in
              areas such as physics, cosmology and computing. Each day they also work with
              assigned mentors on current physics problems. An onsite Coordinator is present
              at CERN to assist the students with any matters related to program or personal
              needs. Each student must give a final talk on their accomplishments and
              participate in the program evaluation.
