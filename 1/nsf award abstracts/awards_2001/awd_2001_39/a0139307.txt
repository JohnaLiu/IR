Abstract    :
              
The goals of this project are: to develop modules about engineering concepts
              and applications for high school students; train fellows and teachers in
              engineering content and instructional methods; design engineering competition
              as capstone experience for undergraduate fellows and involve high school
              teachers and students in these projects; develop a virtual engineering
              community using WebCT software; and develop an M.S. program in engineering
              education.  This project is being co-funded by the Directorate for Mathematical
              and Physical Sciences, Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.
