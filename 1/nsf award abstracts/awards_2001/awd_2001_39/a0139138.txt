Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB)
              to establish the Internships in Nanosystems Science, Engineering and Technology
              (INSET) REU site program, to be hosted by the California NanoSystems Institute
              (CNSI).  The project will be under the direction of Dr. Evelyn Hu.  The INSET
              program  will involve a minimum of eight undergraduate students from California
              community colleges in a program that includes the following three research
              components: eight-week summer internships at the UCSB; school-year internships
              for UCSB students who previously attended community colleges; and off-site
              research internships at UCLA and industry for students in the summer following
              an initial UCSB summer or school-year internship.
