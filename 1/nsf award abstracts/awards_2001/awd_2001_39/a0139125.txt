Abstract    :
              Washington State University operates a Research Experience for Undergraduates
              (REU) Site on materials characterization. Twelve students are recruited
              nationwide every year for a ten-week summer research experience, with a
              recruitment focus in the Pacific Northwest region.  Students participate in
              research projects that utilize modern characterization techniques to understand
              the relationships between processing, structure and properties of materials,
              such as the effects of crystal grain orientation on the corrosion of metals and
              the mechanical behavior of organic thin films. Students are grouped into
              project-based teams, each project is designed to be finished during the summer
              and requires team members to complete tasks in processing, structural
              characterization or properties measurements. The summer research experience
              culminates with a symposium where the students present the results of their
              work.
