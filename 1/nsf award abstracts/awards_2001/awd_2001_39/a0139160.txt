Abstract    :
              The Summer Research Program in Biostatistics is offered by the Department of
              Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
              The program will give undergraduate students the 
opportunity to explore a
              career in biostatistics and bioinformatics by working closely with faculty
              mentors in the Department and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The
              Department has an internationally recognized research faculty committed to
              undergraduate and graduate training, who will direct individual research
              projects. Our goals are to spark the students' interest in biostatistical
              research and provide them with the tools and skills to successfully gain
              admission to post-baccalaureate programs.  Students with strength in
              mathematics participate in coursework in statistical computing, biostatistics,
              and bioinformatics. A seminar series highlights the diversity of  research
              areas utilizing biostatistics to solve real problems in biological and medical
              science and provides an understanding of the role of the statistician in a
              variety of scientific research areas. In addition the program includes
              workshops on ethics, career choices and other topics of interest.. There are a
              wide variety of biostatistics and bioinformtaics research activities for 6-8
              students in the summer program.  Research areas include clinical trials,
              epidemiology, bioinformatics, statistical genetics and laboratory experimental
              design. At the end of the 8 week period the students present their work on a
              chosen research topic to other program participants and mentors.
