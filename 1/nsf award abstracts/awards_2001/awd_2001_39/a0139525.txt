Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a three year Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates Site program in Brain, Sensory Systems and Behavior, at the
              University of Illinois at Chicago, under the direction of Dr. Aixa Alfonso. 
              This program exposes a diverse group of undergraduates to the excitement and
              challenges of pursuing original research at the intersection of the biological
              and behavioral sciences.  This is a renewal of a previously funded REU project
              that will continue to train students in integrative neural and behavioral
              science by working wih biologists, psychologists, and engineers who conduct
              research within the areas of sensory processing and behavior, and synaptic
              integration.
