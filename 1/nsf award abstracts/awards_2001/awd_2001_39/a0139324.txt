Abstract    :
              The University of Maine (UMaine) College of Engineering proposes to partner with
              Bangor High School (BHS) to develop a model university/K-12 partnership based
              on the disciplinary theme of sensors.  The proposed model integrates education
              and research for the benefit of BHS students and teachers, and graduate and
              advanced undergraduate students, and faculty, within the College of Engineering
              at UMaine.  GK-12 Sensors! will involve faculty and students from the chemical,
              biological, electrical, computer, mechanical, civil/environmental, and spatial
              information engineering programs at the University of Maine.  Five advanced
              undergraduate and ten graduate students will serve as GK-12 Sensor Fellows. 
              Faculty members recognized for their teaching and research expertise in
              sensor-related areas will represent each of the major Engineering programs at
              UMaine. High school teachers and students will benefit from the integration of
              cutting-edge, standards-based STEM content within a variety of classes and
              extramural activities such as students competitions.  Undergraduate and
              graduate students, and faculty will gain an understanding of the challenges and
              opportunities of K-12 education, while improving their communication and
              teaching skills.  Industry involvement is also a key component of the proposed
              program. A variety of technologies, including ATM, as well as traditional media
              and presentations will disseminate "best practices" from GK-12: Sensors! across
              Maine and the nation.  This project is receiving partial support from the
              Engineering Directorate.
