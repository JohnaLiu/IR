This award supports a collaborative research project
              between Professor Steven Stephenson of Fairmont State College and Dr. Ceridwen
              Pearce of the Australian Tropical Mycology Research Centre in Kuranda,
              Australia.  The project will assess the biodiversity and ecology (including
              patterns of distribution, relative abundance, host/substrate associations, and
              interactions of different groups) of mycetozoans associated with litter
              microhabitats of tropical forests in northern Australia.  Comparison of results
              with data from forests in the Northern Hemisphere will enrich our understanding
              of this little understood group of organisms.   This project will benefit from
              the expertise and facilities of both the U.S. and Australian institutions, and
              will include the active participation of American students in the international
              collaboration.
