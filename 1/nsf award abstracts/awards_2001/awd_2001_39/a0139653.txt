Abstract    :
              The Undergraduate Research Experience in Phylogenetic Approaches to
Biological
              Problems will allow undergraduates to participate for ten weeks
during each of
              the summers of 2002-04.  Research projects will span diverse
areas of biology
              from phycology, molecular evolution, behavioral ecology and
microbial
              diversity but will all have a common phylogenetic perspective.
Ten highly
              qualified undergraduates will be selected for each summer's
program from local
              and national institutions with attention paid to
recruiting from
              underrepresented groups.  The main objectives of this
program are to 1) train
              students in basic methods of molecular biology and
bioinformatics , 2) provide
              a mentored research experience using these
techniques, 3) educate students
              about the diversity of problems to be
understood with such techniques, and 4)
              raise awareness of research career
opportunities.  These objectives will be
              attained by a combination of
tutorials in theory and techniques common to all
              of the projects of the
program, mentored research by individual faculty, a
              seminar program
delivered by visiting specialists, and career advising by
              local staff and
former alumni of the program.  The program will culminate in a
              day-long
research symposium presented by the participants.  The long-term
              goals of
the experience are increased awareness of and competitiveness for
              careers in
research and/or university-level teaching.
