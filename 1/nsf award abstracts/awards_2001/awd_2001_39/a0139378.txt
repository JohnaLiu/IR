Abstract    :
              The project interacts with and expands PISCES, a district-based,
              community-supported elementary improvement program for grade K-6 in 14
              districts in San Diego County, Arctic Alaska, and La Paz, Baja California Sur,
              Mexico. Fellows and teachers together develop hands on science experiences
              using standard school district kits (e.g. FOSS).  Educational features include
              summer and school year on-site institutes and seminars for the fellows and
              cooperating teachers and extensive use of the San Diego County Office of
              Education's educational technology resources.  GK-12 Fellows benefit from a
              program to help them develop good communication and teaching skills.
              Participating teachers benefit by having the opportunity to interact with
              environmental research projects in a wide variety of climatic, biotic and
              social/scientific conditions.
