Title: Summer
              Undergraduate Program in Engineering Research at Berkeley-Information
              Technology (SUPERB-IT)


The Department of Electrical Engineering and
              Computer Sciences (EECS) proposes a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              (REU) site for summers 2002-2004. The research focus of the REU site will be
              Information Technologies. Information technologies are crucial for manipulating
              large amounts of information in electronic formats. Berkeley is at the
              forefront of many areas of IT research, and is known for its large-scale
              interdisciplinary and experimental research projects. This area represents one
              of the most critical technological developments of our era. Information
              industries use these technologies to assemble, distribute, and process
              information in a wide range of media. The field of Information Technologies,
              including embedded systems, is by far the fastest growing job category in the
              U.S. The overall goal of this research is to demonstrate new architectural
              solutions for the converged information and communication networks of the next
              century. The REU site will bring students together in computer networking,
              wireless communication, embedded systems, and data acquisition through
              censoring, video and image processing, and network-enabled applications from
              the EECS Department.
