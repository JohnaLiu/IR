              Proposal ID:	AST 0139675
PI:		Gillam, Stephen	

Dr. Gillam is awarded funds
              at California State University-Los Angeles (CSLA) to continue a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates site. Ten students annually will be recruited
              through CURE, the Consortium for Undergraduate Research Experience, which
              consists of CSLA, Pasadena City College, Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles
              Southwest College, East Los Angeles College, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
              (JPL). The goal of the program is to recruit, train, and retain
              underrepresented minorities in science and engineering. Participating students
              will work on research projects with mentors from CSLA and JPL; most of the
              students will observe at JPL's Table Mountain Observatory. The projects
              available range from astrometry of asteroids to planetary observations to ages
              of globular clusters.  The students will also participate in field trips and
              training classes.
