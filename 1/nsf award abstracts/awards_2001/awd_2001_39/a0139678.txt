Abstract    :
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award provides support
              for ten undergraduate students in mathematics and mathematical computer
              science. The students will be chosen from applicants from across the country
              and will work on research projects under the supervision of faculty advisors at
              Oregon State University. The program will run for eight weeks each summer
              during the years 2002, 2003, and 2004. The principal investigator organizes and
              supervises the program. Three faculty members from the Mathematics Department
              and the Computer Science Department will supervise the student research
              projects.

The students will also attend a seminar and will be given
              information about various areas of mathematics and computer science. The
              projects that the students work on will be designed so as to make the students
              familiar with the process of mathematical research. The projects will emphasize
              the interaction between pure and applied mathematics. Each student must
              complete a report on their research activities for inclusion in written
              proceedings of the summer program. Some post-program support will be available
              for the students to present the results of their research at conferences.
