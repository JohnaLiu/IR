Abstract    :
              The Penn Math/Physics group studies a range of topics, all
              involving
significant interactions of ideas from mathematics and physics.
For
              example

* the geometry of metrics with G2 holonomy and their role in
              M-theory
compactifications which are relevant to particle physics;
*
              instantons, vector bundles, and small instanton transitions;
* non-Abelian
              Fourier-Mukai duality;
* heterotic M-theory and realistic standard model
              vacua;
* K-theory of gerbes as it relates to both fivebranes and higher
              boundary
topological field theories;
* the mathematics of the Ekpyrotic
              universe and related cosmological
scenarios;
* notions of stability in
              triangulated categories as they relate to
D-branes;and
* black-hole physics
              via resolution of singularities.


The Penn Math/Physics group studies the
              rich interdisciplinary boundaries
of modern geometry, superstring physics and
              cosmology. New ideas in
algebraic geometry have allowed the formulation of
              realistic theories of
particle physics and quantum gravitation within the
              context of
superstrings and M-theory.  Recently, these ideas have led to the
              concepts
of brane worlds, heterotic M-theory and a new formulation of the
              cosmology
of the early universe, Ekpyrotic cosmology. Flowing in the
              reverse
direction, many of the physical concepts in superstring theory
              motivate
new research directions in mathematics, such as the enumerative
              geometry
emerging from mirror symmetry, the new flowering of calibrated
              geometries,
and new results in derived categories, K-theory and gerbes.  This
              award is  
cofunded by the Programs in Algebra, Number Theory, and
              Cominatorics, 
Geometric Analysis, and Topology.
