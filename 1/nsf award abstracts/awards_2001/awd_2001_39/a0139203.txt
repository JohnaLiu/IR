Abstract    :
              This research by Professor Yi Lu of the University of Illinois at
              Urbana-Champaign is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
              Chemistry program.  The goal of this work is to elucidate the role of each
              ligand of an artificially introduced dicopper, Cu-A, center in azurin, which,
              in nature, contains a mononuclear copper site.  This will enable determining
              ligand effects on geometric parameters, electronic structure and behavior of
              the Cu-A center, which are essential to the function of important
              charge-transfer proteins, such as cyctochrome oxidase.  In addition, this study
              provides for the direct comparison of the structural and functional properties
              of three important electron transfer centers:  blue (type 1) copper, Cu-A and
              Fe2S2.  The di-iron center will be inserted into the azurin by a new technique,
              expressed protein ligation (EPL), which shows promise as a very efficient and
              cost-effective way to generate milligram quantities of proteins containing
              unnatural amino acids.

Electron-transfer proteins are vital to fundamental
              life processes.  The effects of the various amino acids surrounding the unusual
              Cu-A site artificially placed in this protein will be systematically determined
              and compared with that of the normal blue copper site and another two-metal
              site, Fe2S2, which also occurs in essential electron-transfer proteins.
