Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to train undergraduates in the skill of doing
              research in Mathematics. It is directed towards University Mathematics majors
              who have completed at least two years of training. It aims to show them some of
              the pleasures of research, and also to provide them with some advanced
              mathematical background which goes beyond what is typically learned in
              undergraduate mathematics courses.
