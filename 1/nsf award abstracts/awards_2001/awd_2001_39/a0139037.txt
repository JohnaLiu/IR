Abstract    :
              Autonomous parties - both companies and people - who exist in networked
              environments must perforce interact.  Protocols structure and streamline those
              interactions.  Traditional representations of protocols specify legal sequences
              of actions but not their content. Thus, traditional representations cannot
              adequately support flexible interactions (e.g., to handle exceptions and
              exploit opportunities.) This project will develop a richer model of protocols
              via an inference mechanism, called commitment machines, in which a declarative
              content is formulated for protocol states and actions in terms of the
              participants' commitments.  Because of its representation of content and its
              inferencing-based operational rules, a commitment machine effectively encodes a
              flexible version of a protocol, thereby allowing a wider variety of legal moves
              than traditional representations.  This project seeks to study protocols and
              commitment machines, capturing the kinds of reasoning needed in practical
              protocols, such as for e-commerce.  Specifically, this project will 1)
              formulate a semantics for protocols that applies in open, networked
              applications, 2) represent protocols as generalized commitment machines, 3)
              implement commitment  machines in a tool for protocol analysis and design, 4)
              evaluate the approach by applying the tool on popular and emerging e-commerce
              protocols, and 5) classify useful and pathological kinds of commitment
              machines.
