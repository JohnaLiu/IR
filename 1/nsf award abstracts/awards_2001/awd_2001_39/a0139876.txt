Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research by Professor Dale Margerum at Purdue University to study the
              rapid kinetics and reaction mechanisms of both nonmetal and metal containing
              oxidants.  Mechanistic studies of the reactions of chlorine dioxide with
              hydroxide, oxone, metal reagents, nitrite ion and oxybromine species will be
              done.  This research has recently discovered that nucleophiles can assist a
              thermodynamically unfavored electron transfer from chlorite to bromine dioxide
              to yield a chlorine dioxide complex that oxidizes hydroxide.  The reactions of
              Br(III) and Br(IV) will also be studied because of their possible environmental
              importance as intermediates when bromide in drinking water is converted to
              bromate ion in disinfection treatments.  Highly reactive Cu(III) and Ni(III)
              peptide complexes will also be studied.  Peptide complexes of these metal ions
              form as reactive intermediates in some methods for site-specific DNA cleavage. 
              

These studies encompass a broad and fundamental area of inorganic solution
              chemistry and include many reactions of vital concern to environmental
              chemistry.  The research involving chlorine dioxide is particularly relevant as
              this oxidant has recently been used to fumigate buildings contaminated with
              anthrax.
