Abstract    :
              The Small Grant for Exploratory Research will support a national random digit
              dial telephone survey of  public reaction to the terrorists attacks on
              September 11, 2001.  The survey will examine the impact of the events from
              sociological and psychological perspectives, including behavioral, affective,
              and cognitive aspects. It will consider responses at both the individual and
              collective levels.  Survey items will focus on four major areas: (1)
              interpersonal communication, (2) personal and communal responses, (3)
              psychological and psycho-physiological responses, and (4) basic beliefs and
              values.  In selecting questions for the survey the investigators will draw
              significantly from the 1963 Presidential Assignation Study and from the
              NSF-supported General Social Survey.  By using existing questions, the PIs will
              be able to compare responses to those that occurred during both another period
              of national tragedy and to those that occur during more normal times.  
              Oversampling will also be done in the New York City area will allow comparisons
              of responses of people near ground zero who likely to have viewed some of the
              events directly and to have personal ties to areas and people directly involved
              with others who were more remote. On a general theoretical level, the
              investigators will test existing hypotheses about how social support and
              interpersonal networks, socio-economic status, and religious beliefs affect how
              people cope with tragedy.
