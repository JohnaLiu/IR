Abstract    :
              This joint Chemistry Division, Division of Engineering Education and Centers,
              and Office of Multidisciplinary Activities award supports the continuation of a
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Virginia Commonwealth
              University.  Suzanne Ruder is the site's Program Director and Sally Hunnicutt
              is the Co-Program Director. Sixteen faculty members from the Departments of
              Chemistry and Chemical Engineering will serve as REU student mentors.  Over the
              award period (2002-2004), eleven students will be supported each summer in a
              ten-week program and five teachers in a seven-week program.  The students are
              drawn mostly from regional colleges, where research opportunities are generally
              not available.  Recruitment approaches similar to those in the past, will be
              used.  These have been successful with recruiting minorities into their REU
              program at the level of 40%.  The teachers that are recruited are mostly from
              the Richmond Public School system.  Students and teachers have a wide selection
              of research projects from which to select, that are divided into the three
              areas of synthesis, analysis, and modeling.  Throughout the program there are
              research meetings, workshops, and seminars.  At the halfway point the students
              and teachers give an oral presentation on the progress of their research.  At
              the close of the program participants present their research results at a final
              symposium.  For assessment of the program all participants and research mentors
              complete evaluation forms and students are tracked after their departure.
