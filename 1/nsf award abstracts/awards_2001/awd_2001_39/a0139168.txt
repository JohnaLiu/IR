This award supports the second stage of the decade of 
              U.S.-China Science Policy Dialogues that was initiated under a previous grant (
              INT 9986117 ). The Science Policy Dialogues occur under the auspices of the
              National Science Foundation of the United States (NSF) and the National Natural
              Science Foundation of China (NSFC). The principal objective of the decade of
              science policy dialogues is to explore issues facing the United States and
              China that have significant implications for the vitality of science and
              engineering in the borderless, knowledge-based economy of the 21st century. 
              Funds provided in the first phase supported an initial seminar in October 1999
              in Beijing under the theme Enhancing Links between the Production,
              Dissemination, and Application of Research and a second major seminar on in
              December 2000 entitled U.S.-China Forum on Biotechnology and Biomedicine held
              on the campus of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, and
              will be used to support the Technical Innovation Workshop that will be held in
              Washington in March 2002. The second phase will include four major events: 1)
              the Policy/Strategy Workshop (i.e., the meeting of the Advisory Council),
              Beijing, June 2002); 2) the U.S.-China Seminar on Engineering Education for the
              Global Economy, Shanghai and Beijing, October 2002; 3) a trilateral
              U.S.-Japan-China seminar on Ethics and the Internet (tentatively targeted at
              spring 2003); 4) and a seminar on a yet-to-be-determined subject.  The Advisory
              Council envisioned in the first phase will be fully implemented in the second
              phase to guide the selection of topics and to monitor progress toward the
              overall objectives.
