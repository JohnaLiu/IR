Abstract    :
              The goal is to engage K-12 classrooms in inquiry teaching and learning and
              create a culture of cooperation between the scientific community and the
              classroom.  The graduate student fellows will bring their discoveries and
              excitement for investigation into classrooms to improve content knowledge and
              provide opportunities for inquiry learning for teachers and students.  Graduate
              students will participate in courses, reflective seminars and classroom
              experiences to provide them with the knowledge of learning processes and
              opportunities to encourage and support inquiry learning related to their
              research interests.  Cooperating teachers will participate in summer seminars,
              research internships and reflective seminars.  As a team, the fellows and
              teachers will design and implement lessons designed to spark the interest of
              students in science and related careers.
