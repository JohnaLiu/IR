Abstract    :
              This study examines how gender, education, and occupation affect science
              reasoning, basic knowledge, and pseudoscience support.  It will employ a
              unique, underutilized, NSF archive: the Surveys of U.S. Public Attitudes Toward
              Science and Technology 1979-1999.  In earlier research, the principal
              investigator discovered sex differences in knowledge and pseudoscience after
              controlling for education and occupation.  In this proposal, education and
              occupation will be examined in more detail, and will include aspects of science
              reasoning, such as understanding experiments or basic probability.  It will
              examine how these predictors interact with reasoning and knowledge over time,
              including causal structural equation models that assess the effects of gender,
              dimensions of education, and dimensions of occupation.  It will also study
              relationships among basic knowledge, reasoning, and pseudoscience support,
              controlling for gender, education, and occupation.  These results could prove
              useful to government agencies, educators, concerned citizens, and scholars who
              study gender, public opinion, and science, technology and society.
