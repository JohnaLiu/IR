Abstract    :
              This project will support a reconnaissance team using recently developed
              handheld technology to collect damage assessment data from structures damaged
              during the terrorist attack on the World Trace Center.  The team will use the
              PQuake system developed by the Principal Investigator   under NSF support for
              collection of damage data immediately after earthquakes.  The system includes a
              GPS for recording location, a digital camera for photographic records, a
              handheld computer with customized software for recording data and a digital
              voice recorder to rapidly record notes.  This system has been used successfully
              following the earthquake in Gujarat, India.  Only minor modifications would be
              required in the software to adapt it for use in collecting damage from
              terrorist attacks, as the system already designed to record structural
              damage.  The purpose of the data collection is threefold.  First, systematic
              collection of damage data from structures damaged, but not destroyed, during
              the terrorist attack will aid in the assessment of the structural integrity of
              these buildings.  These data will speed up the assessment of damage and the
              repair of these structures.  Second, the data will serve as a valuable resource
              for future research related to performance of structures subjected to terrorist
              attack, explosions and fires; the development of methods of minimizing damage
              from such occurrences; and future design of urban structures.  Third, this work
              will support the development of data acquisition and storage protocols for all
              post-disaster reconnaissance activities.  The earthquake engineering community
              in particular is just starting to address the question of how to collect and
              archive data.  The PI is a pioneer in the utilization of handheld technology
              for rapid data collection.  This project will provide continued support for the
              development of these methods and will extend their use to disasters other than
              earthquakes.
