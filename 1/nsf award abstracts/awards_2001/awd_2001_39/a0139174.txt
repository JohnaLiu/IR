Abstract    :
              Inverse Problems For Electrical Networks

An electrical network consisting
              only of resistors has a definite response to voltages applied at designated
              terminals.  This response can be computed if the configuration (topology) of
              the network and resistances of the resistors are known.  The inverse problems
              that will be studied are those in which the response is given and the
              resistances and/or topology are not known but desired.  Planar and non-planar
              networks will be studied.  In addition, similar problems involving scattering
              theory and the Schrodinger equation will be studied.  Relations to  continuous
              inverse problems will be investigated.  Eight undergraduates per summer will
              work on these problems.
