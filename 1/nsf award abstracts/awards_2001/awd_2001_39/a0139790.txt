With funds from this grant, the Department of Geology and
              Geography at Auburn University will acquire a carbon/sulfur determinator system
              for the analysis of organic carbon and sulfur components in sediments and
              sedimentary rocks. Acquisition of this equipment, which will replace a
              now-inoperative and obsolete carbon analyzer, will help maintain and enhance
              existing research and teaching programs that involve detailed characterization
              of fine-grained sedimentary materials and evaluation of their depositional
              environments and their hydrocarbon-source potential. The principal investigator
              and his students are and will be involved in research programs that will
              benefit significantly from accurate measurement of sedimentary organic carbon
              and/or sulfur contents. These programs involve (1) reconstruction of marine
              basin paleo-oxygenation histories; (2) evaluation of causal mechanisms for
              depositional cyclicity in rhythmically bedded pelagic carbonate sequences; (3)
              sequence stratigraphy of passive-margin successions and interpretation of
              sea-level dynamics; and (4) analysis of ancient nearshore and marginal marine
              environments and processes.
