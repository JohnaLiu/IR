Abstract    :
              Knight and her students will work on various aspects of
computable structure
              theory.  Knight plans to continue work with
D'Aquino on weak fragments of
              arithmetic.  She expects also to
continue work with Goncharov and Harizanov,
              with Young, and with
Shore, on a collection of inter-related problems
              involving
complicated relations on computable structures, structures of
high
              rank, and paths through Kleene's O.  She is currently
working with Csima,
              Hirschfeldt, and Soare on prime models and
lowness properties.  She plans to
              work with Lempp, McCoy, and
Solomon on Boolean algebras.  The funds are mainly
              for student
travel and books.  The remainder is for partial support of
              the
Notre Dame Logic Seminar.  Currently, Knight has two students.
Andrew
              Arana, who may finish this summer, has a number of results
on complexity in
              arithmetic, using some new independent sentences
(variants of the Godel-Rosser
              sentence).  Arana is now
concentrating on problems of a more foundational
              nature.  Wesley
Calvert, a second year student, is working on complexity of
              the
isomorphism problem for various familiar classes of
              computable
structures.  He already has results for several classes of
fields.
               Knight may acquire new students during the period of the
grant.

The goal
              of Knight's research, and that of students working with
her, is to determine
              which aspects of mathematical structures are
computable, and for those which
              are not computable, whether there
is some nice, computable approximation.  The
              grant will
facilitate new work of this kind.  There is a
              larger
goal---enabling students to become first-rate research
scientists. 
              The grant will be used mainly for student travel and
books.  Without money for
              books, Knight's students would hardly
own any.  She has found that, given
              money to buy the most
important references, her students read much more than
              they would
otherwise.  They see how the problems they are working on
              arose,
and what their work means for the field as a whole.  Knight's
past
              students, and other logic students at Notre Dame, have
benefited tremendously
              from opportunities to travel to meetings.
They meet researchers from other
              universities and hear about new
developments.  As soon as they have results of
              their own, they
give talks, and they get valuable suggestions.  In short,
              they
have the opportunity, as students, to join the community of
research
              mathematicians.
