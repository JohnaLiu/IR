Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Georgia Institute of Technology,  for a
              three-year, REU Site  in electrical and computer engineering and electronics
              packaging, under the direction of Gary S. May. The project will involve ten
              undergraduate students, paired with both a faculty advisor and graduate student
              mentor, in individual research projects covering topics that include
              optoelectronics, integrated circuits and devices, and digital signal
              processing.
