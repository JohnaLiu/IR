Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a 3-year REU Site at Cornell University
              entitled, Protecting Water Quality: An REU Site for Research Experience of
              Undergraduates in Environmental and Biological Engineering, under the direction
              of Dr. Tammo S. Steenhuis.  This 10-week summer program will provide 10
              undergraduate students from Florida A&M University, Clark Atlanta University,
              and the University of Puerto Rico with the opportunity to do research, with the
              assistance and guidance of a faculty mentor, on various aspects of biological
              and environmental engineering associated with protecting water quality.  In
              addition, the students will attend weekly seminars, make weekly presentations
              on their work to their fellow REU students,  and make a final technical
              presentation in a department wide setting.
