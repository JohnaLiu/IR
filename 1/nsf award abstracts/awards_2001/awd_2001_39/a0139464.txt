Abstract    :
              The REU program at the University on Michigan provides ten selected
              undergraduate students from around the United States and ten students from the
              University of Michigan the opportunity to participate for ten weeks during the
              summer in research in the fields of astrophysics, atomic, molecular, and
              optical physics, biophysics, condensed matter physics and high energy physics.
              Special emphasis is placed on recruiting promising students from small liberal
              arts colleges and historically black institutions that cannot provide this
              range of research opportunities. The research experience is complemented by a
              wide range of educational and social activities, helping the students to put
              their work in a wider perspective and building a network of professional
              contacts for a future career in physics. The program is continuously evaluated
              through a number of short- and long-term measures, ensuring continued success
              in training the next generation of scientists.
