Abstract    :
              The Atlanta Consortium for Research in the Earth Science (ACRES) will conduct a
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at Georgia State
              University.  The purpose of the proposed REU program is to extend opportunities
              to participate in geoscience research to undergraduate students and secondary
              school science teachers from the southeast region.  REU program participants
              will work in teams with ACRES faculty on selected research problems in regional
              geology.  Projects are: 1) The Paleontology, Petrology, Depositional
              Environments and Early Diagenesis of the Sandersville Limestone member of the
              Tobacco Road Sandstone (Eocene), Coastal Plain of Georgia 2) A Comparative
              Study of the Geochemistry, Sedimentology and Micropaleontology of Developed and
              Undeveloped marginal marine Systems on the Georgia and South Caroline Coasts 3)
              Comparative Geochemistry of Flat Rock Park Gneiss, Motts Gneiss, and Other
              Granitoidal Gneisses in the Uchee Belt and 4) Fluid Inclusions from the Uchee
              Belt:  Theoretical and Experimental Evaluation of Decrepitation Behavior and
              Microthermometric Determination of Pressure-Temperature Conditions During
              Metamorphism.
