Abstract    :
              This joint Chemistry Division and Materials Research Division award supports a
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the Iowa State
              University.  Mark Gordon is the site's Program Director. James Evans, Bruce
              Harmon, Kai Ming Ho, and William Jenks are the Co-Directors.   Seven faculty
              members from the Departments of Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry will serve
              as REU student mentors.  Over the award period (2002-2004), eight students will
              be supported each summer in a ten-week program.  The recruitment focus will be
              directed towards regional undergraduate institutions and several HBCU
              universities where personal contacts exist.  The research focus will be
              computational chemistry and physics with special emphasis on applications in
              materials science.  The specific areas of research are quantum chemistry,
              surface dynamics, solid state properties and dynamics, and dynamics of
              biomolecules.  Students will participate in a series of short (half-day)
              courses on high performance computing.  Weekly meetings will be held, where
              students, during the later part of the summer, present their research. At the
              end of the summer students will present their research in a poster session. 
              Part of the assessment of the program will be exit interviews with each of the
              students.   All participants will be tracked until they complete their
              undergraduate educations.
