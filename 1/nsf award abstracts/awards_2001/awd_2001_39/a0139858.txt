Abstract    :
              
The award addresses offering of Symposium Y: Nanopatterning - from ULSI to
              Biotechnology, to be held in the context of the 2001 Materials Research Society
              (MRS) Fall Meeting in Boston, MA, during November 26-30, 2001.  The Symposium
              is to be preceded by a tutorial on Nanofabrication for Cellular Engineering. 
              The purpose of the Symposium and tutorial is to bring together an
              interdisciplinary group of experts representing materials science, physics,
              chemistry, electronics, biology and medicine, to explore the fundamental
              processes and tools for nanoscale patterning.  The technologies to be addressed
              include optical as well as next generation lithography (EUV, X-ray, e-beam,
              ion-beam); probe arrays; self assembly processes; maskless and soft lithography
              including imprinting and holographic/ interferometric methods; materials design
              and characterization for data storage, NEMS, displays, systems-on-a-chip,
              molecular devices; metrology issues; bionanotechnology including tissue
              engineering, biomimetics and interfaces; and theory, modeling and simulation. 
              

The Symposium technologies in nanoscale patterning address critical
              challenges in a broad industry spectrum, from semiconductor to biotechnology,
              where the development of such nanofabrication techniques is particularly
              timely.  It is expected that the Symposium and tutorial will promote transfer
              of ideas and research expertise from the senior speakers to the young faculty,
              postdoctoral fellows and student participants, and therefore contribute to the
              professional/research development of new people in nanomanufacturing, as well
              as the dissemination of information to the research community and the
              development of educational materials for teaching.
