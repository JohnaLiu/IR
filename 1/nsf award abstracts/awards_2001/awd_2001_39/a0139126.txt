Abstract    :
              The UMBC Teaching Enhancement Partnership Project (TEPP) will organize and lead
              a university-middle school partnership with 5 local, high-needs middle schools
              in order to support and enhance mathematics and science instruction of
              underrepresented middle school youth in the greater Baltimore area. 
              Twenty-five graduate and advanced undergraduate student Fellows with majors in
              information systems, computer science, engineering, mathematics, and natural
              sciences will be recruited and selected from UMBC.  One graduate student and
              five undergraduate students will be placed in each of the five middle schools
              to support teachers in the classroom and in co-curricular activities.
              Participating teachers will provide leadership to Fellows in instruction and
              classroom management, exposing them to the rewards of teaching in the K-12
              public school system.  Teachers will also participate in a continuous and
              sustained professional development efforts designed to enhance their
              understanding of mathematics and science concepts, and to introduce them to IT
              and inquiry-based instruction through UMBC sponsored seminars and courses. An
              emphasis will be placed on information technology (IT) as a tool for the
              enhancement of teaching and learning in science and mathematics.
