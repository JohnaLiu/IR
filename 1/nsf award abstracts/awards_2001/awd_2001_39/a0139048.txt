Abstract    :
              The Undergraduate Institute in Physics-Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              (UnIPhy-REU) at Hampton University is an eight-week residential summer research
              program for undergraduate students.  The program offers research opportunities
              to eight physics, science, or engineering students in the areas of nuclear,
              particle, medical, and optical physics. Research sites are the Thomas Jefferson
              National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, the Nuclear High Energy Physics
              Center, the Nonlinear Optical Nanomaterials Laboratory, the Center for the
              Study of the Origin and Structure of Matter, the Center for Particle Physics,
              the Center for Advanced Medical Instrumentation, and the Research Center for
              Optical Physics at Hampton University. UnIPhy-REU provides a strong REU site
              for students from groups under-represented in physics. Students conduct
              research under the guidance of a mentor; they are in daily contact with the
              mentor, researchers, and graduate students. Additionally, students attend
              seminars, go to twice-weekly lectures given by mentors and faculty, and
              participate in social activities. Some of these activities are conducted
              jointly with the REU group from the College of William & Mary. At the
              conclusion of the program, students give a thirty-minute oral presentation and
              submit a written research report.
