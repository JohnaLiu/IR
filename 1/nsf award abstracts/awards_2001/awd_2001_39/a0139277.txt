Abstract    :
              This award provides support for an REU-Site in geography at Oklahoma State
              University.  The project deals with applicdations of the geographic information
              system (GIS) to soil and water research problems.  With the assistance of their
              mentors, student researchers will be responsible for: (1) conceptualizing a
              research question; (2) data collection, (3) GIS and statistical analysis; and
              (4) interpretation and presentation of project results.  Examples of the topic
              areas for projects include GIS-based investigations of phosphorus and sediment
              transport, evaluating soil and water constraints on urban development, and
              studies of regional evapotranspiration.  Students will have opportunities to
              take advantage of research support resources including ArcView Certification,
              GPS training, and mentor/peer seminars.

This award contributes to the
              Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in
              science through active undergraduate research experiences.
