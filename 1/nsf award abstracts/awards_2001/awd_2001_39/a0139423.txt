Abstract    :
              This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates
              (REU) site that will host a total of ten students during twelve weeks of summer
              research each year for two years. Students will be working with researchers at
              the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) located in Woods Hole, MA. 
              Students will also participate in a series of seminars and workshops exploring
              issues related to marine science. The program recruits juniors and senior
              undergraduate students nationwide.  These students are able to pursue research
              in a broad range of marine science, environmental science and marine
              engineering fields. WHOI provides significant matching funding in this
              proposal. The program has an excellent record of success with past groups of
              students. The number of scientists involved in the program and potential
              research projects for students is excellent.  The proposal is based on the
              theory that mentoring and networking are the most effective methods for
              recruiting students into a profession and for training young researchers.
              Students selected for participation in this program gain a significant
              appreciation for the scientific process and often pursue a career in a
              scientific field.
