Abstract    :
              This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates
              (REU) site that will host a total of seven students during eleven weeks of
              summer research. The REU program is based on the theory that mentoring and
              networking are the most effective methods for recruiting students into a
              profession and for training young researchers. Students will be working with
              researchers at the University of Maine's Darling Marine Center, located in
              Walpole, ME.  Students will also participate in a series of seminars and
              workshops exploring issues related to hypothesis formation and testing,
              statistics, experimental design, scientific writing and data presentation, and
              career options. The program recruits juniors and senior undergraduate students
              nationwide.  These students are able to pursue research in a broad range of
              marine science and environmental science. They will also be encouraged to
              attend a regional or national meeting to present their results. The program
              will advance students' awareness concerning important environmental issues.
              Students selected for participation in this program gain a significant
              appreciation for the scientific process and often pursue a career in a
              scientific field.
