Abstract    :
              The Southwest Educational Development Laboratory (SEDL) will conduct a regional
              conference on December 12-15, 2001, in San Antonio, Texas, for the Division of
              Educational System Reform's (ESR) 19 grantees in the southwestern region of the
              nation.  The purpose of the conference is to provide assistance to these
              awardees on critical issues and challenges related to educational reform in
              mathematics and science education and to explore effective and promising
              strategies to address these. 

The conference has three major outcomes: (1)
              to provide for a deeper understanding of common critical issues and challenges
              in the region as systemic reform initiatives are implemented; (2) to examine
              current research and practices that address the selected issues and challenges,
              including the exploration of existing exemplary practices; and (3) to share
              information, concerns, and questions through effective networking with other
              regional reform initiatives aimed at building the awardees' capacity to address
              the issues and challenges.  

The two central topics for the conference arise
              from the growing need in the Southwest for a reliable supply of quality
              mathematics and science teachers.
