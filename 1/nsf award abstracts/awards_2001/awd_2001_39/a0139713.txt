Abstract    :
              The Investigator and his colleagues will study a number of 
problems in complex
              algebraic geometry. First, they will 
explore some new asymptotic invariants
              of linear series on 
a projective variety, especially their variational
              behavior. 
While the geometry of linear series is a very classical topic,
              
new methods have the potential to shed light on basic properties 
that have
              not up to now received much attention. A second 
project involves the
              exploration of some new invariants arising 
from multiplier ideals: these
              jumping numbers generalize the 
much-studied log-canonical threshold of a
              divisor or ideal, and 
they seem to encode quite interesting geometric and
              algebraic 
information. Lazarsfeld also intends to use multiplier ideals 
to
              study the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of reduced projective 
varieties
              defined by equations of given degree.

The basic focus of this project
              (so-called "linear series on 
algebraic varieties") can be viewed as families
              of functions 
constrained by geometric spaces. When the spaces have low
              
dimension such linear series have been used to find efficient 
ways to
              encode data, for example on CD's. The Investigator and 
his colleagues will
              study the new phenomena that arise when the 
geometric spaces have higher
              dimension.
