Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for an REU Site in Economics at the Andrew Young
              School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University.  The program's main
              short-term objective is to provide undergraduate students the opportunity to
              participate actively in policy research; the program is also intended to
              achieve the longer-term objective of attracting qualified, interested students
              to quality Ph.D. programs in economics, public policy, and other social
              sciences.  This award will provide internships for 10 students each of the next
              three summers.  Students will intern with an economics faculty member working
              in one of the five policy research centers or programs at the institution. 
              Interns will receive formal and systematic training in a weekly seminar that
              will provide basic research skills and that will culminate in a presentation
              and a paper related to the research experience.  

This award contributes to
              the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers
              in science through active undergraduate research experiences.
