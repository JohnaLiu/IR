Abstract    :
              Dartmouth College operates a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site
              on materials and nanotechnology. The Site involves faculty from the Chemistry
              and Physics Departments and from the School of Engineering at Dartmouth. Ten
              students are recruited nationwide every year for a nine-week summer research
              experience. Research projects offered to undergraduates include topics on
              magnetic nanocrystals, thin film chemistry, micromechanical structures,
              nanoparticle arrays, and polymer blends. Students also prepare oral and written
              presentations on their research projects, attend an ethics-in-research seminar,
              and participate in a social program that includes scientific field trips and
              recreational activities.
