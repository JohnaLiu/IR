Abstract    :
              Tellurium has a wide range of abundant stable isotopes.   The tellurium nuclei
              have two valence protons with respect to Z = 50 and a range of neutron numbers.
               Three different types of structure are thought to be active in these
              nuclei:collective, two-particle, and particle-hole excitations known as
              intruders.  Because there are seven stable even-even Te nuclei, one can study
              the evolution of these excitation modes over a wide range in neutron number. 
              Emphasis centers on understanding the interplay between particle and collective
              features and on the aspects of the nuclear forces and shell model orbitals that
              determine the relative importance.  Several models are now able to reproduce
              the level scheme.
Often level energies are more important for evaluating
              whether a model has sufficient built-in complexity rather than distinguishing
              between physical descriptions.  Transition rate information is crucial to
              revealing the amplitudes of particle and collective components in the
              wavefunctions.  Excited levels in 130Te below 3.3 MeV will be studied at the
              University of Kentucky Nuclear Structure Laboratory utilizing inelastic neutron
              scattering techniques.  Electromagnetic transition rates,multipole mixing and
              branching ratios, and level spins and parities will be deduced from measured
              gamma-ray excitation functions, coincidences,angular distributions, and Doppler
              shifts.  The excited levels in 118Te and 120Te will be studied at the
              University of Cologne.  The low-spin level scheme will be first verified with
              gamma-ray spectroscopy following a few-neutron emission reaction. The lifetimes
              of states in 118Te and 120Te will then be determined using the recoil-distance
              Doppler shift technique.
