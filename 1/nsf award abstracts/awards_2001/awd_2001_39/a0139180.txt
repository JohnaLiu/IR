Abstract    :
              Fisk University operates a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site on
              materials modification and characterization; the Site is based in the Physics
              Department at Fisk. Twelve students are recruited nationwide every year for a
              nine-week summer research experience. Students participate in a variety of
              research projects that involve crystal growth, glasses, nonlinear optical
              materials, surface science, ceramics, and associated characterization
              techniques.  Undergraduate participants also attend a research seminar series
              and prepare oral and written presentations on their research projects.
