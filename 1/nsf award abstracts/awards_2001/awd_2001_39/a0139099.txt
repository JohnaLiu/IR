Abstract    :
              The School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Minnesota Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates Program gives undergraduates the opportunity to
              participate in research at the forefront of knowledge of Physics. 
              Participating students choose a research area in biophysics, cosmology/
              astrophysics, condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, particle physics,
              physics education, or space and planetary physics.  These efforts are both
              theoretical and experimental but typically it is experimental research that is
              most accessible to undergraduates.  For the 10 weeks of the program, students
              work closely with faculty, postdocs, and graduate students in an ongoing
              research program.  In addition to the individualized research experience, the
              REU students have seminars to discuss other current directions in physics
              research with physics faculty, share their own work in seminars, learn
              practical skills useful in research, learn about the opportunities and
              challenges of further study in physics, and visit research laboratories.
