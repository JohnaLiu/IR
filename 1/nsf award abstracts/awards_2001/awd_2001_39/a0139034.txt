Abstract    :
              This award provides support for an REU Site in Cognitive Development at Yale
              University.  The goal is to provide undergraduates with an interest in
              developmental psychology from a cognitive science perspective to gain mentored
              research experience over the summer.  The intellectual focus of the research
              will be on how children and adults grasp the causal structure o the world
              around them.  Students will be involved in experimental design, data
              collection, data analysis, and presentation of results of various studies.
              Weekly laboratory meetings as well as several forms of training and small group
              meetings form an instructional component to the internship.    Six to eight
              students, recruited nationally, will be involved in the 12-week
              program.

This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to
              attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate
              research experiences.
