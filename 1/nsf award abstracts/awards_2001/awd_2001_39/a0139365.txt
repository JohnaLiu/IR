Abstract    :
              Faculty members from the physics, chemistry and engineering departments at the
              University of California at Santa Barbara are collaborating with teachers in
              the Santa Barbara School District to improve articulation of hands-on, minds-on
              learning in physical sciences in the middle grades.  This program builds on
              existing  teacher and school outreach efforts of these departments.  Fellows
              are selected from outstanding research-experienced graduate and undergraduate
              students in the participating departments.  Teachers are selected from those
              who already have interacted with the university through participation in such
              outreach programs as Research Experience for Teachers.  Activities to be
              designed and implemented by the teacher/fellow teams are based on the
              California State Standards.  A grade appropriate model for small group
              investigation of physical science concepts is being developed, pilot tested and
              disseminated. This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate
              for Mathematics and Physical Sciences.
