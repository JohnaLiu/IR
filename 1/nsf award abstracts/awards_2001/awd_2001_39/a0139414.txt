Abstract    :
              This project addresses the electrodynamics of complex solids using complimentary
              spectroscopic approaches to model organic conductors including low temperature,
              high magnetic field synchrotron based spectroscopy. Compounds of interest
              include prototypical superconducting, composites, and molecular ladder
              materials.  Issues being addressed include chemical structure / physical
              property relationships, disorder, charge transfer characteristics in ladder
              compounds, and the microscopic characteristics of the high-field phase of
              low-dimensional superconductors. These projects will advance the training of
              high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students in areas of
              materials spectroscopy.

The fundamental understanding and development
              of new materials, and the development of advanced spectroscopic tools to probe
              new phenomena exhibited by superconducting and conducting organic solids, is a
              crucial area for emphasis in the training of materials scientists and
              engineers. Students with expertise in these materials science and engineering
              areas compete well in both the academic and industrial job markets.
