Abstract    :
              	The 6th International Conference on Nanostructured Material is to be held in
              Orlando, FL on June 16-21, 2002.  This is the latest in the series of
              International Nanostructured Materials held for the first time in US.  The
              objective of the meeting is to exchange information on the latest developments
              and new trends in nanostructured materials.

	The topical areas range from
              theory and modeling to synthesis and processing as well as design and
              characterization of various nanostructured materials.  The fabrication of
              various structural, functional and specialty materials for diverse applications
              will be discussed.

	The work shop will involve most countries with active
              research in nanotechnology with about 800 international attendees.
