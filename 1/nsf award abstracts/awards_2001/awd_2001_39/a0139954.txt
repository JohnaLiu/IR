Abstract    :
              The NSF proposal enables the PI to continue and expand his research activities
              at Jefferson Lab, Newport News, VA, in collaboration with the nuclear physics
              group at CUA.  The research program concentrates on those experiments that are
              expected to have a major impact in our understanding of the spectrum of excited
              nucleons and the constituent quark models.  Various model calculations show
              that the photoproduction of vector mesons and hyperons is most sensitive in the
              search for "missing resonances", i.e. excited nucleon states which are
              predicted by constituent quark models but haven't been observed experimentally.
               The 
experimental program covers analysis projects as well as the design of
              new instrumentations, especially a frozen spin target and highly segmented
              start counters, for polarization experiments in Jefferson Lab's Hall B, the
              only place where such experiments can be performed.
