Abstract    :
              Quantitative methods for the display and analysis of a complex mixture of
              proteins are needed to analyze changes in the proteome. Two-dimensional gels
              are capable of separating a large number of proteins and permit visualization
              of patterns of protein expression and post-translational modification (PTM)
              under different physiological conditions--but suffer from gel-to-gel
              reproducibility problems.  The best post-separation protein staining methods
              are able to detect proteins down to the range of about 300-1,000 copies per
              cell, a level insufficient to monitor many important cellular control proteins
              that are present in low copy numbers.  New fluorescent dyes that are designed
              to overcome major limitations in proteomic methods, as commonly practiced using
              two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, will be synthesized and tested in this
              project.  The new dyes are designed to (1) enhance sensitivity about 300 fold
              to allow detection of proteins in the range of 1-3 copies per cell, (2)
              increase the solubility of dye-labeled proteins for increasing loading capacity
              and reduction of gel artifacts to foster improved protein identification by
              mass spectrometry, (3) allow multicolor detection of proteins produced by cells
              under different physiological conditions, and (4) permit removal of dyes from
              labeled proteins to enhance protease cleavage and improve identification of
              proteins by mass spectrometry.  The novel, ultrasensitive, multiplex proteomics
              methods under development promise to be very widely useful in biological
              research and education.
