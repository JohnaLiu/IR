This award to University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of
              Oceanography provides instrumentation to improve the oceanographic research
              capabilities of the research vessel Endeavor, an NSF-owned ship operated by URI
              as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research
              fleet.  The dissolved oxygen sensors, pure water system, water sampling bottles
              and improvements to the ship's isotope van supported here will replace aging
              systems with modern ones, maintaining state of the art capability for
              researchers using the ship.  These improvements will be of substantial
              advantage to marine scientists using the ship in their research during 2002 and
              future years.
