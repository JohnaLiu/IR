Abstract    :
              The project will provide science teachers in the middle schools in the
              Springfield, Massachusetts school district with opportunities to acquire
              science content knowledge and training in inquiry and project-based teaching,
              including the opportunity to conduct research as a part of a team with GK-12
              Fellows, and UMass faculty.  The Fellows and faculty will gain an understanding
              of the needs and culture of the schools, laying the foundations for future
              collaborations.  The project will provide Fellows with increased experience in
              effective pedagogical approaches, and will also provide a diverse population of
              middle school students with role models and mentors. Middle school teachers in
              a master's degree program will work in teams (six in all) consisting of a UMass
              faculty participant, two GK-12 Fellows, and up to three middle school teachers)
              on the implementation of research projects with theirs school students.  STEM
              Connections will start with summer workshops for the Fellows and teachers. 
              Teams will then work together for two semesters in a course focused on teacher
              learning of project-based instruction while concomitantly developing similar
              projects with middle school students. This project is receiving partial support
              from the Directorate for Engineering.
