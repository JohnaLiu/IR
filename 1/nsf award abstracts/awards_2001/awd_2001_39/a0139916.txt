ABSTRACT

The Principal
              Investigator will perform research in the theory of
dynamical systems, mainly
              low-dimensional (both smooth and continuous)
and symbolic. He will apply
              analytical, topological and combinatorial
tools in order to investigate real
              and complex systems. A substantial
part of the project is aimed at providing
              bridges between real and
complex, one- and two-dimensional dynamics. A new
              class of
two-dimensional systems will be considered. Quadratic laminations
              will
be looked upon from the point of view of combinatorial dynamics
              and
rotation theory. For other systems attractors, periodic orbits,
rotation
              sets and topological entropy will be in the center of
attention. Moreover,
              symbolic systems with an additional local order
structure will be
              studied.

For almost every phenomenon from Physics, Chemistry,
              Biology,
Medicine, Economy and other sciences one can make a mathematical
              model
that can be regarded as a dynamical system. Sometimes the study of
this
              system is extremely difficult, but quite often it can be reduced
to the study
              of a much simpler, low dimensional or symbolic one. This
project is devoted
              mainly to the investigation of the properties of
these types of systems from
              the mathematical point of view. The
results that can be obtained are usually
              much stronger than in the
general case and often lead to much deeper
              understanding of the
original systems.
