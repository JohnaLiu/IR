Quantum information is a new field that studies the
              representation and 
processing of information by quantum mechanical systems. 
              Present computers, 
which are classical devices, represent information by
              bits, which can be 
either 0 or 1.  A quantum computer represents information
              by qubits, which  
have the potential to be 0 and 1 simultaneously.  This
              leads to profound 
differences in what can be done with classical and quantum
              information.  In 
this project we will study programmable quantum information
              processing logic 
circuits.  Most of the quantum circuits that have been
              proposed so far 
perform a single task.  It is essential to go beyond this and
              to be able to 
design circuits with two inputs, one the data to be acted upon
              and the 
second, the program, that encodes the operation be performed.  Both
              the data 
and the program are quantum states.  These circuits can be either
              
deterministic, succeeding in performing the desired operation all of the
              
time, or probabilistic, performing the operation only some of the time. 
              
Probabilistic circuits can perform a much larger class of operations than can
              
deterministic ones.  We want to study how one can design circuits to perform
              
specific sets of operations, how these operations are to best be encoded into
              
quantum states, and how to optimize the probability of successfully
              
performing the desired operation in a probabilistic processor.
