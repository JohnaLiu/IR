ABSTRACT
 

PI: Feng, Wei and Lu, Xin	
Proposal: DMS-0139710
Institution:
              University of North Carolina at Wilmington

The Fourth International
              Conference on Dynamical Systems 
and Differential Equations will be held at
              the University 
of North Carolina at Wilmington on May 24-May 27, 2002. 
This
              is a continuation of the Conference 
Series on Dynamical Systems and
              Differential Equations, a biennial
event with a new hosting university each
              time to benefit  
researchers in USA.  Details, including history of past
              
conference series, can be found at http://AIMsciences.org.
The goal of this
              conference is to gather mathematicians and 
scientists, with different
              training backgrounds and research 
interests, to report on their recent
              achievements, exchange
new ideas and look for future directions. 


A
              majority of the NSF funds will be used specifically for 
partial support of 35
              graduate students and
ten new Ph-D's in mathematics.  Priority will be given
              for 
support of students from under-represented groups in mathematics.
