              REU Site Principle Investigator Meeting

 Each REU site in way is unique and
              follows different model for providing research experiences to undergraduates. 
              It will be nice to bring together Pis of different REU sites in one place so
              thats and NSF program directors can share their experiences, and exchange ideas
              on Research Experience for Undergraduates. Therefore, we propose to organize a
              meeting of PIs of CISE REU sites in January 2002 in Orlando, Florida. This will
              be a one-day meeting, all twenty or so PIs of REU Sites will be invited to
              attend. Since Orlando has several tourist attractions, and January is a very
              good time to visit Florida, we expect maximum attendance.
