Abstract    :
              A new approach to calculate the energies, transition rates, hyperfine constants
              and other related parameters for large atoms with two or more electrons is
              developed within the framework of relativisitic many-body theory.  The goal is
              to evaluate the amplitudes of parity non-conserving transitions in thallium,
              lead and bismuth to 1% or better.  This will provide invaluable tests of the
              standard model of electroweak interactions.
