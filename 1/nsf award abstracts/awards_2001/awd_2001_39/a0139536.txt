This Americas Program proposal requests support for Dr.
              Richard N. Abbott, Appalachian State University to conduct research of an
              unusual metamorphic rock called Alpine-type  spinel-garnet peridotite, recently
              discovered in the Caribbean nation of the Dominican Republic.  Dr. Abbott will
              be collaborating with Dr. Draper Greenville of Florida International
              University, Miami, Florida, Engineers P.V. Chavez, and V. Silva, Direccion de
              Mineria (bureau of mines/geological survey),Santo Domingo, and Dr. Ivan
              Tavares, Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo.  The principal objectives of
              the research are to determine and map the relationship between these rocks and
              others in the same unit, find their source, and analyze samples in the
              laboratory

Understanding these unusual rocks will help to refine the current
              model of the origin of the islands of the Greater Antilles in the broader
              context of the origin of the Caribbean basin.  Identifying the geological
              sources of these peridotite boulders will provide fundamental knowledge on the
              tectonic processes that have occurred in this part of the Caribbean.  The
              resulting geologic maps from this research will be useful for the development
              and management of natural resources.
