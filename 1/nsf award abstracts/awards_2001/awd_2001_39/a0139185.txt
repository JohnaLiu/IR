Abstract    :
              
This award provides funding to the University of North Dakota for the support
              of a three-year REU Site entitled, "Engaging Undergraduates in
              Multidisciplinary Remote Sensing Image Acquisition and Analysis Research at the
              University of North Dakota," under the direction of Dr. Richard R. Schultz. 
              This 10-week summer program will provide eight undergraduate students and two
              math/science middle/high schoolteachers with the opportunity to conduct
              research on three remote sensing projects with the assistance of faculty
              mentors. The students will participate in research group meetings, professional
              development seminars, and a mini-conference at the end of the summer where they
              will be required to individually prepare and deliver an oral presentation to
              Senior Personnel and all other interested parties.  Each participant will be
              required to submit a research paper to her/his project mentors, which may be
              submitted by the mentors to an undergraduate research conference or an
              international research conference.
