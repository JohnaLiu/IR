TITLE:
              Alaska Research Summer Challenge at the Artic Region Supercomputing Center of
              the University of Alaska - Fairbanks.

The Alaska Research Summer Challenge
              is an intern program offered by the Arctic Region Supercomputing Center (ARSC)
              at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF). This program allows up to ten
              undergraduate students to perform research in the areas of Computer Science,
              Supercomputing, and Visualization. This minority outreach program is open to
              students primarily from minority institutions, with preference given to
              minority applicants.  Recruitment is done by onsite recruiting at target
              institutions.  ARSC focus our efforts on these groups, as they have
              traditionally been underrepresented in the science and research fields.  With
              intern input, each participant is assigned a project related to their field of
              study, to be performed under the direct supervision of a faculty member or
              senior staff. Students spend an average of 10 weeks in Fairbanks where they
              live in campus housing with undergraduate interns from other groups and work an
              average of 40 hours per week to complete their projects.  Under the oversight
              of the Program Manager, they work independently and within research groups,
              live in housing with other interns, gain new work and study skills and
              establish a stronger sense of self-assurance. The program manager ensures that
              each participant fully understands their project and what is expected of them.
              Through this program ARSC strives to promote and further interests in many
              areas of arctic research.  The program also serves to develop positive research
              and life skills while increasing involvement of various minorities in science
              and research.
