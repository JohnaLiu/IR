Abstract 


Inverse
              scattering problems arise when one wishes to recover physical properties of
              an
object from data obtained by remote observations or from measurements made
              on its surface without penetrating the interior. Interpreted broadly they
              include methods of nondestructive testing and medical imaging. The problems
              proposed here include showing that it is possible, in principle, to determine
              the properties of an inhomogeneous elastic body from its response to pressures
              on its surface, and to determine both the acoustic properties of a medium
              surrounding a solid obstacle and the obstacle itself from reflected sound
              waves.

More specifically, the problems we propose include:

1) showing
              that it is possible to uniquely determine
the Lame' parameters of an
              inhomogeneous elastic body
from its response to infinitesimal boundary
              deformations.

2) For an obstacle in an inhomogeneous medium we propose to
              
show that both the obstacle and the sound speed in the 
medium can be
              recovered from the scattering amplitude at
a fixed frequency.

3) Do problem
              2) in the more technically difficult case
of two space dimensions, where it
              becomes a "determined"
inverse problem.
