Abstract    :
              The proposal is to continue a well-established and successful Summer program
              that provides undergraduates the opportunity to participate in the excitement
              of working in a premier science laboratory.  The goal of the program is to
              recruit students from the physical sciences with the hope they will be
              stimulated to the point of pursuing a research career in the Earth Sciences. 
              Recruitment of underrepresented minorities and women is emphasized.  Students
              in this program will work with faculty members of the Mineral Physics Institute
              (MPI) on projects that probe the physical and chemical properties of materials
              with a particular emphasis on the use of high pressure.  Working closely with
              members of the MPI, students will pursue their own projects and discuss their
              progress during weekly seminar sessions.  During the program, students will
              have the opportunity to visit other laboratories and institutions affiliated
              with the MPI.
