This is a 36-month AWARE/REU proposal submitted by Dr. James
              Cook, Central Washington University (CWU), on society and environment in China.
              He proposes to establish a collaborative training program in undergraduate
              social science research on the impact of environmental degradation, economic
              growth, and social change within two cities, Shanghai and Xiaman, in coastal
              China.  The CWU will cooperate with Shanghai Jiaotong University and Xiaman
              University to design a program to mentor U.S. students through the complete
              process of planning a research agenda and performing primary research in the
              environmental and social sciences at an international field site.  The eight
              week program will include a pre-field experience at CWU, a field experience in
              Shanghai and Xiaman and a post field wrap-up at CWU comprised of
              closely-mentored group interaction on the organization, interpretation, and
              analysis of primary data, preparation of the final report, and presentation of
              their findings at professional venues.  This research and training program will
              provide an excellent opportunity for U.S. undergraduate students to perform
              social science research in an international setting, and allow them have a
              in-depth understanding of the complex relationship between environmental
              degradation, economic growth and societal changes in  coastal China.
