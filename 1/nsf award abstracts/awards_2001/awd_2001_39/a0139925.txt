Abstract    :
              
In this project, jointly funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program
              of the Chemistry Division and the Atmospheric Chemistry Program of the Division
              of Atmospheric Sciences of the Directorate for Geosciences, Baer will conduct
              research on the morphology and chemistry of individual aerosol particles. A
              unique aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer has been developed for this
              purpose. Individual aerosol particles will be vaporized by an IR laser, and
              ionized by a VUV laser to allow a quantitative determination of chemical
              composition, coating thickness, and reaction depth. The data obtained will be
              of use to researchers in physical chemistry and atmospheric chemistry.

In
              this project a novel instrument will be developed and used for the
              investigation of the chemistry and morphology of individual aerosol particles.
              Significant improvements over existing methods are envisioned. The results of
              this research will be of value to scientists working in physical chemistry and
              atmospheric chemistry. The results will contribute to a better understanding of
              the role played by aerosols in the environment and atmospheric pollution.
              Students and post doctoral research associates will participate in this
              research.
