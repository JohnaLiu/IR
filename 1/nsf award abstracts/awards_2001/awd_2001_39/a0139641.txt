              AST 0139641
PI:  Timothy H. Hankins

The end state of stellar evolution for
              many stars is collapse into a highly compact object. These objects often appear
              as radio sources emitting very frequent short radiation pulses and have become
              known as pulsars.  Pulsars offer many examples of extreme physical conditions
              that cannot be realized in the laboratory.  In this project, Dr. Timothy
              Hankins and collaborators will study the pulsar plasma region via its coherent
              radio emission. The research team will carry out a combination of observational
              and theoretical studies in order to determine conditions in the radio emission
              region and to test current theoretical models of that region. High time
              resolution observations with a new data acquisition system capable of time
              resolution as short as one nanosecond will be used directly to confront and
              test the theory. The theoretical modeling will predict the characteristic time
              signatures arising from plasma dynamical processes that are believed to occur
              in such regions. The new instrumentation will be made available to the radio
              astronomy community.
