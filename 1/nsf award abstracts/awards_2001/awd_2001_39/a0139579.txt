Abstract    :
              The University of Florida operates a Research Experience for Undergraduates
              (REU) Site affiliated with its Physics Department. Fifteen students are
              recruited nationwide every year for a ten-week summer research experience.  The
              main scientific theme of the REU Site is the modern physics of materials, with
              a secondary focus on detectors for large-scale physics experiments. As part of
              their scientific training, students prepare a report and present a short talk
              on their research activities; the reports are published in the University of
              Florida Journal of Undergraduate Research as appropriate. Participants also
              attend weekly scientific seminars, workshops on scientific communication
              skills, field trips to nearby research facilities, and collective recreational
              activities
