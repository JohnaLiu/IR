Abstract    :
              Impact of the World Trace Center Disaster on Critical Infrastructure
              Interdependence
This exploratory research focuses on time sensitive data and
              field research related to the devastating impacts of the terrorist attacks on
              the World Trade Center (WTC) in New York City, NY on September 11, 2001. The
              objective of this research is to increase our knowledge base of and model the
              interdependencies of critical infrastructure systems with the aim of
              understanding their vulnerabilities to disasters of this type and scale. A
              systems approach will be used to represent 1) designed or intended
              infrastructure interdependencies; 2) the impacts of the attack overall and
              during emergency response; and the effects and needs related to
              interdependencies during recovery operations. Much of the information will only
              be available in the early phases of response. 
Infrastructure
              interdependencies have been identified by Presidential Decision Directive 63 as
              a part of the Critical Infrastructure Protection initiative. Understanding
              interdependencies is key to efficient funds allocation for design,
              construction, operations, maintenance, operations and security of our nation's
              infrastructure. Interdependencies imply the potential for cost-efficiencies
              through redundancy reductions as well as disastrous vulnerabilities through
              cascading losses of lifelines and lives. This results of this research will be
              used to identify opportunities for reducing vulnerabilities, developing
              countermeasures to mitigate the impacts of disruptions, and guide actions for
              response and recovery.
