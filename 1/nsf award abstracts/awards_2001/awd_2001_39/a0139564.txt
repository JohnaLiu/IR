REU: Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates in Distributed Rational Agents



The
              University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) is one of the leading research-oriented
              institutions of higher education in Texas. The purpose of this proposal is to
              sustain a highly successful NSF REU site program in UTAs Computer Science and
              Engineering Department. Through this program, we intend to continue to provide
              opportunities for highly talented and qualified upper division women, minority,
              and disabled undergraduate students to participate in research programs in the
              field of distributed rational agents. The goal here is to augment the students'
              educational experience and to attract qualified undergraduates to graduate
              studies in computer science and engineering. The student participants will be
              recruited nationally, but due to the geographical location of UTA, one of our
              goals is to emphasize recruitment of students from women and minority
              institutions as well as institutions lacking research facilities in the
              southwest region. In the course of previous and current REU site projects we
              have already established contacts to a number of these schools and we intend to
              utilize these contacts in order to optimize our recruitment efforts.
