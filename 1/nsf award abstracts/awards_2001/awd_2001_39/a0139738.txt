Abstract    :
              Several aspects of theories with extra spatial dimensions will be studied. The
              main focus will be understanding what the resulting observable consequences for
              particle and gravitational physics of such models could be, that is
              understanding the phenomenology of such models. Secondly, the cosmological
              evolution and the fundamental theory of these models will also be
              investigated.

Models with extra dimensions have shown new avenues to resolve
              some of the most fundamental problems in particle physics. These include
              possible explanations for why gravitational interactions are so much weaker
              than other particle interactions (like electromagnetism), and perhaps even new
              directions toward understanding the cosmological constant problem pointed out
              by Einstein. Due to the potential applications of these models it is very
              important to study them and to find out which of these could describe our
              Universe. This is the main goal of this project.
