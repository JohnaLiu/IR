Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the continuation of a project in applying the THz
              time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) technique pioneered by the group, and a new
              technique of waveguide Thz-TDS, to several problems.  Among these are included
              the study of coherent THz pulse propagation in molecular vapors, the combined
              action of the Stark effect together with TEM-mode linear and nonlinear THz
              propagation on a parallel plate metal waveguide within a vapor cell, and
              measurements of the complex conductivity of conducting polymers.  In addition,
              the research will involve new efforts in linear and nonlinear THz coherent
              transients, and the experimental study of the propagation of a THz pulse
              consisting of a coherent superposition of whispering gallery modes of a silicon
              cylinder.
