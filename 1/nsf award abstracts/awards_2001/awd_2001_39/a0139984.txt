The understanding of the interaction of many particles, e.g.,
              atoms,
raises significant physical and mathematical questions, some of which
              go back to the early days of quantum theory and statistical mechanics. The
              theory encompasses such classical subjects as the stability of solids as well
              as some very recent experimental developments on the strange and wonderful
              properties of trapped gases of bosonic atoms -- which might eventually shed
              light on how to store information on ultra-small scales.

Among the topics in
              this project two stand out for particular
emphasis. One is the understanding
              of Bose-Einstein condensation and
superfluidity in Bose gases. Considerable
              progress in this area has
already been made in previous grants by the PI and
              collaborators. The
other concerns ongoing attempts to understand quantum
              electrodynamics
which continues to be one of the most accurate physical
              theories, yet
one of the most puzzling because of its internal
              inconsistencies. The PI will continue his attempts to reconcile quantum
              electrodynamics with true many-body physics.
