Abstract    :
              The program aims to help improve articulation between high school mathematics
              and science courses and between middle and high school science courses.  It
              capitalizes on existing programs and partnerships between the schools and
              Boston University and the technology already present but underutilized in the
              schools.  The fellow-teacher teams are combining virtual models and existing
              software (such as Biologica or MathSoft Study Works) with hands on data
              collection to enhance student understanding of concepts in the state science
              standards.  The Fellows' understanding of classroom practice is enhanced
              through participation in a teacher enhancement summer workshop that precedes
              their work with their teacher team members and their classroom experience, and
              participation during the year in a GK-12 seminar series and specifically
              designed education courses.  The project includes work with Fellow faculty
              advisors to help them understand the potential benefits to their students and
              specific efforts by the evaluation team to explore ways to ensure
              sustainability of the project.  This project is receiving partial support from
              the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences
