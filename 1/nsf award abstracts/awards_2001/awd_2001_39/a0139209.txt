Abstract    :
              William Evans, University of California-Irvine, is supported by the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for continuing studies of the
              special reduction chemistry of the lanthanide metals.  Specifically, he is
              studying "sterically induced reduction", a recently discovered reaction
              observed with (C5Me5)3Sm, a very crowded molecule with unusually long
              metal-carbon distances. Evans hopes to extend this size-related reduction to
              other lanthanides, which do not usually participate in reductive chemistry. The
              second research area involves the chemistry of TmI2, DyI2, and NdI2, highly
              reducing compounds that have only recently been prepared. The reactions of
              these divalent lanthanides with nitrogen, small molecule oxides, and
              hydrocarbons will be studied.


The unique properties of the lanthanide
              metals offer opportunities to develop new types of reductive reactivity.  Since
              reduction is one of the basic types of chemical reactions, this can broadly
              impact both synthetic and catalytic chemistry. In addition, through this
              research, students will be trained in the chemistry of the f-elements.
