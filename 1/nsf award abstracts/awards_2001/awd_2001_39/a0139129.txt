Abstract    :
              Auburn University's Physics Department will host 8-10 undergraduate physics
              students for 10 weeks during the summer in a "Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates Site".  During that time each student will complete a research
              project and then present the results during the subsequent academic year at
              either the National Conference on Undergraduate Research or an appropriate
              professional meeting.  The objectives are (1) to expose undergraduate students
              to a thriving research environment, (2) encourage them to pursue careers in
              science, (3) reach out to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and (4)
              teach students to work on team-oriented projects.  The research projects are
              carefully designed to be challenging but to ensure the possibility of
              completion during the 10 week summer period.  The projects are integral parts
              of the research efforts in the Physics Department guaranteeing interaction and
              communication among the faculty, postdocs, resident students, and the REU
              student(s) working in the group.  Projects span the gamut of research
              activities in the Physics Department including many with experimental and some
              with theoretical emphasis.  The principal areas are solid state physics, plasma
              physics and space physics.
