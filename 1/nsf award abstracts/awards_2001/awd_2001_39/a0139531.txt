Abstract    :
              The summer research program in Physics and Astronomy at the University of
              Oklahoma will be continued, providing undergraduates with an opportunity to
              participate in substantial scientific research in one of four areas:
              astrophysics, condensed matter, atomic and molecular physics or high energy
              physics.  External students will be funded by the REU site grant, and
              additional OU students will be funded by the University each year.  The goal of
              the program is to encourage and prepare students to seek further educational
              and career opportunities in physics and astronomy.  External students will be
              recruited nationally with emphasis on underrepresented groups and participants
              who otherwise lack opportunities for research experience.  They will be matched
              with individual research mentors in their stated area of interest.  Students
              will present their results at regional SPS and APS conferences.  The program
              will build upon the previous success in introducing students of diverse
              backgrounds to modern research in an engaging setting.
