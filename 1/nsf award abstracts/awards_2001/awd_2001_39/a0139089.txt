Abstract    :
              
This GK-12 project is a collaboration between the Fort Worth Independent
              School District and the University of North Texas Health Science Center
              (UNTHSC).  The project will train and support biomedical science graduate
              students as resources for the district's high school biology students and
              teachers.  The four participating schools serve predominantly minority students
              and the overall goal is to encourage entry of these students into science
              careers.  The primary objectives of the project are to: 1) increase
              understanding of science and science processes in the Fort Worth educational
              system and 2) train biomedical science graduate students to function as
              resources for 9th and 10th grade biology classes.  These goals will be met by:
              1) adding to the science content of the District curriculum; 2) promoting
              understanding of science through age-appropriate inquiry-based experiences; 3)
              exposing students to science and science-related health and medical research
              careers relevant to specific topics in the districts' biology curriculum; 4)
              developing a science web-directory and promoting the use of the internet based
              materials relevant to the curriculum; 5) creating research teams of UNTHSC
              faculty mentors, teachers and fellows to work with the school districts on
              science fair and research projects; (6) enhancing teaching mentoring and
              communication skills of Fellows; 7) conducting training and professional
              teacher development workshops in learning, pedagogy, biotechnology and new
              scientific discoveries; and 8) strengthening existing partnerships of outreach
              and enrichment programs among UNTHSC faculty, Fellows and Fort Worth
              Teachers.
