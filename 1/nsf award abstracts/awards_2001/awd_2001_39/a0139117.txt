Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the University of Missouri at Rolla for an REU
              Site in micro mechatronic systems under the direction Dr. Vittal S. Rao.  The
              project will involve 12 undergraduate students, who will be placed in teams of
              2 to work together with a faculty advisor and a  graduate students on a
              research project covering topics that include mechatronics, microelectronics
              and smart structures.  The 8 week research program will consist of research
              projects, guest lectures, industrial field trips, and hands-on laboratory
              experience.  At the end of the summer program each student will prepare a
              written final report and an oral presentation on the research project
              undertaken.
