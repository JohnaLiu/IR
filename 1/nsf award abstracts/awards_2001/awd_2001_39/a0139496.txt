Abstract    :
              Clemson supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in its
              Chemical Engineering Department with an experimental materials studies theme.
              Eight students are recruited nationwide every year for a ten-week summer
              research experience, with a recruitment focus on the Southeastern United
              States.  Undergraduates with a chemistry, chemical engineering and materials
              science background are especially targeted.  Students participate in a variety
              of research projects within three major categories: polymeric, catalytic and
              bio-inspired materials. Undergraduates also participate in oral and written
              communication workshops and in tours of chemical and manufacturing companies
              nearby.
