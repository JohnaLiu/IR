Chapman Conferences are topical meetings sponsored by the
              American Geophysical Union (AGU) and are designed to promote opportunities not
              normally available through the format of larger meetings.  Funds in the amount
              of $21,250 are being requested from the National Science Foundation to support
              participant travel for some domestic and international students and scientists.
               Applications for travel assistance will be evaluated and awards issued on a
              competitive and need basis.  We expect to issue approximately 25 grants at an
              average of $800 per award.  To be fully effective, approval of this proposal is
              needed not later than 01 March 2002.
