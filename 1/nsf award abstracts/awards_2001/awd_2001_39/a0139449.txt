Abstract    :
              This award continues support for the Summer Undergraduate Research Program in
              the Cognitive and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Minnesota.  This
              ten-week program will emphasize student participationh in the research
              activities of faculty affiliated with the Center for Cognitive Sciences. 
              Eleven undergraduates will be selected from across the country.  They will (1)
              work as a full member of a faculty mentor's research team; (2) give an oral
              presentation to peers and participating faculty and write a formal report on
              the research project engaged during the program; (3) take part in workshops
              devoted to research ethics, technical writing, and preparation for graduate
              studies; and (4) participate in a thrice-weekly multidisciplinary research
              training seminar.  Seminar activities include presentations by faculty,
              laboratory tours, and field trips.  The integrated program includes
              opportunities for the participants to learn specific research methods, to apply
              these methods in the context of their own research, and to examine broad
              conceptual and methodological issues relevant to the cognitive sciences and
              related areas.  Participation in special social and cultural team building
              events as well as common housing in a university dormitory is designed to
              foster a strong community of students.

This award contributes to the
              Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in
              science through active undergraduate research experiences.
