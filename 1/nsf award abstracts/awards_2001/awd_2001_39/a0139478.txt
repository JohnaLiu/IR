Abstract    :
              This award provides continued funding to Colorado State University (CSU) for the
              support of a 3-year REU Site entitled, "Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              in Chemical Engineering Using the Colorado Bioprocessing," under the direction
              of Dr. Vincent G. Murphy.  This 10-week summer program will provide an
              opportunity for 8 undergraduate students from other institutions to participate
              in a variety of bioprocessing research opportunities at both the undergraduate
              and graduate levels in preparation for a career in bioprocessing research and
              development. The students will work on individual research projects in the
              Colorado Bioprocessing Center (CBC) with the guidance and support of a faculty
              advisor and CBC staff.  In addition the students will participate in weekly
              colloquia and a concluding symposium where they will share their research
              experiences with fellow participants.
