Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for the University of Southern Mississippi (USM) to
              develop a GK-12 program. This program will provide fellowships for twelve
              graduate students per year to work with K-12 teachers in six south Mississippi
              school districts. Fellows will be selected from the graduate programs in
              biology, chemistry, geology, mathematics, physics and polymer science.  Each
              Fellow will pair with a K-12 teacher and a university mentor to develop and
              implement standards-based activities and lessons that will be integrated into
              the mathematics and science curriculum.  The USM's Center for Science and
              Mathematics Education (CSMEd) will serve as the coordinating unit for the
              project. When taken as a whole, the school districts involved include a
              population of students that is representative of the state, approximately 51%
              African American, 48% White, and 1% Other. The plan for the GK-12 program
              includes a summer workshop to bring teachers and Fellows together for planning,
              weekly seminars for Fellows during the school year, joint meetings for all
              participants (university faculty, Fellows and teachers) at least once during
              each semester, professional development opportunities for the teachers, and
              travel for teachers and Fellows to science outreach centers (science museums,
              zoos, aquaria), and local, regional, and national conferences.
