Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the University of Illinois-Chicago for a
              three-year, REU Site in Novel Materials and Processing under the direction of
              Dr. Christos G. Takoudis.  This ten-week summer program, will involve ten
              students annually in individual research projects covering topics that will
              include property-based appraches to materials design and manufacturing,
              facilitated fluidized bed combustion synthesis, measuring activity and
              selectivity of novel catalytic materials, thin film growth, and nanostructures
              of colloidal micelles.  The students will be provided with a comprehensive
              research and educational experience in novel materials and processing and will
              be given ample opportunity to exercise their originality and creativity, to
              develop enthusiasm for technology development, and to experience technology
              creation as an exciting and challenging career path.
