Abstract    :
              Duan 9973204 The investigator studies complex geophysical flow phenomena
              modeled by finite or infinite-dimensional deterministic or stochastic
              differential equations. The research focuses on transport and mixing in random
              geophysical flows, nonlocal transport in-geophysical flows, variational methods
              for geophysical models, and stochastic geophysical flow modelling. In the area
              of transport and mixing, the investigator quantifies fluid transport and mixing
              in geophysical flown by computing escape probability and mean resident time.
              The work on nonlocal transport studies-the mean advoctive and eddy transport of
              passive tracers or pollutants in geophysical flown, when the eddy diffusivity
              depends on time and space. For the research on variational methods for
              geophysical models, the investigator gains better ' uncftrotanding of the
              rotating shallow water dynamics, by studying steady patterns, spatial and
              temporal periodic patterns and homoclinic motions via emrging techniques in
              calculus of variations. Finally, he derives a simplified coupled
              atmosphere-ocean model by averaging over random wind forcing and over intrinsic
              fast waves, quantifies the approximation error of the averaged dynamics, and
              studies some aspects of the coupled atmosphere-ocean system using this averaged
              mod 1. The geophysical flows in the oceans and the atmosphere affect our
              environment and our society in profound ways. This project is motivated by the
              need of better scientific understanding of the environment and global change.
              The investigator takes random or uncertain effects into account to describe
              geophysical flows. He develops both daterministle.and stochastic, numerical and
              analytical techniques to understand complex geophysical flow phonanuma. This
              research improves our knowledge about dispersion, transport and mixing of
              pollutants in our environment, and about evolution and pattern formation of
              geophysical flows. The techniques resulting from this research are also useful
              in studying other emerging problem in engineering and
