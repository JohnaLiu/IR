Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University Alabama at
              Birmingham.  Tracy Hamilton is the site's Program Director. Eight faculty will
              serve as REU student mentors.  Over the award period (2002-2004), ten students
              will be supported each summer in a ten-week program.  Recruitment efforts will
              be focused through the close links that the Department of Chemistry has
              developed with regional HBCUs.  The REU group of students will meet weekly for
              progress reporting and for visits to local cultural and historical sites of
              interest. The summer program will conclude with a poster session.  Evaluation
              of the program will be the number of refereed publications with student
              co-authors and the number of students going to graduate school.
