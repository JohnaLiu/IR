Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to operate the liquid Xenon detector developed by the
              UCLA/Torino group over a period of several years.  The detector is designed to
              identify rare nuclear recoil events in a liquid xenon chamber.  Performance
              data from this 30Kg detector will provide key R&D information for a future
              full-scale dark matter detector.
