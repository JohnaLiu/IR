Abstract    :
              Eight students who have a solid background in mathematics and some knowledge of
              computation will be selected to participate in  an eight-week research
              experience in computational number theory and combinatorics to be held at
              Clemson University.  Preference for four of these positions will be given to
              qualified applicants who have roots in the Southeastern United States, provided
              that there are a sufficient number of qualified applicants from this region. 
              No more than two of these four special positions will be filled by Clemson
              
University students.  The eight students  selected will be offered up to $350
              in travel support, a dorm room to be shared with another participant in the
              REU, up to $600 for meals and a stipend of $2,660 in return for their
              participation in this program.  

Participants will be introduced to various
              tools, techniques and problems from computational number theory and
              combinatorics.  The participants will be divided into teams of two and allowed
              to pick one problem on which to focus for the remainder of the REU.  The goal
              of the program will be to help students attain a higher level of independence
              in mathematical research by giving them the opportunity to take part in a
              significant and interesting research project.  For the first two weeks of the
              program participants will meet daily with the PI and co-PI.  As time
              progresses, these meetings will become less frequent in order to allow the
              students to reach an increased level of independence.  Students will also  be
              encouraged to attend the SouthEastern Regional Meeting On Numbers (SERMON) in
              the spring of the following year and present their work there. 

As a
              complement to working on their research, students will be required to attend a
              weekly lecture series.  These lectures will be given by faculty who have been
              recognized as leaders in the various fields related to the students' research
              problems and who have demonstrated the ability to clearly communicate
              mathematical ideas to audiences of varying levels of mathematical maturity.
