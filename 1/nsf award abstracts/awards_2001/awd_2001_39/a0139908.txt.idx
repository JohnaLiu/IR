Abstract    :
              SES-0139908 PI:  Mansoor Moaddel Eastern Michigan University  The
              investigator currently has NSF funding (SES-0097282) to complete surveys of the
              worldviews of nationally representative samples of 1,0000 citizens in Egypt,
              Iran, and Jordan using face-to-face interviews.   The objective of the study is
              to (1) analyze the value orientation of the publics; (2) understand the
              connection between social groups and value structure; (3) assess the
              relationship between secularization, rational-legal authority and liberal
              urgency; and (4) examine the degree of similarity/dissimilarity of the values
              in the three countries.  Funds requested by this Small Grant for Exploratory
              Research (SGER) would be used to gather data on concerns and attitudes of
              people in Egypt, Iran, and Morocco after the September 11th terrorist acts.  A
              survey presently in the field in Jordan will capture the same information from
              citizens in Jordan.  The rationale informing this request is that the current
              events have introduced a significant contextual factor (i.e., socio-political
              crisis) that potentially will impact the determinants of the publics attitudes
              and value orientations in Islamic countries.  Pre-and post terrorist events
              will allow the investigator to capture and examine such changes, (e.g., whether
              and how the September 11th events affects values and beliefs of citizens in the
              Middle East, and shed light how sociopolitical crises may affect attitudes and
              concerns more generally).
