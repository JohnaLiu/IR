Abstract    :
               
This award provides funding to the University of Central Florida for the
              support of a three-year, REU Site in Nanomaterials Process and Characterization
              (NANOPAC), under the direction of Dr. Sudipta Seal.  This ten-week summer
              program housed in the Advanced Materials Processing and Analysis Center
              (AMPAC), will involve ten students annually in an intensive research experience
              on a wide range of topics including applications in sensors, optics, coatings,
              thin films, and high resolution transmission electron microscopy.  Each student
              will be paired with an engineering faculty member with on-going research
              programs in AMPAC faculty mentor and will be actively involved with the
              mentor's research group.  In addition, the participants will be involved in
              extensive complementary educational activities, including a weekly seminar
              series focusing on heir research projects, career seminars/field trips, and
              specialized workshops on assorted topics.  As a capstone to their REU
              experience, each student will prepare and give a presentation at a concluding
              poster session to UCF faculty and invited industry participants.
