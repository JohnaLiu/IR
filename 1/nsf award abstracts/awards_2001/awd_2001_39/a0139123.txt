Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Georgia Tech.  David Collard is
              the site's Program Director and Thomas Moran is the Co-Director.  Over the
              award period (2002-2004), ten students will be supported each summer in a
              ten-week program.  The student participants choose from more than thirty
              projects in analytical, biological, inorganic, organic, physical, and polymer
              chemistry.  Each student will work closely with a faculty mentor.  Activities
              will include regular group meetings, REU gatherings, and two REU Symposia. 
              Field trips to local industrial organizations and government agencies are
              planned.  Students are expected to be co-authors on submissions to scholarly
              journals.  A series of exit interviews and follow-up surveys to both the
              participants and their undergraduate advisors at their home institution are
              planned as part of the assessment of the program.
