Abstract    :
              The Boise Extravaganza in Set Theory (BEST) is an annual
conference in Set
              Theory hosted by Boise State University. It has
run continuously since it
              began in 1992 and is the only regular
conference in North America devoted
              primarily to Set Theory. The
talks and the participants are representative of
              set theoretic
research in North America with topics ranging from
              large
cardinals, cardinal invariants of the continuum, core models,
fine
              structure, descriptive set theory, set theoretic topology
and analysis,
              forcing axioms, and combinatorics. The small scale
of the conference --- about
              20 participants, most presenting
talks --- allows for an informal atmosphere
              and encourages
discussion between the representatives of various areas of
              set
theory.
 
The general format is that of a three day conference.
              Four
invited talks running approximately 50 minutes each are
              spread
throughout the conference with the remainder of the
              schedule
consisting of shorter contributed talks. NSF funds are used to
cover
              the expenses of the invited speakers and to help defray the
local and travel
              expenses of those who do not have their own form
of travel support, especially
              graduate students. The organizers
make a sincere effort to invite women,
              minorities, and young
members of the field.
