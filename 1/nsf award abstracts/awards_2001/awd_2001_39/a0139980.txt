Abstract    :
              The process of gravitational collapse with an emphasis on strong field effects
              and the threshold of black hole formation will be studied.  This work will
              examine the collapse of a variety of matter fields with axial symmetry.  A
              numerical code which has been developed and successfully tested for vacuum
              gravitational collapse and scalar field collapse in axisymmetry will be
              extended in new directions in order to consider additional fields and more
              extreme scenarios.  Included in these directions is the incorporation of
              adaptive mesh refinement which will provide high resolution for large dynamic
              ranges.  An additional gravitational degree of freedom will be added as well as
              electromagnetism.  Work will continue on examining the 
head-on collision of
              black holes and boson stars using black hole excision.

This work will
              advance understanding of strong field gravity and will provide new and
              important dynamical results concerning black hole formation and evolution.  In
              addition, this work will aid in the 
ongoing development of a computational
              laboratory with which to explore the gravitational processes and astrophysical
              objects in the universe.
