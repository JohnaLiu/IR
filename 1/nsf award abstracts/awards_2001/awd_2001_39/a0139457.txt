Abstract    :
              THz optoelectronic devices, imaging, and spectroscopy have the potential for
              widespread use in commercial applications.  This program will focus on the
              development of wideband THz devices based on electro-optic polymer composites. 
              Focus will be placed on two important applications:  (1) the development of a
              THz emitter-detector pair that has significantly wider bandwidth than is
              currently available and (2) the development of large area THz detectors for
              direct imaging applications.  The goal is not merely to demonstrate the highest
              frequency of detection but rather to develop an ultra-wide bandwidth
              emitter-detector pair that will have significant impact on spectroscopic
              applications in the THz regime.  In addition to these two major goals, detailed
              measurements and analysis will be performed and on various electro-optic and
              photorefractive polymer composites in the THz regime.  These studies will help
              to develop a body of knowledge about these materials and devices that will be
              needed to understand and bridge the gap between very high speed electronic
              devices and photonic ones.
