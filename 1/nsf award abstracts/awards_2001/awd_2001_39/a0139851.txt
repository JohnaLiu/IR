Abstract    :
              With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division,
              Professor Paul Floreancig, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
              Pittsburgh, has begun a program in which electron transfer initiated
              carbon-carbon sigma-bond activation serves to trigger new synthetic
              transformations. Homobenzylic ethers and amides are used as the starting
              materials for electron transfer initiated cyclization (ETIC) reactions. In
              these reactions, photoinitiated single electron oxidation of the substrates
              form radical cation intermediates that undergo a facile displacement of a
              benzyl radical by pendent nucleophiles. The ultimate objective of the projects
              described in the proposal is to advance the ETIC method to a sufficient extent
              that it can serve as a method for efficient syntheses of complex natural
              projects and other medicinally and structurally important
              compounds.

Professor Paul Floreancig, of the Department of Chemistry at the
              University of Pittsburgh, with the support of the Organic Dynamics Program,
              will establish new synthetic methodology and plans to develop applications of
              the chemistry, which minimizes impact to the environment and uses ETIC in the
              synthesis of acylaminals. This substrate will allow increased understanding of
              the structurally intriguing anticancer agent, pederin, which is isolated from
              South Pacific sponges.
