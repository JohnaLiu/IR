Abstract    :
              This project provides travel support for graduate students and early career
              scientists to attend the Chapman conference on Volcanism and the Earth's
              Atmosphere.  The Chapman conferences are topical meetings sponsored by the
              American Geophysical Union that are designed to promote opportunities not
              normally available through the format of larger scientific meetings.  This
              year's Chapman Conference will focus on the effects of volcanic eruptions on
              the Earth's atmosphere and environment and marks the 10th anniversary of these
              conferences.  The meeting will be held on the island of Thera in Greece, the
              site of the Santorini eruption in the Late Bronze Age and one of the most
              important volcanic eruptions that profoundly affected civilization.  It will
              draw together experts from the climatology, volcanology, glaciology, and
              petrology communities to review recent work and plan for joint efforts to
              further progress in this field.
