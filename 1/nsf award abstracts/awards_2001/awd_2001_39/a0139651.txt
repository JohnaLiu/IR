Abstract    :
              North Dakota State University (NDSU) is organizing what it refers to as "The
              First Virtual Conference on Genomics and Bioinformatics" to be held on October
              15-16, 2001.   NDSU will be using technology jointly funded, originally, by
              ANIR and EPSCoR.

The goals of the conference are to "1) transcend
              geographical and economical factors limiting researchers around the world, 2)
              increase the exchange of ideas and establish new ways of collaborating with
              others and 3) establish new ways to excite the K-20 community about today's
              multidisciplinary science."  

Some speakers will participate from the NDSU
              campus while others will "telecommute" via the Access Grid. Individuals will be
              able to participate from Access Grid Node sites around the world and via
              real-time video-streaming technology from their computer desktops.
