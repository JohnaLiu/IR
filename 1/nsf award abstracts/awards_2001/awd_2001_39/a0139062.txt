Abstract    :
              This proposal supports a mini-conference on CP violation, in honor of Roberto
              Peccei on the occasion of his 60th birthday, "Peccei Fest: Past, Present, and
              Future of CP-Violation." Topics covered in the workshop include CP-violation,
              axions, and heavy flavor physics---all areas where progress has been made and
              many open questions remain.
