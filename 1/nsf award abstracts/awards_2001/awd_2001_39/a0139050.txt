Abstract    :
              The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) operates a Research
              Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in its Materials Science and
              Engineering Laboratory.  Students are recruited from across the country for a
              twelve-week summer research experience, with an emphasis on recruitment of
              members of underrepresented groups in science and engineering.  Students
              participate in a wide range of research in the areas of ceramics, solid state
              chemistry, metallurgy, polymers, neutron condensed matter science, and
              materials reliability.  In addition, students attend a weekly seminar series
              and participate in various social activities.

The REU students have access
              to exceptional instrumentation and facilities at NIST.  The experience also
              includes an early and valuable exposure to the interdisciplinary research
              environment of a national laboratory.
