NSF Program : 7179      GRAD TEACHING FELLOWS IN K-12

Abstract    :
              The goal of the program is to provide K-12 teachers and students with recent
              knowledge and innovative learning activities in the areas of biology,
              environmental science, aquatic science, geology, meteorology, and oceanography
              and to relate these topics to the impacts of environmental change on Texas
              habitats and residents. The school districts involved range from 1 to 17%
              limited English proficiency, from 23 to 47% economically disadvantaged, and
              from 12 to 65% minority.  This project emphasizes field research for students
              and teachers and builds on three existing programs between The University of
              Texas at Austin and local school systems from the Texas coast to the State's
              interior: The Marine Science Institute's Study of Arctic Change, The Institute
              for Geophysics' Adopt a School, Teachers in the Field, and the Environmental
              Science Institute's Outreach Lecture Series. Special features of the program
              include numerous field activities for K-12 students and teachers led by
              Graduate Fellows, summer workshops for teachers focused on developing content
              knowledge in targeted interdisciplinary subjects aligned with State educational
              standards and goals, joint participation by teachers and Graduate Fellows at
              local and regional science conferences, and building partnerships between
              undergraduate science and mathematics students seeking teaching certification
              with Graduate Fellows and K-12 teachers. This project receives partial support
              from the Geoscience Directorate.
