Abstract    :
              This award supports an REU site that was initiated in 1999 with the purpose of
              introducing students and faculty members at Clark Atlanta University to
              interdisciplinary studies in geosciences.  Ten students are selected each year
              from Clark Atlanta and other academic institutions to participate in a ten-week
              summer program consisting of lectures and research projects.  These activities
              are designed to complement the regular program in Earth System Science (ESS) at
              Clark Atlanta.  The projects include data analysis and modeling activities on
              topics related to (1) the effects of atmospheric gases and aerosols on solar
              radiation, and (2) micrometeorological processes in the atmospheric boundary
              layer.  The students work closely with the principal investigator in defining
              and planning their research projects, writing final reports that document their
              summer activities, and preparing oral and poster presentations on their
              research findings.  Objectives of the program are to enable students to think
              critically, to encourage them to approach problems from an interdisciplinary
              point of view, and to increase the number of minority students seeking graduate
              degrees and careers in ESS and related areas of study.
