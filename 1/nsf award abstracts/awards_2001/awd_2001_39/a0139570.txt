Abstract    :
              This is an interdisciplinary program to teach mathematics, science and
              technology at middle schools in Arkansas.  The approach is based on a "learning
              through doing" paradigm, using the theme of optic and electronic concepts in
              everyday life.  Goals are to be achieved by creating (teaching) teams
              consisting of graduate fellows, school teachers, university faculty,
              administrators, and parents of students.  This project is being co-funded by
              the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities.
