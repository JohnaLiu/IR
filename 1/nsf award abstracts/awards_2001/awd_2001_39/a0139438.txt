Abstract    :
              This award provides continued  funding for a 3-year REU Site Program in Membrane
              Applied Science and Technology, at the University of Cincinnati, under the
              direction of Dr. William B. Krantz.  This 10-week summer program will provide
              10 chemical engineering undergraduate students from other institutions with
              research experiences  with particularly emphasizing biomedical and
              pharmaceutical applications.  This Site Program will be linked to the
              Cincinnati site of the NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Membrane Applied Science and Technology (MAST), the only block-funded membrane
              research center in the U.S.  Each student will be assigned a faculty mentor and
              will work with graduate students in the MAST Center on challenging research
              problems defined by interaction with industry, interdisciplinary research, and
              exceptional facilities.  In addition, the students will participate in a
              seminar focusing on research methods, probelm solving, ethics, communications
              skills and a student posters competition.
