The problem of constructing infinitely many number
              fields of class
number one descends from Gauss's work on quadratic forms, and
              remains
one of the major unsolved problems in algebraic number theory. 
              This
has been the inspiration for many new ideas and techniques in
algebraic
              number theory and arithmetic geometry.  The proposers plan a
sustained attack
              on this problem using geometric methods based upon
recent advances in the
              theory of hyperbolic manifolds coupled with a
natural broadening of the
              classical Bianchi- Hurwitz theorem.
Possible important mathematical
              by-products include new techniques
for estimating class numbers and an
              improvement of the
understanding of properties of the trace fields of
              hyperbolic
manifolds.

Further  consequences of this work of a somewhat
              broader impact  also
seem possible. The most obviously relevant applications
              seem to
come from the direction of cryptography.  The  difficulty of
              factoring
numbers into primes is the basis for the RSA cryptosystem. The
              fastest
known algorithm  for factoring large whole numbers into primes is
              the
so-called number field sieve, and the techniques from algebraic
              number
theory involved in this sieve were developed in part from work on
              class
numbers.   This project could impact such algorithms and progress
              on
factoring problems would have significant implications for cryptography.
