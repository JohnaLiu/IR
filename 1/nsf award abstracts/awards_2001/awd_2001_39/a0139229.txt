Abstract    :
              Cornell's Summer REU Program in Mathematics (Analysis on fractals, dynamics,
              geometry, combinatorics, mathematical biology)

Each summer, 10 undergraduate
              students will participate in an 8 week research program in the Cornell
              University Mathematics Department directed by 3 faculty members (the Principal
              Investigator, R. Strichartz, and 2 others chosen from among department members
              and visitors). The students will work on research projects that are within
              their grasp, and which present real opportunities for new discoveries that will
              be of value to the mathematical community. It is expected that some, but not
              all, of the research will lead to published papers. Two types of projects will
              be emphasized: 1) computer related research, with students 
writing programs,
              or using existing software, to work out examples, generate conjectures, and
              perform experiments in areas such as analysis on fractals, iterations of
              rational mappings, dynamics of differential equations, and probabilistic models
              in genetics; 2) problems in geometry and combinatorics that do not require a
              great deal of background knowledge. In addition, the students will gain
              experience in communicating mathematics by presenting talks to each other and
              to the public.
