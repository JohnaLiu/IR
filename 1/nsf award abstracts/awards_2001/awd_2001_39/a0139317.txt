Abstract    :
              

The Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Notre Dame is
              sponsoring a NSF-REU Site for undergraduate research during the summers of 2001
              - 2003.  The focal point of the proposed REU projects is the use of model
              systems and basic research to study the cellular and molecular basis of
              disease.  A nationwide search will be conducted for 14 sophomore or junior
              participants.  The primary goals of our program are to 1) expose students to
              the excitement of scientific discovery, 2) help students develop the skills
              needed to generate, analyze and report scientific data, 3) educate students on
              the professionalism needed to succeed in graduate school and beyond, 4) give
              students opportunities for leadership roles, and 5) encourage students to be
              responsible scientists and citizens by providing international research
              experiences and service opportunities.  To reach these goals, participants will
              carry out research projects for 9 weeks.  During these 9 weeks, they will speak
              on their proposed work twice, attend and coordinate a weekly seminar program to
              develop students professional and leadership skills, as well as to educate them
              on various career paths in biological sciences, attend weekly journal clubs
              where students will present current published research, and participate in an
              optional service component mentoring high school students.  New to our proposed
              program is an international research component for two students each summer. 
              The underlying aim of the program is to give students strong incentives for
              pursuing careers in research.
