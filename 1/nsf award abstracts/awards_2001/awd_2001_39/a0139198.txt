Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for an REU Site in anthropology in West Central
              Highland Guatemala. The topic for the Site is culture change and continuity in
              Guatemala.  Twelve undergraduate students will participate in the 12-week
              summer program.  The students will be recruited from Brigham Young University,
              University of Illinois-Chicago, University of Texas-Pan American, and Southwest
              Texas State University.  The goal of the Site is to prepare a diversified pool
              of talented undergraduates, especially those from underrepresented groups, for
              full participation in the professional community of social science by
              experiencing all the stages of research, including problem conceptualization,
              independent field research, analysis, write up, oral presentation at academic
              fora, and scholarly publication.   While in the field, students will conduct
              ethnographic field research and also attend a weekly methods and ethics
              seminar.  

This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to
              attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate
              research experiences.
