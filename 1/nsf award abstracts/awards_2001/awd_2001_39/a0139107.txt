Abstract    :
              Princeton University operates a multidisciplinary Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) site affiliated with the Princeton Materials Institute
              (PMI). Fifteen undergraduate students are recruited nationwide every year for a
              nine-week summer research experience under the supervision of science and
              engineering faculty associated with PMI. Students also attend short courses and
              seminars on materials science and engineering topics, and participate in visits
              to local companies involved in materials processing and engineering. Through a
              series of presentations and organized discussion groups, students are
              challenged to examine the role of science and engineering research against a
              broader societal context.
