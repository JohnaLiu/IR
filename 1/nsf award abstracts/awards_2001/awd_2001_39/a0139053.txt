The project  is about
              international collaboration with researchers in Korea, focusing on the
              development and analysis of new finitie element method using singular and dual
              singular functions for both interface and elasticity problems and
              implementation of multilevel methods for the resulting system of linear
              equations. From this study, the application of the proposed method will be
              identified in the are of fracture mechanics.
