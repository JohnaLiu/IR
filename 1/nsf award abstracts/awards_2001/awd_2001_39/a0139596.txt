Abstract    :
              The research focuses on providing a better understanding on the non-perturbative
              interaction of matter with short, intense laser pulses.  Computer simulations
              are used to provide a detailed picture, spatially and temporally, of the
              evolution of these systems in the electromagnetic field.  Where appropriate,
              the relativistic form of the Schroedinger equation is used to study the
              dynamics.
