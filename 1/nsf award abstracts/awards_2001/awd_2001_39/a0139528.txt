Abstract    :
              
This award provides support to the University of Colorado, Denver to host the
              American Economics Association Summer Training Program.  A primary goal of this
              program is to increase the number of minorities in the economics profession. 
              This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site is a nine-week program
              for 15 student participants aimed at strengthening their analytic skills and to
              demonstrate the relevance and excitement of economics as a profession.  The
              program will combine hands-on empirical research with honors-level coursework
              in economic theory, econometric methods, and mathematical economics.  Weekly
              workshops and seminars by outside speakers will familiarize students with
              policy issues and career options.

This award contributes to the Foundation's
              continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through
              active undergraduate research experiences.
