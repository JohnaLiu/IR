Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Columbia University.  Leonard Fine
              is the site's Program Director and Bhawana Venkataraman is the Co-Program
              Director. Twenty-four faculty will serve as REU student mentors.  Over the
              award period (2002-2004), ten students will be supported each summer in a
              ten-week program.  To increase their record in the past of 15% minority
              students to at least 20%, they will actively develop personal contacts at
              minority serving institutions with faculty and administrators.  Research
              available to the students includes analytical and theoretical chemistry,
              synthetic and biological chemistry, physical and inorganic chemistry, solid
              state and nanochemistry, polymer chemistry and materials research. Students
              will participate on a regular basis in group meetings and seminars.  Two
              daylong field trips are planned -- one to a national laboratory and the other
              to an industrial laboratory.  An external review is being developed in addition
              to students and research mentors completing a survey both at the start and at
              the end of the program.  Students in the program will be tracked in subsequent
              years.
