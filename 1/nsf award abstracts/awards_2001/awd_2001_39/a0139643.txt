Abstract    :
               
This award provides funding to Johns Hopkins University for the support of a
              three-year, REU Site in Chemical, Cell and Tissue Engineering, under the
              direction of Dr. Michael E. Paulaitis.  This ten-week summer program will
              involve ten students annually in an intensive, challenging research experience
              in the exciting and rapidly growing areas of biochemical, cell, and tissue
              engineering.  Each student will be closely mentored by an individual faculty
              mentor and will become a member of his or her research team working on a
              specific project in the faculty mentor's laboratories. The students will take a
              required technical communication course that introduces them to the
              fundamentals of technical writing and oral presentations.  Students will
              present oral and written reports on their research as part of this course. 
              Finally, the Department of Chemical Engineering will sponsor an undergraduate
              research symposium for students in the REU program as an open forum for
              presenting their research results.
