Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a 3-year REU Site in Chemical Engineering at the
              Nanoscale, at the University of Connecticut, under the direction of Dr. Joseph
              J. Helble.  This 10-week summer program will provide 10 chemical engineering
              undergraduate students from other institutions with the opportunity to work
              with chemical engineering faculty on projects that emphasize chemical
              engineering at the nanoscale.  Because all of the faculty are participants in
              major interdisciplinary research centers on campus, students will have access
              to technician-assisted state of the art instrumentation in analytical
              chemistry, surface science, and biotechnology for their research.  Recruiting
              will be done nationally with a special emphasis on local small colleges and the
              University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez.  In addition to the laboratory research
              experience, communication skills development will be stressed through meetings,
              discussions, short written summaries, and an end-of-summer REU Research
              Symposium.  A rich seminar program will also provide a practical perspective on
              the developing importance of nanotechnology through a plant trip and lectures
              by industrial scientists, and will stress recognition of issues of scientific
              ethics through a special program of faculty-moderated discussions and a
              half-day workshop led by the Director of the Scientific Freedom, Responsibility
              and Law Program of the American Association for the Advancement of Science
              (AAAS).
