Abstract    :
              This research addresses a fundamental question regarding the nature of
the
              charge structure of the neutron --- one of the basic building blocks
of
              matter: What is the spatial distribution of the constituent quarks
within the
              neutron, which has a net zero charge? This question was
addressed in Jefferson
              Laboratory Experiment 93-038 by scattering
longitudinally polarized electrons
              quasielastically from a neutron in
deuterium.  Deuterium consists of a neutron
              and a proton bound loosely
together; it represents the best neutron target
              available.  In a
collision with the neutron, the electron transfers
              polarization to the
neutron.  Both components of the neutron polarization
              vector lie in the
scattering plane: The transverse (or sideways) component is
              normal to
the momentum of the neutron, and the longitudinal component is
              parallel
(or antiparallel) to the neutron momentum.  By measuring both
              the
sideways and the longitudinal polarizations, it is possible to extract
              a
quantity called the neutron electric form factor, which is designated
              by
the letters GEN.  Measurements of GEN as a function of momentum
              transfer
are related to the spatial distribution of charge within the
              neutron.
The uncertainty in our knowledge of the interior charge density of
              the
neutron becomes smaller as measurements of GEN are extended to
              higher
momentum transfer.  Knowledge of GEN is essential to understanding
              the
structure of matter.  GEN is a fundamental quantity needed to
              challenge
models of nucleon structure, to make detailed microscopic
              calculations
of electric structure functions, and to interpret the results
              of
parity-violating experiments.  The current research involves carrying
out
              and completing a detailed analysis of the data obtained from
E93-038,
              preparing the results for publication, and preparing and
carrying out a new
              experiment to extract GEN at still higher momentum
transfers.
