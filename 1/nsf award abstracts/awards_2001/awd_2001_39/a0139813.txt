Abstract    :
              There are two main approches to motivic (co-)homology appearing in
recent
              years. First, one tries to construct it as cohomology groups
of certain
              complexes with terms being given by explicit
generators and relations
              generalizing Milnor's K-groups. Second, one
can construct cohomology of a
              scheme as cohomology of a complex
defined in terms of algebraic cycles thus
              generalizing the classical
defintion of Chow groups. Each has its own
              advantages and disadvantages.
Dr. Jianqiang Zhao's research will continue his
              work
on understanding both approaches by using
polylogarithms and their
              generalizations. 
Polylogarithms have been around for centuries in one form
              or
another, but only recently has their whole theory become available. 
They
              have deep connections with both number theory and modern 
mathematical
              physics. This project should shed light on these connections. 

This research
              is in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, 
a subject that combines the
              techniques of algebraic geometry and number
theory. In its original
              formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures 
that could be defined in the
              plane by the simplest equations, 
namely polynomials. Number theory
is the
              study of numbers that can be expressed in
terms of whole numbers, 1, 2, 3...
              In the second half
of last century these two seemingly far apart subjects have
              produced 
tremendous impact on each other. The field of arithmetic algebraic
              
geometry now uses techniques from all of modern mathematics.
