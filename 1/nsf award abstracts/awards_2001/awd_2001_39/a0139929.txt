Abstract    :
              This project continues first principles studies of quantum
chromodynamics (the
              theory of the strong interactions) through the use
of high performance
              computer simulations.  Emphasis is to be placed on
using improved algorithms
              to extract the most precise values to date
of key numbers in the Standard
              Model of the fundamental interactions
in Nature.  Results to be obtained are
              essential for analyzing
experimental measurements at national accelerator
              laboratories and to
test the internal consistency of the Model.  They may lead
              to clues
about more fundamental interactions.  They will also be used
              to
continue studies of the high temperature phase transition between
confined
              matter and the quark-gluon plasma and of the strange quark
content of the
              plasma.  Such a phase transition occurred in the
evolution of the early
              Universe and is thought to be achievable in the
laboratory in collisions of
              heavy ions at the RHIC accelerator, which
recently began operation at the
              Brookhaven National Laboratory.

These studies are important for extending
              our understanding of the
most fundamental basis of our physical world and of
              the origins of our
Universe.  Algorithmic ideas are likely to have
              applications in other
computational fields.
