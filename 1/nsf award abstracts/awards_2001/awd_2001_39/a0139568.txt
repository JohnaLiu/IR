Abstract    :
              The total collapse of both 110-story tall towers of the World Trade Center (WTC)
              as a result of the fires initiated by the commercial passenger jet collisions
              on September 11, 2001, raises a number of important scientific questions
              regarding the performance of high-rise buildings in response to such impacts
              and the resulting fires.  For the fire safety of current and future high-rise
              buildings, it is important to determine why the WTC towers collapsed in the way
              they did and in the relatively brief period of time they did.  To make such a
              determination and to improve the design and construction of high-rise buildings
              against catastrophic collapse, comprehensive studies of the WTC collapses will
              be needed in the future.  For such studies to be valid, reliable information
              and data will be needed on many aspects of the WTC towers. The purpose of this
              project is to collect perishable data on the fire protection engineering
              aspects of the WTC affecting the fire and collapse that may be lost as the
              material and debris are removed from the site and as these events fade from the
              news.  

The PI is collaborating with Prof. Astaneh-Asl of the University of
              California at Berkeley who is collecting perishable data on the structural
              engineering aspects of the WTC.  Together, the data obtained in these projects
              will be of critical importance to future analyses of the WTC collapses.
