This is a planning visit for Dr. Ursula Bechert, with the
              Department of Biomedical Sciences at Oregon State University, to travel to
              Maun, Botswana to consult with Dr. Lars Ramberg, Director of the Harry
              Oppenheimer Okavango Research Center.  The purpose of the visit is to finalize
              plans for the initiation of a cooperative, multi-disciplinary project to study
              the role of hippopotamuses in wetland ecosystems and their interactions with
              humans.  Hippopotamuses are a keystone species of the Okavango Delta, and many
              other animal and plant species are dependent upon them.  No systematic studies
              have been conducted on the hippopotamuses in the Okavango Delta, and it is
              anticipated that such a project will yield valuable information on their
              population biology and interactions with their environment.
