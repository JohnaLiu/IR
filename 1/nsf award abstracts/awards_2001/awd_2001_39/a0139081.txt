Abstract    :
              Georgia Tech operates a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site on
              structure-property correlations across length scales.  The program emphasizes
              team research in projects addressing characterization and modeling of
              deformation and fracture in metals, mechanical properties of nanocrystalline
              alloys, optically active nanomaterials, and processing and characterization of
              functional composites. Fifteen students are recruited every year for an
              eight-week summer research experience.  The program also includes the
              participation of six high school teachers every year. The teachers are part of
              the research teams and develop curricular materials such as demonstration
              projects on the research topics and computer-based materials modules. The
              teachers' participation is supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary
              Activities of the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
