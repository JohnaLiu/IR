Honeycutt

Dr. Honeycutt is awarded funds to establish a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates site in astronomy at Indiana University in
              Bloomington, Indiana. The site will host six students per year for three years.
               Recruitment will target students from small colleges and state universities
              without astronomy Ph.D. programs. The focus of the student projects will be
              observational stellar astronomy using ground-based photometric and
              spectroscopic data. The students will be organized into three research groups
              in the areas of variable stars, open cluster color-magnitude diagrams, and high
              dispersion spectroscopy. Student activities will include a week-long trip to
              Kitt Peak to use the 0.91-m WIYN (Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale-NOAO) telescope, an
              internal research symposium in the final week of the program, and the
              preparation of abstracts and posters for presentation at a professional
              meeting.
