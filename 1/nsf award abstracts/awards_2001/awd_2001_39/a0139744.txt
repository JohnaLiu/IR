Abstract    :
              This award supports the purchase of an transmission electron microscope (TEM)
              for the Laboratory for Ultrastructural Research, a central electron microscope
              facility operated by the Department of Biology at the University of South
              Florida (USF). The new instrument replaces an obsolete, 23-year old microscope,
              which is currently inoperable because spare parts are no longer available. The
              instrument will support the research programs of  four major users in the
              Department of Biology, three of whom have joined the institution in the last 2
              years.  Areas of investigation include viruses of marine invertebrates,
              attachment of marine algal ephiphytes, mechanical and structural properties of
              invertebrate eggs, and studies of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor translocator
              pathway in freshwater fish.  The TEM will be used for instructional purposes by
              USF graduate and undergraduate students on a regular basis, and also used on an
              occasional basis in a  course taught at the University of Tampa.
