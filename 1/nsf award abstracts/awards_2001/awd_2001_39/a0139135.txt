Abstract    :
              The River Basins Research Initiative (RBRI) NSF-REU Site, will incorporate 15
              undergraduate science majors at the sophomore or junior level into an extensive
              10-week interdisciplinary research program that is focused on the
              biogeochemistry of river systems in the upstate of South Carolina.  Nine of the
              students will be funded by NSF-REU and six will be funded jointly by NSF-REU
              and the Universidad metropolitana, San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The faculty involved
              in this program are from the departments of earth and environmental sciences,
              biology, and chemistry and have developed a moded system for interdisciplinary
              integration.  Students involved in the research will be introduced to a variety
              of analytical systems, work on interdisciplinary teams and participate in all
              phases of the research from planning, to sample collection, sample analysis,
              and data analysis.  The long-term goals of this research program are to
              quantify the extent of human impact on aquatic biota in the Lower Broad River
              Basin in the upstate region of South Carolina and to characterize
              biogeochemical cycles in a subtropical weathering regime.
