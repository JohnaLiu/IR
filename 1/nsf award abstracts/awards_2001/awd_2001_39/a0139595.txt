Abstract    :
               
This award provides funding to the University of Maryland-College Park for
              the support of a four-year, REU Site in Molecular and Cellular Bioengineering,
              under the direction of Dr. Timothy A. Barbari.  This ten-week summer program
              will involve eleven students annually in an intensive research program in
              bioengineering at the molecular and cellular level.  Each student work with
              full-time faculty, visiting scientists, post-doctoral research associates,
              graduate students, and other undergraduate students on research that promises
              to lead to important new discoveries and technologies.  They will be exposed to
              state-of-the-art research, multidisciplinary research laboratories, research
              group meetings, and scientists/engineers from local industry and nearby
              research institutions (NIH, NIST, USDA, FDA, NRL). In addition, the students
              will participate in non-technical seminars on the graduate school process,
              industrial field trips to nearby biotechnology companies, technical and
              presentation skills training.
