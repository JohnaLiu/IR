Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Florida. 
              Randolph Duran is the site's Program Director and Benjamin Smith is the
              Co-Program Director. Thirty faculty will serve as REU student mentors.  Over
              the award period (2002-2004), ten students will be supported each summer in a
              ten-week program.  In addition to the recruiting efforts used in the past, a
              partnership will be established with Tuskegee University to identify additional
              underrepresented minority students.  The students will live and interact with
              French undergraduate students, as part of their experience.  The research focus
              is a biological and materials chemistry.  Students will participate in weekly
              seminars and will present their research results in the form of papers, talks,
              and/or posters.  There will be a three-day weekend post-REU meeting and poster
              session each October after the program ends.  Students will be surveyed several
              times throughout the summer program and research mentors provide evaluations of
              each student at the conclusion of the program.  All students are tracked after
              the program ends.
