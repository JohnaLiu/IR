Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Santa Clara University.  Julie
              Mueller is the site's Program Director and Patrick Hoggard is the Co-Program
              Director. Eight faculty will serve as REU student mentors.  Over the award
              period (2002-2004), eight students will be supported each summer in a ten-week
              program.  The goal is that at least six of the eight students each year should
              be women and underrepresented minorities.  Students select research from among
              projects in organic, biological, and physical chemistry.  Ethical issues in
              scientific work will be examined through weekly meetings directed by ethicists
              from the Santa Clara University Markkula Center for Applied Ethics.  The
              Societal Dimensions of Engineering, Science, and Technology Program support
              this portion of the REU program.  Summer activities will end with a symposium. 
              A written evaluation by each of the students of the overall REU program will be
              provided at the conclusion.  Periodic surveys of all REU alumni will be done to
              assess the long-term impact of the program.
