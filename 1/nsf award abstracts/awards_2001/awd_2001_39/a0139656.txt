Abstract    :
               
This award provides funding to Louisiana State University (LSU) for the
              support of a three-year, REU Site in the Chemical Sciences, under the direction
              of Dr. Steven F. Watkins and Dr. Kerry M. Dooley. This is a renewal of a
              successful site for summer research in the chemical sciences and will result in
              the training of 42 undergraduate students (14 per year). The nine-week summer
              program is a joint effort by chemical engineers, chemists, and biochemists at
              LSU and offers a diverse cadre of students, who are drawn from all parts of the
              U.S., the opportunity to contribute in a meaningful way to well-funded, active
              research projects.  The REU site builds on past achievements, most notably that
              more than sixty percent of its interns haven chosen to attend top graduate
              schools in chemical engineering or a closely related discipline. The program is
              particularly successful in leveraging regional resources from industry and its
              emphasis on written and verbal communications skills through mini-proposals,
              final reports, oral presentations and posters.
