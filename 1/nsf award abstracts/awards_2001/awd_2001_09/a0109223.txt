Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Evolution of herbivore  defense
              strategies in an invasive plant."  The invasive weed Hypericum perforatum, L.
              (St. John's wort) is being used in this study of the evolution of defense
              strategies against insect herbivory.  The genetic basis of resistance and
              tolerance are being determined by developing a genetic map of resistance and
              tolerance traits, investigating tradeoffs between traits conferring resistance
              versus tolerance, and examining whether tradeoffs vary between native and
              introduced populations with differing histories of biological control.
