Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to join Power Systems
              engineering research center (PSerc) PSerc is a consortium of universities and
              industries, formed to collaboratively tackle critical power systems problems. 
              The inclusion of CMU in PSerc will benefit both institutions:  CMU has
              resources that will enhance PSerc's  problem solving capabilities, and PSerc
              will make it possible for CMU's researchers to work on problems that would
              otherwise be inaccessible to them.
