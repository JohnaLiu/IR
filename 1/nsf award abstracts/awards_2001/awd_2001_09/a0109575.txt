Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Prof. Alfred
              Redfield of Brandeis University will develop a sample shuttler for nuclear
              magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation studies using commercial spectrometers. 
              The sample shuttle probe will provide an approach to obtaining the magnetic
              field dependence of spin-lattice relaxation constants.  Thus, this new tool
              will provide a convenient way to separate dipolar contributions from chemical
              shift anisotropic contributions without the necessity of multiple NMR
              instruments.  

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution.   The completed shuttler should be
              broadly applicable and could be readily built in a university machine shop. 
              Thus NMR relaxation measurements, which are key to understanding complex
              biologically relevant molecules, will become much more common-place.
