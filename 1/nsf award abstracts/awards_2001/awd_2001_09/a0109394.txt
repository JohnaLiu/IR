Abstract    :
              International research interaction and exchange of ideas, particularly in the
              field of emerging technologies, is in the best interest of United States. 
              Several NSF-sponsored workshops have concluded that thermal issues play an
              important role in many of the critical areas.  NSF support is requested to
              partially support a team of US young scientists to visit India in January 2002
              to participate in the Fifth ISHMT-ASME Heat and Mass Transfer Conference
              (Calcutta), jointly sponsored by the Indian Society of Heat and Mass Transfer
              and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The US scientists will also
              visit several premier institutions including the recently-established Indian
              Institute of Technology, Guwahati, and Bangladesh. It will help in developing
              new ties with Bangladesh Society of Mechanical Engineers.  A diversified group
              of US researchers including graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and
              non-tenured faculty, will be partially supported from this grant, with special
              preference to under-represented groups. The visit will expand research
              interactions between the US and Indian scientists, build new contacts, improve
              our understanding of thermal science research and education in South Asia, and
              provide our young scientists with global perspectives of heat and mass transfer
              research.
