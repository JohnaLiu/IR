Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will lead to
              the development of compact, low cost gas sensors and analyzers based on cavity
              ringdown spectroscopy using near-infrared lasers manufactured for fiber optic
              communications. Although conventional cavity ringdown spectroscopy can achieve
              part per trillion detection limits for many gases (water vapor, carbon dioxide,
              ammonia), few commercial applications require such extraordinary sensitivity.
              Instead, price and reliability are controlling factors for the sensors and
              analyzers market. That is why we propose a modified form of ringdown
              spectroscopy that should lead to low cost, compact, and rugged instruments. The
              Phase I effort is designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
              technique which will lead to the development of a prototype instrument in Phase
              II.

Commercial applications include industrial process analysis and control,
              bioreactor monitoring, and worker safety. Ideally, the sensors and analyzers
              will be low power (possibly battery operated), self-calibrating and
              self-checking devices that will be sufficiently rugged to allow in situ
              installation.
