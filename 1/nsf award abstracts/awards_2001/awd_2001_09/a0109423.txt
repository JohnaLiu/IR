Abstract    :
              The purpose of the proposed study is to test two theoretical perspectives on
              decision-making - rational choice theory and symbolic interactionism - by
              examining the decision-making of flood victims to either remain in or relocate
              outside of the floodplain.  Federal agencies have shifted their approach to
              managing floodplain property from focusing on recovery efforts solely to
              developing proactive programs to protect people and property from being
              damaged.  One way that these agencies have attempted to break the cycle of
              development-destruction-redevelopment is through public acquisition of
              floodplain property (FEMA 2000, 1997).  While many of these buyout programs
              have been moderately successful, these programs hinge on individual homeowners
              deciding to participate.  Yet, a study of the decision-making considerations of
              this population has not been conducted.  This project seeks to fill that gap
              while advancing our understanding of the relative merits of rational choice
              theory and symbolic interactionism.
