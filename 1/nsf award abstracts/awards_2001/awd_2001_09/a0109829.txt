Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
              methods to prepare 60-200 base RNA/DNA oligonucleotides. Current methods for
              preparing long oligonucleotides suffer from limitations that hinder their
              application in biological science. Investigators have expressed an immediate
              need for longer material incorporating unnatural modifications and
              non-canonical substitutions. Access to these oligonucleotides is critical for
              continued discoveries in molecular biology and nucleic acid based therapeutics.
              Despite such demand, the most reliable synthetic method, 2-ACE chemistry, can
              provide quality oligonucleotides no longer than 50 bases. This SBIR Phase I
              project will use 2-ACE RNA to develop a novel biochemical technique using RNA
              ligase to enzymatically splice oligonucleotides together. RNA substrates will
              be coupled as part of a complex with a complementary splint. This project will
              evaluate different conformations of the ligation site, the tolerance of the
              enzyme for different substrate sequences, the optimal design and composition of
              the splint, and the ideal concentrations of substrates and cofactors. Once
              determined in an iterative process, the best conditions will be applied to more
              challenging research problems identified by collaborators. This research will
              directly address a critical deficit in the resources available to the national
              biotechnology research community.


The commercial applications of this
              project are expected to be varied and immediate. As example, site-specifically
              modified RNAs of 50-200 bases in length should be in high demand by
              investigators who are developing RNA-targeted drugs or other RNA-dependent
              technologies beyond the reach of current synthetic means.
