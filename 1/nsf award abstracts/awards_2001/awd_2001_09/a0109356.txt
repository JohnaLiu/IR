Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will demonstrate
              the feasibility of constructing a low cost process control sensor for advanced
              alternative energy and catalysis applications. Sensor could be a component in
              as many as 1.2 million fuel cell vehicles projected to be on the road in 2010
              and a component in the electrical generation market which could surpass $100
              Billion in 2010.  The sensor will measure carbon monoxide in the
              part-per-million to percent range in a wet, high concentration, hydrogen stream
              with significant carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N2) concentrations. 
              Although large nondispersive infrared (NDIR) instruments are the standard
              solution to this measurement problem, NDIR is prohibitively expensive for many
              applications including fuel cell power plants, and transportation applications,
              and quite expensive for industrial processes such as urea manufacture and oil
              refining.  Phase II will develop an easily manufactured sensor costing a few
              dollars apiece in large quantity as opposed to current IR systems costing
              thousands to tens of thousands of dollars apiece.

This project will have a
              direct impact on reducing United States dependence on foreign oil by making
              highly efficient fuel systems practical.
