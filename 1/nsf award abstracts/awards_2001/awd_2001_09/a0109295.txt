Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              yeast strains to efficiently catalyze the conversion of cellulose to ethanol. 
              Current technology requires the addition of purified cellulase enzymes to
              convert cellulose to glucose, which is then fermented to alcohol by the yeast
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The proposed research  intends  to make three
              significant improvements over the existing technology : (1) Use of a high
              temperature tolerant yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus to effect a very efficient
              fermentation, (2) Expression of genes encoding cellulase in the fermenting
              yeast, and 3) Isolation and selection of  the yeast and the cellulase genes
              from the cellulosic waste specifically for optimal performance.


The
              commercial applications of this project are in the reduction of cellulose waste
              material produced by agriculture and industry, and in the production of a cost
              effective fuel grade ethanol.
