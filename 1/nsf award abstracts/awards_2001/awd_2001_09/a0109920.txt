Abstract    :
              Professor Anne Kelley of Kansas State University is supported by the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to perform advanced spectroscopic
              studies of molecules with potential for good nonlinear optical responses.  By
              quantitatively simulating the absolute resonance Raman intensities and optical
              spectra of these species in solution,  the PI will experimentally determine the
              effect of solvent environment on the structures of both the ground and lowest
              excited electronic states of the molecules.   Neural networks will be tried for
              fitting experimental data to models.  The molecules will also be studied
              embedded in polymer matrices at 5K using single molecule emission spectroscopy.
              

It is important to be able to quantify the relation of optical and
              nonlinear optical responses to solvent effects, if these molecular structures
              are to be incorporated into polymer matrices to fabricate devices.  This work
              will improve our ability to convert sophisticated spectral data into predictive
              models for new optical materials.  Optical materials are needed for advances in
              optical computing and communications.
