Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will build a
              small form factor silicon chip antenna for radio frequency identification
              (RFID) applications in smart tags.  A new high-performance, low cost, small
              size silicon chip antenna, fabricated by wafer batch processing, will be
              combined with a standard, passive (no battery) RFID chip to form a low cost,
              high-performance RFID tag of small dimensions.  The antenna and the RFID chip
              are stacked directly on top of each other.  Phase I used a simplified process
              and scaled up structures.  In Phase II the process will be optimized, devices
              with the intended dimensions will be used, and the antenna chip and the RFID
              chip will be stacked.

Passive RFID systems are used in applications such as
              object tagging, asset  management, hazardous materials tracking, and tracking
              of important documents.  Existing RFID technology is limited by the need for
              large transponder antennas (~ 1 inch by 2 inch minimum) and costly
              multi-component assembly.  The silicon wafer batch processed antenna chip
              technology will produce millimeter-scale smart tags (programmable replacement
              for bar codes), enabling products for large commercial markets.
