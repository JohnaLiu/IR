Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop
              a novel high-resolution instrument, the Near-Field Cell Penetrating Microscope
              (NCPM), for analyzing and comparing molecular characteristics of cells. This
              instrument will adapt a Scanning Near-Field Optical Microscope (SNOM) with a
              probe that can penetrate the cell membrane and image the inside of intact
              cells. The hypothesis is that precancerous, cancerous and normal cell lines
              have different molecular profiles and can be differentiated with the resolution
              power of SNOM. The proposed instrument will be able to collect data via
              high-resolution imagery, thus providing the means to investigate tumor cells at
              the sub-cellular and the molecular level. Incorporation of this data into a
              signature will facilitate the molecular analysis of cell lines and their
              transformed counterparts. 

The near term commercial application of the
              product to be developed in this project is in the near field optical microscopy
              market as a research tool for the medical and biological community. The long
              term commercial application is in the medical diagnostic market as an early
              warning device for detection of diseased cells.
