Abstract

The Transformation Field Analysis
              (TFA) is a new method for hierarchical modeling of many interacting physical
              processes in heterogeneous material systems.  The  research, will provide the
              following new theoretical results and applications of the TFA: (a) A rate form
              of the influence functions and governing equations, for applications involving
              changes in thermoelastic moduli of the phases.  (b) Formulation of new shape
              functions for refinement of local inelastic deformation fields;  and  (c):  Use
              of unit cell models in the context of the TFA, for refined analysis of local
              deformation and damage processes.
