	Many societies in the world have flexible
              customs of child-rearing involving adoption and fosterage to match children to
              adults in specific situations.  This dissertation research by a cultural
              anthropology student will investigate the role of adoption and fosterage in
              rural and urban highland Peru.  Internal migrants from rural to urban areas who
              seek education, employment, or safety have used flexible child rearing methods
              for years.  The Peruvian government has recently begun a system of regulating
              and bureaucratizing domestic and international adoptions which transformed the
              ability of urban Andeans to develop their kinship networks through fosterage. 
              Over a period of 12 months of research with Quechua speakers in the Ayacucho
              region, the student will study how Andeans respond to the content of state
              discourse and policy about kinship ideologies.  Through participant
              observation, oral history and semi-structured interviews as well as a survey of
              400 residents of the rural community studied, she will examine the relationship
              between the content of official, state discourse about proper forms of
              family-construction and the understandings and practices of fosterage among
              rural community dwellers and internal migrants to the city of Ayacucho.  The
              general issue to be studied is whether rural models of kinship are amenable to
              change when they are confronted with state discourse, or whether models of
              kinship are so deeply embedded in Andean life that they resist changes
              encouraged by state discourse.  This project will produce valuable new
              knowledge for those interested in issues surrounding both domestic and
              international adoption, will advance our familiarity with this important region
              of the world, and will contribute to the training of a young social scientist.
