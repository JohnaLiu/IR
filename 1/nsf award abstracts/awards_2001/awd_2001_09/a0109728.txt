Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I (SBIR) project will develop a
              novel sensing coating that will be deposited on filters for the detection of
              water-borne contaminants. The initial target will be the oocysts of
              Cryptosporidium parvum, a water- borne pthogen. C. Parvum was responsible for
              the outbreak of cryptosporidiosis affecting 400,000 in Milwaukee WI in 1993 and
              other smaller outbreaks.
Cryptosporidiosis is characterized by abdominal pain
              and severe diarrhea, and can be fatal to immune-compromised individuals. There
              is currently no easy and reliable test for C. parvum that allows routine
              monitoring of drinking water supplies. The proposed research will develop a
              sensing polymer coating, with antibodies and fluorophores incorporated, on a
              nanoporous membrane. The membrane will be used as filter to simultaneously
              concentrate and detect C. parvum in water. Binding of C. parvum to the coating
              will lead to a fluorescent signal. The Phase I research will focus on antibody
              conjugation to the polymer, fluorophore incorporation, and coating preparation,
              with the aim of demonstrating the feasibility of the sensing material. In Phase
              II, the materials will be optimized and incorporated into a detector that will
              combine filtration and fluorescence detection for monitoring drinking water
              supplies.

The principal commercial application of this project will be for
              detection of water-borne contaminants in our drinking water supplies, with a
              potential market comprising of a majority of public water systems in the
              country.
