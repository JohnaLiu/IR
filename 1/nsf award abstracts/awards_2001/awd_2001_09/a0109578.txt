Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              novel photonic crystal defect cavity enhanced photodetector with wavelength
              selectivity, fast response speed, and low noise.  By introducing photonic
              crystals into the design of a cavity enhanced photodetector, the problems
              associated with lattice matched reflector growth, low refractive index
              contrast, and heterojunction charge accumulation will be avoided.  The photonic
              crystal defect cavity enhanced photodetector will be easy to fabricate and have
              superior performance compared with traditional detectors.  The design can be
              expanded to photodetector arrays in many materials systems.  Phase I will
              investigate the fabrication of photonic crystal defect cavity, characterize the
              photonic crystal band structure, and test p-i -n photodetector structures.
              Phase II would produce the prototype photodetector devices and optimize their
              performance. 

Novel products utilizing a photonic crystal defect cavity
              enhanced photodetector are anticipated in optical communications and
              telecommunications.  Since silicon (Si)-based photodetectors can be easily
              incorporated into Si-based integrated circuits, there will be immediate
              commercial application to the telecommunications industry.  There is also long
              term potential application in imaging and optical communications.
