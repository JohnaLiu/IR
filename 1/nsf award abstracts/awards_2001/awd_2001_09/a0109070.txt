Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a
              rapid and reliable method for inducing, detecting and recovering isotypic
              switch variants in hybridoma cell lines using in-vitro switching media, gel
              microdrop (GMD) technology and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).
              Antibodies are widely used in research and clinical applications. Antibodies of
              the IgM subclass are generally considered the least useful due to their
              pentameric structure and lack of affinity for protein A and protein G which
              makes purification and modification of IgM antibodies difficult, and enzymatic
              digestion for Fab fragment production almost impossible. Many of the hybridomas
              produced, however, are of the IgM subclass. IgM producing
hybridomas do,
              however, spontaneously switch the subclass of antibody they produce to IgG,
              although at very low frequencies. Currently there is no simple method for
              controlling class switching and isolating class switch variants. Several
              protocols have been developed to effect class switching of IgM producing
              hybridomas and to isolate class switch variants, but these procedures are
              lengthy and very labor-intensive involving multiple screening cycles. By
              providing a rapid method for isolating IgG switch variants, the GMD method will
              significantly improve bioprocessing of monoclonal antibodies for research and
              therapeutic use.

The commercial application of this project will be in the
              development of monoclonal antibody products for research, therapeutic,
              diagnostic and imaging purposes.
