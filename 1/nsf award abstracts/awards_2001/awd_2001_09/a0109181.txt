This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project addresses the need for cost effective water treatment.  Ultraviolet
              (UV) light treatment for chemical contaminants in water is attractive because
              contaminants are destroyed, unlike adsorption techniques that transfer the
              contaminant to a different media. However, the use of UV is limited by
              electricity costs for lamp power.  This project uses a newly developed Surface
              Discharge (SD) UV lamp with UV efficiency three times higher than the industry
              standard mercury UV lamp, which will reduce electricity costs. Furthermore, the
              shorter wavelength UV spectrum of the SD lamp can both increase destruction
              rate and reduce the amount of chemical oxidant additive. Project objectives are
              to optimize lamp operation, to demonstrate the advantages of the SD lamp to
              treat atrazine and nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), two contaminants of national
              concern, and to establish commercial feasibility.  A successful Phase I will
              establish the feasibility of a water treatment process based on the SD lamp,
              and will lead in Phase II to a prototype system and to commercialization in
              Phase III.


The near term commercial applications of this project will be
              in the large  water treatment market that includes groundwater, industrial and
              municipal wastewater, drinking water and general disinfection
