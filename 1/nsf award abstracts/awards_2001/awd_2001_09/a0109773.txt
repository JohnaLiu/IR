Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves a novel
              technique to fabricate full-color organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays
              in a cost-effective manner. The proposed scanning localized evaporation
              methodology (SLEM) circumvents the need for using elaborate substrate
              patterning and large vacuum chambers (to attain film uniformity), currently
              employed to manufacture OLED flat-panel displays (FPDs). 

The benefits of
              SLEM over current fabrication methodologies stem from its parallel processing
              of various layers, as opposed to sequential techniques. Dedicating a SLEM head
              to a particular material, multiple evaporating heads are integrated into a unit
              that yields full-color OLED displays in a single pass. Current projections
              indicate that using this technique, deposition time for growing all layers for
              a 3"x4" OLED display (consisting of an array of 270 360 pixels) is estimated to
              be in the range of 3 to 7 minutes. Considering the wastage in material supplies
              and equipment infrastructure needed for conventional OLED processing, dedicated
              SLEM units would provide significant cost advantages in manufacturing OLED
              displays for various applications. SLEM represents a natural evolution of
              thermal evaporation that incorporates many features of ink-jet printing. This
              will naturally allow the production of inexpensive, larger and flexible OLED
              displays to claim a significant share of the FPD market.
