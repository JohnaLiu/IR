Abstract    :
              Dr. Kenneth B. Eisenthal of the Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, is
              supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the Division of
              Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work on the utilization of the
              Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) technique to probe interfacial dynamics in
              such processes as molecular transport through bilayers as a function of
              composition, molecular orientation in bilayers, solvation dynamics and charge
              transfer across a bilayer membrane. 

These studies will have a high impact
              and provide new insights into transport of molecules across membranes that will
              have a great impact to the medical community (for example, in drug delivery
              issues), to the biochemical and biology communities, and to the physical
              chemistry community with regard to ultrafast femtosecond phenomena. Students
              and post-doctoral associates will be trained in a unique area that encompasses
              chemistry, biology, and biochemistry.
