Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I (SBIR) project will
              investigate the feasibility of utilizing nanoscale molecular self-assembly
              methods to synthesize high performance optical fiber-based humidity sensors for
              breathing diagnostics. NanoSonic proposes to use molecular-level electrostatic
              self-assembly (ESA) processing methods to form multilayered, interleaved metal
              nanocluster and polymer thin films on the ends of optical fibers. Initial
              studies have shown that these small, robust and safe optical fiber sensors
              respond to humidity over a wide range of relative humidities, with a response
              time of milliseconds or less. All of these factors overcome current significant
              limitations in the fabrication of breathing monitors for clinical
              diagnostics.

The commercial applications of this project will be in clinical
              research and in home health care management.
