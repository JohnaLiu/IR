This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              will develop micromachined 
fluid handling components as part of a new
              technology platform for high throughput protein crystallization and the
              collection of single crystal x-ray diffraction data. As increasing effort is
              directed toward proteomics and high throughput protein
structure
              determination, the data derived from the determination of 3-D protein
              structures
will have enormous impact in such areas as protein engineering,
              recombinant DNA technology and gene therapy. This project proffers a simple
              design for an inexpensive device, a Microfluidic Protein Crystallization Chip
              (MPCC), that possesses a high-density array of vessels, each with fluid inlets
              and vents, and a design for simple on-chip two-way valves. Methods are proposed
              to rapidly prototype new designs with design modifications made on the order of
              a day. The MPCC will be able to dose solutions appropriate to run commercial
              screening matrices. Since the device will be on the order of 1 mm thick,  x-ray
              data will be collected by simply placing the crystal-containing MPCC device
              directly into the x-ray beam, thereby abrogating the expensive labor and
              equipment intensive exercise of isolating several micron sized crystals from
              20-100 nL of mother liquid.


The commercial applications of this project
              will be in the Structural Genomics market.
