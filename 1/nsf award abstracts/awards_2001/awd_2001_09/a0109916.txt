	The resilience or vulnerability of children in developing
              countries is the outcome of many factors beyond a simple measure of income and
              economic development. This research involves a cultural
              anthropologist-demographer studying the complex social position of children
              under twelve in rural northern South Africa in order to identify the social
              factors contributing to their well-being. The project will concentrate on a
              third level of social organization, between households and the community,
              consisting of the social connections that link members of different households,
              the flows of resources, services and assistance across these connections. The
              project builds on six years of annual demographic and health survey data
              conducted by the Agincourt Health and Population Programme.  Combining three
              months of intensive fieldwork in twelve groups of households in varying
              communities with analysis of data on 67,000 persons over six years, the
              researcher with his South African collaborators will test hypotheses that
              social networks are critically important resources for child welfare in this
              population.  This new knowledge will be useful to health planners in the
              developing world, and will allow modifications of future censuses and survey
              questions to identify important social relationships. In addition the project
              will elucidate general principles of child welfare and social networks that
              could be used to develop situation-specific indicators of social connection in
              other research sites.
