Abstract    :
              This proposal requests a grant of 43.500 in student support of the 2001 Gordon
              Research Conference on Nonlinear Optics and Lasers to be held at the
              Colby-Sawyer College, New London, New Hampshire. July 29 - August 3, 2001. The
              field of nonlinear optics and lasers has been and continues to be an extremely
              active and fruitful area of both basic and applied research. Recent Nobel
              Prizes in laser cooling, femtosecond chemistry, and laser diodes attest to its
              impact on science. The recent explosive growth of the telecommunications
              indusiry attest to its impact on our economy and also our daily lives. As in
              previous years. the purpose of this conference is to provide an informal forum
              for the presentation and discussion of new work on selected topics in nonlinear
              optics, quanium electronics and lasers, and their applications to physics,
              chemistry and engineering, both in academe and in industry. An informal
              atmosphere with a strong emphasis on discussion and interactions is intended to
              encourage the exchange of ideas in a manner not possible at regular meetings of
              professional societies. Students in particular benefit from these
              opportunities. A total attendance of approximately 100 scientists and students
              from universities, industry and government is anticipated. Participation at the
              conference is limited to under 135. to preserve the informal atmosphere and
              increase the level of interactions. It is proposed that the estimated total
              expense for the conference of $30,000 be shared by the National Science
              Foundation (43,500), the funds supplied by the Gordon Conference ($19,000). and
              funds to be solicited from other sources ($7,500). The National Science
              Foundation funds will be used to support selected graduate students who,
              because of limitations of their own sources of funding, require financial
              assistance to attend the conference. No honoraria will be paid to speakers at
              the conference.
