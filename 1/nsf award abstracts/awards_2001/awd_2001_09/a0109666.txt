Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I (SBIR)  project will apply Multi
              Photon Detection (MPD) to quantify the minute amounts of proteins contained in
              and secreted from a single cell. The successes of genomics have led to the need
              for improved knowledge of the protein content of cells (proteomics). The
              elucidation of all proteins requires better methods for the study of low
              abundance proteins because the majority of "molecular switches" are expected to
              be expressed at less than 10,000 copies per cell. The
goals of this project
              are to further improve the sensitivity of the MPD-enhanced immunoassays down
              to
the level of a few zeptomole/sample, to study intracellular processing of
              the important family of cytokines (IL-1, IL-18) and to study the levels of
              caspases in a single cell.

The commercial applications of the technology to
              be developed in this project are in the rapidly expanding proteomics market,
              especially in the area of low abundance proteins proteomics. This market is
              currently estimated at around $ 200 million and expected to grow severalfolds
              over the next few years.
