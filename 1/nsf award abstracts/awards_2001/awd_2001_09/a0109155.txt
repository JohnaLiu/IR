	The contemporary world if full of cases of ethnic
              violence, where people who have been neighbors for years, if not generations,
              turn to violence.  Theories explaining such conflict have addressed ancient
              animosities, political manipulation (especially during turbulent transitions to
              democracy), and competition for scarce resources. This dissertation research
              project by a cultural anthropology student will test these theories against the
              ethnographic reality of Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, where clashes between two
              groups, the Felupe and the Fula, resulted in violence and forced removal of
              families from the community. Through participant observation, structured
              interviews, household surveys and archival research, the student will explore
              the definition of cultural differences in inter-ethnic contexts; the modes of
              mobilizing ethnic solidarity; and the dynamics and trajectory of recent
              outbursts of ethnic violence.  The relative importance of kinship, inter-ethnic
              marriage, land tenure, religious affiliation, initiation and socialization, and
              cross-national ethnic alliances will be studied. The new knowledge to be gained
              form this careful case study will be valuable to theorists of contemporary
              ethnic conflict and will advance our understanding of this important region of
              the world. In addition the project contributes to the training of a young
              social scientist.
