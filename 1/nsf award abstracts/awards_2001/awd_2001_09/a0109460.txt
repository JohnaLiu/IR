Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              mid-infrared (IR) quantum cascade lasers based on type-II indium
              arsenide/gallium anitmonide/aluminum antimonide (InAs/GaSb/AlSb) quantum well
              structures.  These lasers emit radiation in the mid-IR region, enabling
              commercial products in fields including chemical sensing, medical diagnostics,
              and industrial process controls.  The wavelength of Sb-based quantum cascade
              lasers can be tailored over a wide spectral range due to the large conduction
              band-offset between InAs and AlSb.  In addition, because of the band-gap
              blocking in type-II quantum well structures, electron injection efficiencies
              near 100% can be achieved without requiring Bragg reflector layers.  Another
              advantage of this material system is the small electron effective mass in InAs,
              contributing to reduced phonon scattering rates.  Hence, the inter-sub-band
              quantum cascade lasers based on type-II InAs/GaSb/AlSb quantum well structures
              are excellent candidates for compact, reliable, efficient mid-infrared light
              sources operating at room temperature.  Phase I will involve the design,
              molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth, characterization, and optimization of
              InAs/GaInSb/AlSb quantum cascade lasers to demonstrate their feasibility of
              operation at low threshold current and at ambient temperatures (or at
              temperatures accessible with a thermoelectric cooler).  High performance mid-IR
              quantum cascade lasers would be developed in Phase II.

The first mid-IR
              semiconductor lasers are expected to operate under continuous wave (cw)
              conditions at ambient temperatures.  This would enable commercial products in
              several fields including chemical sensing.  One example is detection, at the
              parts per billion (ppb) level, of formaldehyde and related compounds for
              medical diagnosis purposes.  These laser sources will potentially find other
              commercial and defense applications.
