Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematical Sciences and Center for Applied Mathematics 
and
              Statistics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology will 
purchase an eight
              node (sixteen processor) Alpha Beowolf cluster which 
will be dedicated to the
              support of research in the mathematical sciences. 
The equipment will be used
              for several projects, including in particular:

1. What lessons from small
              neuronal networks apply to larger ones? 
   Victoria Booth, Amithaba Bose, and
              Farzan Nadim.

2. Numerical solutions of mixed functional differential
              equations
   Christopher Elmer.

3. Time-dependent oxygen transport from
              microvascular networks
   Daniel Goldman.

4. Pattern formation in thin
              liquid film flows
   Lou Kondic.

5. Full numerical simulation of
              microwave-enhanced chemical vapor 
   infiltration processing
   Burt
              Tilley.
