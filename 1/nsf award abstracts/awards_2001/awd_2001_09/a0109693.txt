Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              the feasibility of fabricating a carbon nanotube based field emission device
              (FED) and of operating FEDs.  The approach is a natural extension of the
              patented Nanotube Catalyst Retaining Structure (NCRS) method.  Phase I is
              expected to overcome limitations that have prevented FEDs from successful use
              in the established liquid crystal display (LCD) market and to initiate a broad
              range of other applications that require growth of aligned carbon nanotubes as
              functional elements of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).  This new concept
              in nanotechnology will be useful in application of carbon nanotubes as
              functional elements of integrated circuit (IC) and MEMS devices involving a
              multi-layered structure of metal, insulator, and carbon nanotubes.

Potential
              commercial applications are expected in field emission displays, electron
              microscopes, illumination devices, sensors, and similar devices.
