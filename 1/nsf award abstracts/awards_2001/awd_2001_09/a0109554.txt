Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves the
              development of a catalyst to control NOx emissions from combined cycle power
              plants using natural gas fired turbines (natural gas fired power plants). 
              During the Phase I effort, Guild Associates developed an environmental catalyst
              for the control of NOx emissions using NH3.  Operating in the presence of
              excess (about 20-33%) NH3, the catalyst was able to achieve greater than 95%
              NOx reduction without NH3 slip.  NH3 slip is avoided because the catalyst is
              able to simultaneously reduce the excess NH3 to N2 and H2O.  The objective of
              this project is to modify the catalyst developed during the Phase I effort in
              order to enhance its commercial viability.  Enhancing the commercial viability
              will involve increasing the reactivity of the catalyst and eliminating platinum
              metals from the formulation.  Enhancing the reactivity will allow the catalyst
              to operate at higher space velocities. Eliminating platinum metals from the
              formulation will greatly reduce the cost of the catalyst.  Successful
              completion of this effort will result in a simple, low cost technology for
              control of NOx emissions from natural gas fired power plants without NH3
              slip.

Potential Commercial Applications include the control of NOx emissions
              from natural gas fired power plants. Other commercial applications include
              controlling NOx emissions from semiconductor manufacturing, fine and specialty
              chemical manufacturing and nitric acid manufacturing processes.
