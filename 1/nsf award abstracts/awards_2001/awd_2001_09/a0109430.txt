Abstract    :
              

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to
              develop commercially viable methods for the fabrication of high aspect ratio
              micro- and nano-structures for microfluidic applications using contact
              nano-printing.  X-ray lithography will be used to produce molding tools to
              emboss structures in polymers. Microfluidic channels will be fabricated with
              ordered arrays of micro- and nano-posts filling these channels. Molding tools
              will be constructed from metal electroform to allow hot embossing or injection
              molding of various polymers. Mechanical properties of both the electroform and
              the polymers will be evaluated for the ability to minimize structure
              deformation during demolding. Various gluing and heat annealing assembly
              methods to enclose the microfluidic channels will be investigated. A number of
              post geometries will be examined for feature integrity during molding,
              demolding and assembly. Fluid transport through the ordered arrays will be
              studied in detail using confocal fluorescence microscopy.

The commercial
              applications of this project will be in the area of micro-column separations
              such as for reversed phase chromatography and for micro-reactors.
