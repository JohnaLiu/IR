Does peer review science insure that science is of interest
              only to "peers"? Is peer reviewed science performed by mission oriented
              agencies (e.g. EPA, USDA & USGS) of interest only to employees of the agency or
              their disciplinary mission? Is the scientific curiosity of university faculty
              of interest to anyone other than the curious faculty member?  Questions, such
              as the above, have been and continue to be asked by the public and their
              elected representatives as society faces increasingly complex water management
              decisions and science seems incapable of providing relevant input.

UCOWR is
              proposing to organize a day-long series of sessions at its 2001 annual meeting
              in Utah to examine past and current management method enployed to plan, review,
              and conduct water research as well as evaluate the relevance of water research
              findings to society's need for new knowledge to support increasingly complex
              water management decision-making.  A Water Resources Update issue will be
              produced from the day-long sessions as well as a summary dialogue paper for the
              dialogue section of the journal of the American Water Resources Association and
              /or EOS.
