Abstract    :
              Evidence supports the following view of meiotic recombination in yeast:
              Double-strand-break repair is governed by two pathways, which are distinguished
              by the products of resolution of their repair intermediates.  One pathway (Type
              I) yields the crossover and noncrossover resolution types expected from the
              cutting of both Holliday junctions of the intermediate.  The other pathway
              (Type II) yields only one of the two types of crossover resolution that could
              arise from cutting DNA strands in the intermediate, along with a single
              noncrossover type that appears to arise without strand cutting.  Crossover
              resolution of Type II intermediates depends on a set of proteins demonstrably
              required for crossover interference.  Crossover resolution of Type I
              intermediates occurs independently of these proteins, and Type I crossovers
              display little or no interference.  
	These studies of interference in yeast,
              which are expected to yield findings applicable to mammals and green plants as
              well, promise to provide an explanation for documented differences in
              crossing-over in yeast as compared with Drosophila.  In so doing, they will
              enhance our understanding of meiosis, an essential feature of sexual
              reproduction. Understanding this basic biological process will enable
              biologists to develop better solutions to many of society's most pressing
              problems
