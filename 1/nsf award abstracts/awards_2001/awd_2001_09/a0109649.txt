Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              develop the hardware implementation of a novel image compression/signal
              decomposition algorithm based on the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). This
              fully parallel, low-power, scalable, multi-resolution implementation is
              particularly well suited for use in reduced bit-rate applications over wireless
              communication channels as found in the next generation of web enabled cell
              phones. This particular implementation is a highly efficient implementation of
              the wavelet transform and makes use of a novel overlap state wavelet
              decomposition algorithm that minimizes both memory usage and interprocessor
              communication overhead.  Over the next decade, spiraling consumer demand for
              fast mobile communication of voice and IP over increasingly integrated
              terrestrial and satellite-based radio systems plagued by a limited
              electromagnetic spectrum allocation necessitates the pursuit and development of
              better compression algorithms at low bit-rates.

As a consequence of
              extensive research, transform-coding techniques has come to virtually dominate
              every single image and video coding scheme proposed to-date. Consequently,
              efficient software and hardware based transform coding system designs and
              implementations have become a high priority objective at both
academic and
              commercial research centers.
