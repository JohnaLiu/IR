Abstract    :
              The Gordon Research Conferences on a number of scientific topics, are held every
              summer to discuss recent findings and current thinking in various areas of
              science. Although participation is limited, the attendees usually consist of
              established scientists, young investigators who are making important
              contributions in these areas, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students.  The
              meetings are usually held in small isolated New England towns away from other
              distractions, and are conducive to the free exchange of ideas.  These
              conferences have a recognized value for presenting the latest advances in
              research and also for indicating the future trends in research which are likely
              to be most productive.  This award represents full or partial support of 21
              conferences in the biological sciences being held in the summer of 2001 through
              the spring of 2002.
