This award supports fundamental theoretical research to study the
              new dilute quantum gas systems which have been made possible by recent
              experiments at JILA and MIT. Projects include studying the physics of Bosons
              and Fermions in scalar and spinor limits (i.e. in magnetic and optical traps),
              the physics of mixtures of quantum gases, many-body effects in optical lattices
              and in the fast rotating regime, and the dynamics in the strongly interacting
              limit, i.e. near the Feshback resonance.

This grant supports theoretical
              research to study a wide range of physics in new dilute quantum gas systems
              which have been made possible by recent experiments at JILA and MIT. These
              experiments have, for the first time, been able to create a new state of
              matter, the Bose-Einstein condensate, which was predicted many years ago. The
              PI will investigate a wide range of phenomena in these dilute quantum gas
              systems. The emphasis will be on fundamentally new aspects of these systems,
              effects of strong interaction, many-body effects and possible applications.
              This award also supports graduate level education in condensed matter
              theory.
