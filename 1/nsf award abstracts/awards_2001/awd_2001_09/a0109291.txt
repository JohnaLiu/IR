Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              the feasibility of fabricating low volume, low parasitic, i.e., low series
              resistance and inductance, high energy density capacitors using stacked,
              thin-film tantalum pentoxide dielectrics fabricated on Kapton film and tantalum
              foil.  Low resistance capacitors will shorten both charge and discharge time,
              as well as lower the resistive load on the battery or power source.  Low
              inductance is also important in high voltage systems.  Power supplies have high
              transformation ratios with many turns for secondary windings that induce high
              leakage inductance.  Therefore, capacitor inductance must be minimized in order
              to reduce the total system inductance, ultimately improving power usage factors
              and system efficiency.  

Numerous high power systems are used in the
              medical, defense, space, and consumer electronics industries, where substantial
              reduction in size and weight and increased speed and performance are desired. 
              Special anodization techniques used to form capacitor dielectrics will allow
              fabrication of capacitors with a wide range of high performance configurations
              and characteristics that are expected to benefit all of these industrial
              markets.  Miniaturized, high energy density thin-film capacitors are used in
              many high power devices, such as defibrillators, DC power supplies, and
              automotive electronics.
