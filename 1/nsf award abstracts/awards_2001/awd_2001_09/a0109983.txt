Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will investigate
              production of an exciting new material CuWRAM (Copper Waste Recovery from
              Aqueous Media).  Evaluation of these pilot procedures will support the design
              of full scale manufacturing facilities.  A processing system utilizing the
              patented ISEP separations hardware obtained from Calgon Carbon Corp. and CuWRAM
              as the extractant material for copper extraction and separation from iron (III)
              will be produced. Extensive testing will provide information to: (1) establish
              the effectiveness of the CuWRAM - ISEP system on real samples; (2) establish
              the economic feasibility of this system under various conditions; and (3)
              develop a targeted marketing strategy based on the first two items. Results
              from the Phase I project have generated excitement throughout the mining
              community. Initial testing on actual mining solutions will be conducted with
              one of the largest copper producers in the U.S. 

Commercial applications for
              a CuWRAM copper extraction include use in the primary extraction circuit of
              copper mining operations, recovery of copper for reuse in copper plating
              processes and recovery of copper from remediation projects.
