Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project, A High Power,
              High Efficiency W-band Amplifier, is a new W-band, high-power microwave source.
               A point design based on a frequency of 11.424 gigaHertz (GHz) at the input
              cavity produces a one megawatt output at 91.4 GHz.  It has a 51.5% system
              efficiency and 57.9 decibel (dB) gain. Phase I will make a detailed analysis to
              establish credible estimates of radio-frequency power, pulse length, emittance,
              efficiency, gain, and other key parameters.  This W-band amplifier will provide
              a high power, high-frequency source suitable for many applications, such as
              improved tracking and mapping in atmospheric and near-atmospheric
              studies.

Benefits will accrue to:  (1) High resolution planetary mapping
              studies using inverse synthetic aperture radar, affording an improved signal to
              noise ratio at short wavelengths; (2) Cloud physics studies with greater range
              at improved resolutions; and  (3) Space debris detection and tracking of near
              earth asteroids with improved accuracy.
