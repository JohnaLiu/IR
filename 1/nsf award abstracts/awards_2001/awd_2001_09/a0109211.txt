Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled ""Functional aspects of Dbl
              homology proteins as molecular switches in cell signaling."  Communication
              within a cell is vital for the maintenance of normal cellular function. 
              Studies being conducted are aimed at deciphering the basic molecular aspects of
              function and regulation of a Dbl homology protein, a vital component in
              cellular signaling.  These studies are aimed at determining the general
              mechanism of function using structural, biochemical and cell-based approaches.
