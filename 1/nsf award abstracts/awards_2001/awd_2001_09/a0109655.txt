Abstract    :
              Joseph Templeton, Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina at
              Chapel Hill, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
              Chemistry Program to continue his studies of fundamental reactions of ligands
              coordinated to transition metals. One focus of this grant involves tungsten
              complexes with coordinated carbynes or carbenes. Complexes such
              asTp'I(O)W=C(CH3)(OSiR3), where Tp' represents a tris-pyrazoyl borate, are
              unusual examples of "Fischer-type" carbenes bound to a high oxidation state
              metal. Studies will probe the bonding and reactivity of these species. Another
              focus of the grant is the synthesis of organometallic complexes of Pt(IV)
              relevant to carbon-hydrogen bond activation.

Fundamental studies of the
              electronic structure and bonding of these ligands provide insight into
              important heterogeneous catalytic processes. In addition, graduate students and
              postdoctoral associates will learn valuable skills in synthesis,
              characterization and reactivity studies.
