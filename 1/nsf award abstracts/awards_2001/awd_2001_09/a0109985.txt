Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
              state-of-the-art Revenue Management (RM) application suite that addresses
              inventory allocation and supply-chain management issues.  RM, a new way of
              approaching the supply/demand concept, is best understood as the set of actions
              leading to revenue maximization by efficiently utilizing the available
              perishable resources.   In Phase I a software prototype was developed based on
              highly optimized inventory allocation algorithms that produced 2-5% revenue
              improvements over algorithms used in practice.  Phase II has a two-fold
              objective:   to advance the software and produce a state-of-the-art RM
              application suite to be used in the airlines, hospitality and equipment rental
              industries; and,  to add new components that address supply management
              decisions interconnected with the inventory allocation decisions addressed in
              Phase I.

RM is currently applied primarily to the airlines and (to different
              degrees) to cruise lines, hotels, car rental companies, energy, entertainment
              industry and telecommunications. It is widely acknowledged that companies that
              neglect to implement RM techniques to maximize their revenue will risk becoming
              uncompetitive.  Therefore, there is a large potential market for a flexible
              state-of-the-art RM suite built on highly sophisticated algorithms.
