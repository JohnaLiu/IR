Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore a
              low-frequency positioning system for locating and tracking people inside of
              buildings.  Phase I will establish system feasibility by showing that lower
              frequencies will not be subject to the guided-wave propagation modes caused by
              typical indoor structures of hallways, partition walls, and floors.  These
              guided-wave modes can cause unacceptably large errors in indoor positioning
              systems.  The concept will be validated by a combination of electromagnetic
              modeling and experiments.  It is expected that a phase-only, low-frequency
              approach will produce high accuracy and good penetration into buildings with
              modest bandwidth requirements and minimum problems for licensing approval.
              

The principal commercial application is in the firefighter market.  The
              system will monitor not only a firefighter's position but also vital biometric
              data, e.g., pulse, respiration, temperature, air tank level.  Further, this
              system will be portable, obviating the need for a supporting infrastructure. 
              It can also be used for tracking prison guards and rescuers entering a
              collapsed building after an earthquake or other natural disasters.  Hospitals
              could use this technology to track critical mobile equipment or personnel.
