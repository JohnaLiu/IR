Abstract    :
              
The Mechanisms of Eucaryotic Transcription conference will be an open
              international meeting devoted to the most recent advances in the rapidly
              evolving field of eucaryotic transcription. This meeting follows six highly
              successful meetings on the same topic held in Cold Spring Harbor in 1989, 1991,
              1993, 1995, 1997, and 1999, and will be organized according to the same basic
              format. The meeting will be open with attendance limited only by the facilities
              available to a maximum of 450 participants.  Oral presentations will consist of
              a combination of invited presentations and selected presentations from
              submitted abstracts. This ensures the participation of junior and senior
              leaders in the field and the presentation of the most exciting results emerging
              at the time of the meeting. The oral presentations will be complemented by
              poster presentations in three poster sessions, also selected from submitted
              abstracts.  The areas covered by the meeting include studies on 1) central
              components, 2) persistent effects on the template, 3) chromatin, 4) regulatory
              complexes I, 5) regulatory complexes II, 6) activation mechanisms, 7)
              regulatory pathways, and 8) promoter opening, clearance and elongation. A
              number of eucaryotic systems including mammalian systems, Drosophila, nematode,
              and yeast will be represented.

Gene transcription, the process by which the
              information in a gene is converted into a mobile form for use by the cell, is
              an essential process in all living things.  This meeting will help disseminate
              current research findings on this vital topic and will stimulate and facilitate
              further advances.
