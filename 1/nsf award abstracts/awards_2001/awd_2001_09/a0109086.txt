     The principal investigator and his colleagues study
              the
structure and function of real-world networked systems,
particularly but
              not exclusively social networks.  An empirical
component is concerned with the
              discovery and analysis of the
structure of networks, including networks of
              collaboration
between scientists, networks of company directors, networks
              of
personal preferences, and networks of citations between
              academic
publications.  Studied quantities include local observables such
as
              transitivity and degree distribution, and nonlocal ones such
as centrality and
              community structure.  The investigator develops
models to aid in the
              understanding of the effects of network
structure.  Of particular interest are
              random graph models of
networks, percolation models of network resilience, and
              models of
epidemics taking place on social networks.  The
              investigator
develops new algorithms for extracting and visualizing
              network
structure, particularly the existence of communities in networks
and
              structural properties related to network resilience, such as
path counts and
              centrality measures.
     A knowledge of the structure of networks of
              acquaintance is
crucial to the understanding of how information, such as
              news,
rumors, consumer trends, etc., spreads through society.
Similarly,
              networks of physical contact between people govern the
way in which diseases
              spread.  A proper understanding of the
nature and progress of epidemics is
              impossible without good
network models.  In this project the investigator
              determines what
the structure of the networks in question is, and also models
              the
effect of that structure on, among other things, the spread
              of
information and disease.  As well as enhancing basic
understanding of
              these problems, the project points to ways in
which network structure or
              dynamics can be changed in order to
either improve network transmission (in
              the case of information)
or slow it down (in the case of epidemics).  For
              disease
transmission, for instance, it may be able to suggest
              effective
targets for immunization or education campaigns to slow
              disease
spread.  The new data resources and analysis techniques developed
can
              be used to study other problems in which network-structured
processes
              arise.
