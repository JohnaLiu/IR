This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I
              project will develop new thermostable bacteriophage and archaeaviral DNA
              polymerases for  use as improved reagents for DNA amplification, sequence
              analysis and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection.  This will be
              accomplished by direct isolation of thermophilic bacteriophage and archaeaviral
              genomes from hot springs, construction of expression libraries and screening
              for novel thermostable DNA polymerase activities.  The proposed approach is
              expected to be significantly more rapid and comprehensive than traditional
              approaches that have been used for  enzyme discovery.  These traditional
              approaches rely on the limiting intermediate step of culturing a microbe and
              its cognate virus. In contrast, the proposed approach on this project will
              allow screening of all expressible viral DNA polymerases present, including
              those from unculturable phage that is believed to predominate in the
              environment.

The primary commercial application of this project will be in
              the marketing of novel thermostable DNA polymerases to organizations involved
              in genomics research for use as improved reagents for specific molecular
              biology methods.
