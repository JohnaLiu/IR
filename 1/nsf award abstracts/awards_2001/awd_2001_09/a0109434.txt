Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I (SBIR) project seeks to develop
              simulation software for teaching evolutionary biology. Evolution is the core
              subject in biology, yet it requires concepts and ways of thinking that are
              challenging for most students. Moreover, it is a subject that is poorly
              understood by many non-scientists, with important consequences on the way
              science is taught in public schools. This project will lead to the development
              of a  very flexible piece of software that allows users to design evolutionary
              simulations and students to graphically see evolution in action. The software
              will be accompanied by a set of classroom-tested laboratories teaching a
              variety of evolutionary topics. Students will learn by designing and performing
              their own experiments.

The commercial potential of this project is immediate
              and obvious. To date, a good, general purpose teaching program of the type
              proposed in this project is not available and the market is very large,
              consisting of virtually every secondary school and college in the country.
