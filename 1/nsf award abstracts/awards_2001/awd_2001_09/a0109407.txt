Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              investigate a proprietary method of measuring atmospheric temperature starting
              at 10 meters above the surface. Our concept, if successful, will overcome the
              current Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS) low altitude and temperature
              resolution limits. The temperature measurement accuracy will be increased by at
              least a factor of two. This system will support research by providing a
              continuous low altitude temperature profile for a better understanding of the
              atmosphere and improved weather prediction. Localized weather forecasts are
              particularly important for airports predicting fog, air quality control,
              controlled burns of grasslands and forests, and uncontrolled forest fires. The
              ability to predict the behavior of the smoke emanating from these fires is
              important since it is a threat to many segments of the population.

Results
              from this research could provide accurate low altitude temperature profiles to
              businesses that need local weather data (airports, fire departments, television
              and radio stations, air quality control, and disaster management of nuclear or
              chemical mishaps, etc.).
