Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to
              demonstrate how a radically new technology can be applied to real-time
              detection of food-borne pathogens. Current ready-to-eat food inspection test
              methods require 3-6 days due to the need to enrich the pathogenic population to
              the point to make them detectable. During this time, the food is stored,
              awaiting the results of the tests. This method necessitates additional expenses
              and resources to store and track the tested lots and reduces the market
              shelf-life by as much as a week. With the proposed approach, detection of
              pathogens can be done in real-time as part of the food processing work flow.
              This is possible because of an innovative technology involving the use of a
              proprietary amplifying polymer that greatly amplifies detection events. This
              polymer has been shown to detect subfemtogram masses of inorganic compounds. In
              the proposed research, proven methods of identifying Listeria will be coupled
              to the amplifying polymer, resulting in a highly sensitive detection mechanism
              that will eliminate the need to grow enriched cultures.

The immediate
              commercial application of  this project will be for the inspection of
              ready-to-eat foods that are subject to Listeria contamination. The low cost and
              convenience of the system will be attractive to in-plant quality control
              inspectors, government regulators and institutional users. The broader
              applications of the basic sensor platform would be for detection of other food
              borne pathogens and of pathogenic releases in laboratories and in the general
              environment.
