Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design,
              fabricate and test parallel coaxial evanescent microwave probes (EMP) with
              integrated piezoelectric actuators and neuromorphic electronics.  EMP is being
              developed and commercialized by MICC in collaboration with researchers at Case
              Western Reserve University for a variety of imaging applications including thin
              film quality control, semiconductor characterization, biological studies, and
              other applications in metrology.   EMPs have very fast scan rates (>1 cm/s) and
              they yield information regarding the dielectric constant as well as the
              microwave conductivity of materials. They are also non-contact with the
              capability of imaging both conducting and insulating materials. Integration of
              actuators and neuromorphic electronics with EMP's will enable their development
              in manufacturing quality assessment and other high throughput applications. 
              

EMPs have very high spatial resolutions (=0.1 um -100 um and in some cases
              atomic resolution) and their application in manufacturing will have significant
              impact on quality control and assessment. The possible market for such a system
              is in multi-billion US dollars per year in the US alone. The proposed parallel
              EMP arrays will be tested using a mock pulsed-laser deposition set-up at MICC.
