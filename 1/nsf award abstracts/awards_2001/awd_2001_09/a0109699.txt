Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will examine the
              feasibility of culturing naturally occurring bacterial consortium that exist in
              coal seams. These bacteria generate the bulk of the 450 million cubic feet of
              methane now being recovered daily from coal seams in the Powder River Basin of
              Wyoming.  However,  only indirect studies have thus far been carried out on the
              character,  environment, and activity of these organisms.  Isolating the
              bacterial consortium will allow development of methods to detect critical
              parameters for biogenesis in the field and to determine conditions under which
              this biogenesis may be optimized.

The commercial application of this project
              is in detection of new methane rich coal seams and in enhancement of methane
              production from existing coal seams.
