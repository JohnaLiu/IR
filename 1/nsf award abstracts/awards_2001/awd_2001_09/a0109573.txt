Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore an
              improved process of manufacturing Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) wafers.  The SOI
              process includes:  (1) forming a hydrogen-rich buried layer in a donor silicon
              wafer;  (2) prebonding the donor wafer to a handle wafer;  (3) cleaving the
              donor wafer along the buried layer to thinner top silicon; and  (4) postbonding
              and surface smoothing of the final SOI wafer.  An initial wafer is oxidized
              allowing it to get the buried oxide of SOI.  A new feature is an improved
              activation of wafer surfaces to be bonded.  Activation is termination of
              surfaces with either hydrogen or with hydroxyl groups.  Preliminary results
              show that the terminated surfaces contain more than a monolayer of hydrogen.
              And the excessive adsorbed hydrogen causes transfer faults during subsequent
              layer transfer.  The Phase I activation process allows control of the hydrogen
              dose.  The process uses radio frequency plasma treatment instead of wet
              processing.  It is expected that the yield of the SOI process will be
              increased.

The new process will be used in the silicon wafer market, which
              currently totals $10B annually.  Estimates indicate that SOI wafers will
              increase to around 20% of this market within 10 years as SOI is one of the few
              solutions for production wafers based on less than 0.18 micron design rules.
