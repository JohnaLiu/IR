Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research  (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
              a prototype instrument for measuring harmful bi-products of chlorination in
              drinking water. These disinfection bi-products are subject to EPA regulations.
              The Phase I project demonstrated that the concept of differential UV absorption
              measurement, i.e. absorption before and after chlorination, is suitable for the
              needed measurement. A pre-production prototype instrument will be constructed
              during the Phase II project. This device shall employ a multi-pass cell design
              using our novel dual-ratio technique that eliminates concerns about long term
              drifts. The overall instrument architecture design and systems design will be
              carried out prior to assembly of the full microprocessor-controlled  recording
              device. Extensive laboratory and field tests will be used to review design
              changes before production.

The potential commercial applications of the
              instrument proposed may be used in the
laboratory or in-line at utilities. The
              market for the proposed product is quite substantial as EPA regulations will
              result in the installation of such devices at all utilities and drinking water
              facilities.
