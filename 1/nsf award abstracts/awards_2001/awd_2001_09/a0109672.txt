This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              seeks to develop a low cost,
disposable microfluidic manifold that includes a
              micropump for lab-on-a-chip (LOC)
applications. The microfluidic devices will
              be engineered for integration with disposable
chemical and biological LOC
              detector systems. The key objectives in this Phase I project are : (1) to
              construct and to test a proof of principle system, (2) to assess the
              compatability of the technology for an array of LOC applications, (3) to design
              an integrated microfluidic system, and (4) to determine specifications of the
              Phase II prototype. 

The commercial applications of this project are
              expected to be in a broad range of markets, extending from specialty medical
              industries to general consumer products. Examples of commercial devices that
              may potentially incorporate this technology include chemical analysis systems,
              drug delivery systems, MEMS actuator systems and embedded health monitoring
              systems.
