Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Genetically defining the
              non-dividing state of the cell."  It has been debated, for cells that have
              stopped growing, whether they have simply paused in their growth cycle or
              whether they have entered a physiologically different state, referred to as G0.
               To distinguish between cycle arrested and G0 cells, this research is using
              microarray analysis on growth arrested cells of the year, Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae.
