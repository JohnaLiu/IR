Abstract    :
              This postdoctoral research and training project seeks to understand the
              relationship between human rights, their abuses, and the health status of
              Haitian workers in the Dominican Republic. The social scientific literature on
              the status of Haitian workers' well-being does not often illuminate the health
              status of this population. Likewise, medical literature regarding health and
              disease among Haitian populations does not elucidate the broader socioeconomic
              context which helps structure health outcomes. Given the documented abuse of
              Haitian workers in the Domincan Republic, what are its likely impacts upon the
              health status of these workers? A study of Haitian workers presents an
              opportunity to examine in detail the pathogenic effects of social inequalities
              on this often unprotected population. This project has three objectives: 1) to
              assess the living and working conditions of Haitian cane cutters who reside on
              bateyes (shanty town dwellings) and Haitian workers in other sectors of the
              economy, 2) to evaluate the health status of these workers vis-a-vis these
              conditions, and 3) to correlate health status with gender, legal status, class,
              Spanish-speaking proficiency, and type of work on or off the bateyes.
