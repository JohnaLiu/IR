Abstract    :
              A joint U.S.A. - Itlay Symposium on Composite Materials in the summer of 2001 is
              proposed that will involve young investigators in this area as well as mature
              leaders in the field.  This symposium, to be based in Capri, Itlay, was the
              place for the first NSF sponsored joint U.S.A. - Italy Composite Symposium 20
              years ago by the coauthors.  This award will provide partial travel support for
              investigators who would not otherwise be able to attend this binational
              conference.
