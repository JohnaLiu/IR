Abstract    :
              Linda Peteanu of the Carnegie Mellon University is supported by the Theoretical
              and Computational Chemistry Program to study complex condensed molecular
              systems using Stark spectroscopy.  The ability to engineer complex molecular
              systems such as polymers, dye-polymer complexes and aggregates to specific
              applications depends on a thorough understanding of how their electronic
              properties are impacted by their structure and the surrounding media.  Stark
              spectroscopy can address the magnitude of electronic changes in these systems. 
              The PI will continue investigations into these issues by studying cyanine dyes
              complexed with DNA as well as conducting polymers.  Moreover, she will add
              single molecule techniques to overcome problems of heterogeneity in the Stark
              measurements.

Optical responses of complex media such as dye aggregates and
              conducting polymers are important to understand for advances in sensors and
              nanotechnology.
