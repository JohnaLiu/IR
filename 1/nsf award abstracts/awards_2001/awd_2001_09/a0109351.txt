Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address
              improved wafer contamination analysis in the microelectronics industry.  Phase
              I will examine a new technique called focused beam total reflection x-ray
              fluorescence (TXRF).  Based on point-focusing toroidal crystal optics, focused
              beam TXRF is expected to improve spatial resolution by a factor more than 100
              and provide 30 times better detection sensitivity for local contaminants on
              silicon (Si) than the conventional TXRF method. This technique also has
              potential for low level aluminum (Al), sodium (Na), and other low atomic-number
              (Z) elements that not performed effectively by conventional TXRF and other
              techniques.  Phase I will demonstrate improved sensitivity and resolution for
              transition metal detection.  Theoretical calculations will be also carried out
              to determine the feasibility for Al and Na detection in wafer contamination
              control.

Focused beam TXRF analysis has commercial applications in the
              microelectronics industry for wafer contamination control, including localized
              and homogeneous contaminants with high resolution.  These contaminants include
              many important elements, such as transition metals, Al, Na and other low Z
              elements.
