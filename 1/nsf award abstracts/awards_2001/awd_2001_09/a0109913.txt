Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
              compact, all-solid-state, pulsed drivers coupled with solid-state protection
              circuitry for powering laser diodes/diode arrays and increasing their
              reliability and lifetime.  New high-current semiconductor switch technology
              will be coupled with proprietary new diode protection circuits featuring
              fault-mode detection and high-speed current limiting to extend laser diode
              lifetime tenfold.  This leads directly to a tenfold reduction in annual laser
              operating cost.  Recent breakthroughs in high power semiconductor technology,
              namely the 
Gate Commutated Thyristor (GCT)  switch, also offer significant
              improvement in speed, power, and compact size over existing commercial devices.
               Phase II will develop advanced, compact pulsed power modules based on these
              technologies. 

GCT technology,  coupled with a proprietary fast protection
              circuitry, offers a significant decrease in diode laser system size and weight
              and a tenfold decrease in laser cost-of-ownership made possible by increased
              diode lifetime.  New commercial applications for the diode-pumped solid-state
              lasers are expected to include powering diodes for optical telecommunications
              and ultraviolet and X-ray point sources for Next Generation Lithography in the
              semiconductor industry, as well as in laser cutting and welding.  Medical uses
              for this new fault-protected, solid-state driver technology will include
              oncology and gene therapy.
