Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase 1 Project (SBIR) will contribute
              towards the development of a near-instantaneous, all-optical biosensing
              technology to replace ELISA-type (enzyme-linked immunoadsorbant assay) assays.
              Utilizing the unique optical properties of Metal Nanoshells, a new type of
              nanoparticle containing a dielectric core coated with a thin metal layer,
              immunoassays can be performed in the near-infrared region of high physiological
              transmissivity (wavelengths between 800 and 1300 nm) using Surface Enhanced
              Raman Scattering techniques. The equipment required to perform this immunoassay
              will be both highly portable and inexpensive. Initial research with a model
              antigen has shown that the nanoshell-based assay can produce results on
              whole-blood samples in 20 seconds. This is quantitatively equivalent to ELISA
              results requiring 24 to 48 hours. The proposed research will investigate the
              effects of bioconjugation of clinically important antibodies onto the nanoshell
              surface and examination of multiple Raman dyes for multi-antigen/analyte assays
              .

The primary commercial application of the technology being developed in
              this project is in  the $20 billion immunoassay market.  The proposed research
              could lead to rapid immunoassay devices for ambulances, military and civilian
              health agencies, point-of-care analysis and high volume pharmaceutical testing.
              The core technology may have additional commercial applications in the area of
              biochips, in genomics and proteomics research, and in animal biology
