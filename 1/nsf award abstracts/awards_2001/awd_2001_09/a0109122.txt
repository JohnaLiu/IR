The investigators propose to estimate the
              contribution of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in transport to the support of
              stream ecosystem metabolism. The specific objective of this project is to
              estimate the mass flux of DOM (e.g., the rate of flux from the water column to
              the streambed), to represent this as the sum of fluxes from several lability
              classes, and to characterize the respective concentration and uptake length
              coefficient of DOM in each lability class. Uptake length converts easily to
              mass transfer coefficient or turnover rate through scaling relationships
              involving depth and water velocity. Quantifying the uptake of natural DOM in
              the stream is analogous to describing the uptake (or spiraling) of phosphorus
              or ammonium, but is complicated by the diversity of natural DOM (i.e. it
              consists of an array of compounds of varying lability), and the fact that
              isotopically-labeled natural DOM is not available. This project will use
              13C-labeled DOM generated by growing plants in a 13C atmosphere. The
              longitudinal uptake of 13C -DOm will be resolved into multiple uptake lengths
              (corresponding to multiple lability classes), estimated as the sum of
              exponential-curves. In addition, the uptake kinetics of natural (12C) DOM in
              laboratory bioreactors will be compared to those of the labeled 13C-DOM, and
              this comparison will be used to scale the results of the 13C-DOM injection, to
              appropriately describe the uptake of natural DOM in the stream.
