Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will design a
              prototype for a rapid-deployment, three-dimensional (3-D), seismic reflection
              system for shallow subsurface exploration. Although the 3-D seismic reflection
              method enjoys tremendous commercial success in marine applications, 3-D seismic
              systems for land-based geophysical exploration have been limited because
              cost-effective and environmentally friendly deployment systems have not been
              developed. Such a system would be useful to build models of ground water flow,
              track pollutants, identify mineral-laden zones, and aid the siting of large
              construction projects. The customer base for this seismic reflection system
              includes civil and environmental engineers and geophysical contractors.

PFM
              Manufacturing and Montana Tech propose to design a rapid-deployment, 3- D,
              seismic reflection system that employs multiple land streamers with
              gimbal-mounted vertical geophones. An industrial, low-impact All Terrain
              Vehicle (ATV) is a critical part of the system both to pull the land streamers
              and minimize environmental impact.  PFM builds an ideal ATV for this purpose.
              The primary advantage of such a system is that fewer field personnel would be
              needed compared to conventional surveys and data could be collected more
              efficiently.
