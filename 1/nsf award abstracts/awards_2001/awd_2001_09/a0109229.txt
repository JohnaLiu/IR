Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Understanding how membrane
              proteins involved in sporulation reach their proper locations." All cells can
              target proteins to specific locations, but the mechanism for this process is
              poorly understood in bacterial systems.  During sporulation in Bacillus
              subtilis, many membrane proteins are specifically localized within the cell to
              division sites.  Through mutant analyses and fluorescence microscopy using GFP
              fusions, this research is gaining a more detailed picture of how bacteria send
              proteins to specific regions of the cell.
