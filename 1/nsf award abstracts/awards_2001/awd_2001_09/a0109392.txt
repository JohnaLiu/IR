Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              new type of residual gas analyzer based on a novel ion-trapping concept.  The
              new instrument will have significant cost and size advantages over current
              commercially available residual gas analyzer (RGA) systems.  If the concept is
              successful, it has the potential to provide performance capabilities exceeding
              current RGA technology.  The new trap also has potential application as a
              general purpose ion source for precision mass spectrometry.  
Phase I will:
              (1) design and construct a proof-of-principle experiment to demonstrate the
              novel ion trap as an ion source for a compact RGA; (2) conduct experiments to
              characterize the performance of the new instrument; and (3) evaluate possible
              extensions of the instrument and develop the conceptual design for a Phase II
              laboratory demonstration instrument.

These new RGA instruments are expected
              to reduce capital and manufacturing costs in industries such as semiconductor
              manufacturing, vacuum coating, electro-optics, chemical processing, and
              environmental monitoring.  It will also make RGAs more available to new users
              in industry and university research laboratories, who presently cannot afford
              such instruments.
