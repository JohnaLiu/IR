	This dissertation research project in cultural
              anthropology studies the effects of markets and household wealth on the
              extraction of resources from the tropical forest in the Brazilian Amazon. 
              Combining theories and methods from microeconomics, economic anthropology and
              cognitive anthropology, the student will test hypotheses relating household
              wealth, income, extractive activities, market integration, and knowledge of
              forest resources among a sample of rubber tappers in the Chico Mendes
              Extractive Reserve of Acre, Brazil. Although previous studies examined the
              effects of wealth and markets on household livelihood strategies, this project
              advances our understanding by studying these factors in an extractive reserve,
              where livelihood strategies are limited; it also advances studies in cognitive
              anthropology by relating intra-cultural variation in rubber tapper knowledge of
              forest resources to the economic factors that contribute to shape livelihood
              strategies.  The project will examine changes over time, comparing research
              findings from 1996 with current data, to provide policymakers a yardstick for
              measuring change in the reserve.  This new knowledge will be valuable for
              creating policy in other tropical forest protected areas.  The project also
              advances our knowledge about this important region of the world, and
              contributes to the training of a young social scientist.
