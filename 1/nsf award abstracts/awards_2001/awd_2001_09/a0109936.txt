Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to identify bottlenecks in heterologous protein
              production from transgenic plant cell suspensions, and to develop genetic
              strategies to overcome these limitations.  Three model proteins will be
              studied.  These include, hepatitis B surface antigen, Norwalk virus capsid
              protein, and human secreted alkaline phosphatase.  These proteins will be
              studied in two host systems, i. e. tobacco and soybean suspension cultures. 
              The Principal Investigators (PIs) will test the hypothesis that transcribed
              mRNA may have increased opportunities for translation in the late
              exponential/stationary phase as compared with the exponential growth phase due
              to competition with endogenous mRNA for translational machinery.  If this is
              true, then inducible expression during the late exponential growth/stationary
              phase might lead to higher product levels.
