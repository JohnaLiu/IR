This dissertation research by an anthropology student
              from the University of Washington will gather and analyze data on western
              Torres Strait (Australia) Islander marine resource use, in order to evaluate
              two competing models of human use of natural resources. Optimal foraging theory
              predicts that defendable territories of limited access are likely to produce
              conservation-oriented behaviors, such as foregoing the harvest of marine
              animals based on individual size or local population depletion. An alternative
              view of small-scale human society holds that people are often socially invested
              in conserving future stocks without regard for specific territorial rights. 
              Hypotheses from these alternative theories will be tested in this research,
              using measurements of catch, patch time allocation, and return rates.  The data
              and will contribute to an enhanced understanding of the microecology of
              fishing, and will be useful for localized and cooperative management
              institutions to provide them with a stronger basis of effective management of
              coastal resources.  The project in addition contributes to the training of a
              young social scientist, and advances our understanding of this important region
              of the world.
