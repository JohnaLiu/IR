Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              optical amplification in a single-mode polymer optical fiber.  Phase I will: 1)
              incorporate various rare earth chelates into polymer systems; 2) demonstrate
              amplification in the material; 3) make a polymer fiber with a rare-earth core;
              and 4) demonstrate amplification in the fiber.  Single mode polymer optical
              fiber waveguides will be made with a mode profile that matches that of standard
              silica glass fiber, thus making the amplifier fiber compatible with existing
              fiber-optic components.  

Besides applications in phased array radar, these
              amplifiers are expected to impact the long-haul fiber amplifier business, but
              it's largest impact will be in small and regional network applications,
              particularly for fiber-to-the-neighborhood and fiber-to-the-curb uses. The new
              technology will also impact the amplifier market for local intranets, as well
              as provide cost-effective amplifier solutions for small networks and hybrid
              fiber-coax cable TV systems.
