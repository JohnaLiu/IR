Abstract    :
              This is a study of the mechanisms of formation of soot. Shock-tube experiments
              designed to clarify he importance of several hypothesized pathways for single-,
              double-, and multiple-ring systems are performed. Two different shock tubes are
              used: a single-pulse, high-pressure shock tube with species analysis by
              sampling and gas chronstography/mass spectrometry, and a "low pressure" shock
              tube equipped for laser schlieren and laser flash absorption analysis. Systems
              studied include the decomposition of 1, 5-hexadiyne, recombination of propargyl
              radicals, reactions of benzyne generated by pyrolysis of phthalic anhydride,
              and the chemistry of diacetylene and diacetylene/acetylene mixtures including
              formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Elucidation of ring
              formation pathways and the quantification of related kinetic parameters over
              wide range of temperature and pressure leads to improved models of soot
              formation.
