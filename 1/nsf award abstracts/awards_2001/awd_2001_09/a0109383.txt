The Principal Investigator's overall objective is to study the
              biosynthesis of novel types of polyhydroxyalkanoic acids (PHA), which are
              spatially structured and, therefore, confer specific physical properties to
              this material. The microstructure will be achieved by periodic alteration of
              the nutrients supplied to the microorganisms that are capable of PHA synthesis.
              The different nutrients result in the formation of different precursors for the
              polymerization reaction and lead to the controlled deposition of homo- and
              copolymer in spherical granules with architecture structured at the nanometer
              length scale. Furthermore, the nutrient switching strategy can be designed to
              generate structure at the individual polymer chain level resulting in
              block-copolymers that can self-assemble into specific morphologies that could
              have useful physical properties. This biosynthesis approach will be further
              developed to generate specific diblock- and tailback-copolymers and their
              physical properties will be evaluated. In addition to the synthesis of such
              PHAs with improved value, the biosynthesis of this material will be
              investigated in the context of anaerobic metabolism of the yeast Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae extending preliminary studies that demonstrate that anaerobic
              biosynthesis of PHAs is possible. The combined effort of producing 'smarter'
              materials of higher value together with metabolic engineering manipulations of
              the organisms for more efficient production processes could have significant
              impact on the technology of biodegradable plastics.
