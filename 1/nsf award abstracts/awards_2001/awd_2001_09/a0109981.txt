Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an
              economically competitive, novel, catalytic process for low temperature
              hydrocarbon partial oxidation.  An innovative process for ethylene epoxidation
              will be developed as a commercially significant application.  Most
              heterogeneous hydrocarbon partial oxidation reactions utilize engineered
              catalysts, which incorporate novel promoters to enhance selectivity. However,
              reactor heat management significantly impacts process energy efficiency,
              catalyst selectivity, and ultimately, process profitability.  The Phase II
              project will develop an innovative process for hydrocarbon partial oxidation
              which addresses these issues.  In Phase I, technical and economic viability of
              the novel process was demonstrated.  The Phase II project will focus on the
              intrinsic reaction kinetics, heat transfer, and mass transport.  A continuous
              ethylene epoxidation process will be demonstrated at the bench-scale and small
              pilot-scale in novel, three-phase reactors. In addition, an engineering process
              design and cost analysis will be developed.

The commercial application from
              this project will be the heterogeneous hydrocarbon partial oxidation, if
              successful would greatly increase raw material and energy efficiency as well as
              increase process profitability in the chemical and petrochemical industries.
