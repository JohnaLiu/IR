Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
              the problem of chlorinated solvent contamination in saturated, low permeability
              soils.  The specific objectives of Phase I research are : (1) to quantify the
              effectiveness of chitin as an electron donor facilitating reductive
              dechlorination and enhancing bioavailability of tetrachloroethylene (PCE and
              TCE); ( 2) to incorporate chitin into a delivery system designed for low
              permeability soils;  and (3) to evaluate the delivery method in the field. 
              Preliminary studies have shown that chitin may be an ideal candidate to
              facilitate low cost, low maintenance bioremediation of chlorinated solvent
              residual sources.  Obtained as a byproduct from the shellfish industry, chitin
              is particularly attractive as it is very commonly available.  If favorable
              results are obtained during Phase I column and field studies, then a follow on
              Phase II project will further examine mechanisms controlling process efficiency
              and longevity.

The commercial applications of this project will be  in the
              multi-million dollar bioremediation market.
