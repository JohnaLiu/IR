     The investigator and his colleague study the
              relation
between bifurcations in neural dynamics and
              electrophysiological
features of neurons.  There is growing understanding of
              the role
of bifurcations in neuron dynamics.  Indeed, knowledge of
              all
bifurcations in a neuron model can explain some features of
neuron
              activity, such as the existence of oscillatory potentials,
synchronization,
              bursting, excitability, etc., without knowing
electrophysiological details. 
              However, there is little
understanding of the relationship between
              electrophysiology and
bifurcations in neural dynamics.  For example, why do
              certain
ionic currents or combinations of them result in an
              Andronov-Hopf
bifurcation but not a saddle-node on limit cycle
              bifurcation?
(These two types of bifurcations describe
              Hodgkin's
classification of excitable neurons.)  Over 100 different kinds
of
              recognizable bifurcations result in bursting patterns of
activity.  A key
              question is whether or not one can determine for
a given type of bursting
              activity what combinations of ionic
currents must (or must not) be involved. 
              The investigator and his
colleague introduce here a notion of minimal
              electrophysiological
models classified by voltage gated, second messenger
              gated, and
variable Nernst potentials.  They map this classification onto
              the
existing classification of bifurcation mechanisms in neuron
dynamics. 
              This yields a deeper understanding of nonlinear
dynamics of
              electrophysiological systems.
     How does a brain encode and process
              information?
Mathematics has played an important role in studies of
              this
problem to date by creating methods for analyzing results
obtained by
              life science and medical researchers.  There is a
well-developed
              electrophysiological theory of how neural tissue
can sustain and propagate
              electrical activity using ionic
currents.  At the same time there is an
              emerging mathematical
theory based on canonical models of bifurcations, which
              are
observable changes in a biological preparation in response
              to
stimulation.  This project brings these two lines of inquiry
together by
              classifying dynamical systems (mathematical
structures) in terms that are
              consistent with electrophysiology.
The result is a deeper understanding of
              nonlinear phenomena in
electrophysiological systems.
