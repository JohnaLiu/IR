Abstract    :
              This proposal is to fund travel to a workshop in San Francisco, March 12-13,
              2001, on the subject of digital preservation and digital archiving.  The
              workshop will identify and stimulate pilot projects in the collectin
and use
              of born-digital information, build agreement on guidelines for servicing and
              use of born-digital material, and write a white paper on the role of
              born-digital resources in research libraries, including an outline of next
              steps and identification of the individuals and organizations that could take
              them.  It will improve our understanding of how to use digital information for
              long-term societal benefit.
