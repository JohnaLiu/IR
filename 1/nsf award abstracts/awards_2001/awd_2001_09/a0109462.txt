Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I (SBIR) project will use
              ink-jet printing technology to fabricate precision biodegradable microspheres,
              20-200m in diameter, for sustained-release of bioactive substances. The
              microspheres will be fabricated at specific diameters, as determined by the
              application, thereby producing an excellent platform for delivery of drugs,
              hormones, growth factor, DNA vectors / plasmids, cytokines, and enzymes. For
              the initial application, the microspheres will incorporate antineoplastic
              agents, such as taxol, for the treatment of head and neck cancer. The physical
              parameters of the microspheres will be verified with a scanning electron
              microscope. Release kinetics profiles of the taxol loaded microspheres will be
              determined by in vitro pharmacokinetic modeling. Quantification of
              antineoplastic agent release will be performed by High Performance Liquid
              Chromatography. Retention of efficacy will be tested by first fabricating the
              taxol microspheres and then extracting and testing the antineoplastic agent in
              a cell culture model of squamous cell carcinoma. The intact microspheres will
              also be tested in a nude mouse model of human squamous cell carcinoma.

The
              commercial applications of this project will be in human therapeutics as an
              alternative to conventional administration of those drugs that have a short
              half-life or that cause considerable systemic effects.
