A grant has been awarded
              to Drs. Weiner and Hutcheson of the University of Maryland to investigate the
              genetics and cell biology of insoluble complex carbohydrate (ICP) degradation
              by an unusual marine bacterium, Microbulbifer degradans.  This bacterium was
              isolated from the Chesapeake Bay watershed and has the ability to degrade
              almost all known biological polymers, including ICP's, by forming unusual
              surface structures.  These surface structures appear to be organized consortia
              of enzymes that allow the bacterium to efficiently degrade and process these
              very stable polymers.  The degradation of such ICP's is not governed by
              conventional enzymology; the most efficient degradation involves contact with
              organized consortia of enzymes.  Never before has any single organism been
              reported to have the capability to degrade such a broad spectrum of ICP's.  It
              is also the only microorganism shown to degrade an ICP other than cellulose by
              this mechanism and the first observation of this degradative mechanism in an
              aerobic bacterium. This grant will fund research to understand what genes and
              proteins are involved in the degradation of the ICP, agar, and to determine how
              the agar-degrading structure is assembled on the bacterial surface. 
              

Knowledge of the genetics of this system should provide new tools for the
              processing of complex carbohydrates into useful byproducts and for
              bioremediation of the billions of tons of agricultural, aquacultural and
              algalcultural waste generated each year that contain very stable ICP's.  In
              addition, little is known about how the annual production of the more than 25
              billion tons of ICP's produced in the world's oceans are recycled into the
              biosphere. Thus, this research has potential applications in bioremediation
              and/or processing of waste products and could provide valuable insights into
              evolution of bacteria and the ecological role of this marine bacterium in the
              carbon cycle.
