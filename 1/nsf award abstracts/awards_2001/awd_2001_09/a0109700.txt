Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I (SBIR) project will test
              Cesium Iodide cluster ion beams as an alternative to lasers for desorbing
              bioions from a MALDI ((Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization) matrix.
              This offers the possiblity of performing the post source decay tandem mass
              spectrometry on an event by event basis, making possible the application of
              coincidence techniques which allow specific correlations to be made between
              metastable parent ions and their ionic fragments. This is an anaolgy to what
              has already been demonstrated for 252Cf fission fragment plasma desorption mass
              spectroscopy of bioions. Thus post source decay becomes a true MS/MS technique.
              There is also the possiblity that the use of cluster ions can increase the
              fragmentation and the degree of metastability of the desorbed bioions compared
              to using a laser. If so, the cluster deorption technique may be more suitable
              than lasers for imaging biomolecules on materials such as polymers or tissue
              slices. This Phase I project proposes to develop a cheap and reliable cluster
              ion source for MALDI. At the conclusion of Phase II, this ion source could be
              combined with a curve field reflector TOF mass spectrometer and marketed as a
              new approach to post source decay measurements.

The commercial applications
              of this project will be in the area of biomolecular mass spectrometry.
