Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              the feasibility of using a new type of adaptive receiver as part of a low-cost
              laser ultrasonic inspection system for manufacturing inspection and process
              control.  The test of feasibility will be very high detection sensitivity,
              while maintaining the capability to compensate for mechanical vibrations and
              atmospheric turbulence that are present in the factory environment.  High
              sensitivity helps to reduce power/energy requirements for lasers used in an
              inspection system and thus to reduce overall production costs.  The cost of the
              receiver, itself, will also be lower as a result of simplicity of design. 
              Phase I will develop analytical models to describe receiver performance,
              characterize receiver experimental performance, and evaluate a laboratory
              prototype eceiver.

There is a broad need for low cost sensors for many
              manufacturing applications.  Laser ultrasonic inspection can be used to inspect
              hot and/or rapidly moving parts and to scan large structural panels.  Systems
              cost reduction is expected to justify laser ultrasonic inspection over a wider
              range of manufacturing applications.
