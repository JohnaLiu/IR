Abstract    :
              The State Leadership Center (SLC) is proposing to move forward with its
              collaborative venture fto foster the use of research in support of state
              policies that aim to advance systemic educational  reform  and improvement. 
              Dr. Arthur Sheekey, the principal investigator, will continue to work with a
              team of state educational technology directors and a team of highly-qualified
              researchers to achieve the goals as stated in the original proposal to the
              National  Science Foundation (REC 0000509).  As a member of the SLC's 
              professional staff, he will assume responsibility for developing and
              field-testing an instrument process for helping states in examining statewide
              policies for educational technology and determining whether or not the
              respective state poloicies complement and reinforce the state's goals to
              achieve standards-based reform and improvement.  The  principal objectives for
              the initial phase of this project (December 1999 - December 2000) involved the
              identification of a set of critical related to state educational technology
              decision-making and to engage a cadre of researchers that could communicate
              efrectively on what states need to know about what works and under what
              conditions.  The product of out efforts to date is to draft assessment
              instrument - a CCSSO State Policy Chart, which is designed to assist teams of
              state officials to determine the extent to which state policies and investment
              strategies for technologies and telecommunications are strengthening curriculum
              officers and student achievement.  The objective for the next or upcoming phase
              of the project, January 2001 - April 2001, will involve a critique and
              validation of the proposed Policy Chart [See Attachment] and assessment
              process.

A long-term goal for this proiect is to incorporate and customize
              technology assessments into the ongoingStandard/Benchmarking reviews that are
              conducted by the Council's State Leadership Center.  The SLC presently works
              with all states involved in the processes  of changing and upgrading
              performance statards for teachers.  Recent  reports from states indicate that
              virtually all states are attempting to broaden and deepen the disciplanary and
              pedagogical  knowledge of teachers, ijmproving their ability to deliver more
              challenging and difficult courses of instruction, paraticularly, courses in
              science, mathematics, and technology that are available to all students. 
              Recent reviews of the states' five-year plans to attest to the fact that states
              recognize the integration of technology as a critical element for achieving
              higher performance standards.  However, state officials need statewide
              practices and investment strategies.  State policymakers want to know what
              legislative mandates, regulatory requirements and administrative directives are
              most likely to stimulate institutional reform and renewal.  As advanced
              telecommunications infrastructures emerge and as virtually all schools and
              classrooms are "wired,"  state officials increasingly are directing their
              attention to human issues.

By concentrating on policies and programs
              relating to teachers, the SLC is responding to one of the most pressing
              concerns of states:  ensuring the quality of the next generation of classroom
              teachers.  The SLC is committed to helping state officials to learn and share
              information on how a state, region or school system can develop collaborative
              and  constructive relationships with institutions of higher education or other
              partners to ensure that teachers will operate effectively in new and different
              learning environments.  The upcoming State Educational Technology Leadershipe
              Conference, as in the past, provides an excellent opportunity to promote a
              dialog between key state decision-makers and a group of researchers that are
              familiar with states and their role in setting and achieving higher standards
              for all students.  Several of participants will work directly the principal
              invest8igator for this project, and all attendees at the conference will
              receive a progress report and plans for moving forward.
