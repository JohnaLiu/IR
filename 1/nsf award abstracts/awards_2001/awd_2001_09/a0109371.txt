Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is designed to
              assess the feasibility of developing a nonintrusive diode laser sensor for
              oxygen contamination in drug product bottles. In this project, designs for
              overcoming problems associated with ambient oxygen signals and optical
              interferences due to etalons will be examined.  In addition, the sensitivity
              and accuracy of the proposed technique will be demonstrated.  Lastly, a
              preliminary examination of the possibility of performing measurements on the
              production line will be made.

If successful, this technology will be
              extendable to nonintrusive measurements in a variety of packaged and bottled
              food and drug products.
