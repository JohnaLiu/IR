Abstract    :
              The current explanations for educational disparities between minorities and
              non-minorities, as measured by grade point averages (GPA), standardized test
              scores, achievement tests, etc., range anywhere between genetic inferiority,
              genetic comparative advantages, and purely environmental factors. However, this
              entire literature, especially in economics, has for the most part, ignored a
              phenomenon entitled 'Acting White' (hereafter referred to as 'AW'). This
              postdoctoral research and training plan attempts to theoretically model and
              empirically estimate this phenomenon, in order to shed some light on the set of
              possible explanations for the observed disparities in educational attainment
              and performance between minorities and non-minorities. It is believed that in
              an environment in which 'AW' is present, one can have disparate educational
              outcomes between multiple groups even when they are all genetically identical.
              This result is due to the fact that the minority group may be required to make
              additional investments that may or may not be complementary to their likelihood
              of success in the dominant society. Furthermore, by ignoring the possibility of
              the 'AW' phenomenon, current qualitative interpretations of empirical data
              related to educational attainment may be misplaced.
