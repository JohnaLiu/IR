Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an
              optical instrument that measures velocity distribution in a flame species by
              species---and on multiple scale sizes---with an accuracy of 1%.  This novel
              velocimeter is nonintrusive and passive, relying completely on light emitted by
              the flame itself.  The instrument will be developed with experts in commercial
              combustion chemical-vapor deposition, a process that inexpensively produces
              thin-film coatings for a variety of applications, including electronics, glass,
              anti-corrosives, superconductors, catalytics, polymers, and nanopowders.  The
              velocimeter will monitor species mixing and velocity in the flame, facilitating
              "smart" deposition that can streamline real-time process control and increase
              the reliability of the coating process.   The instrument will map the velocity
              of the flame as a whole.  Phase 1 will prove the feasibility of
              species-specific, variable-scale-size velocimetry.  Phase II will perform a
              proof-of-principle demonstration with a prototype instrument. 

The principal
              commercial application is smart deposition that monitors real-time
              species-specific velocity distribution in a flame to maintain flame consistency
              and maximize deposition efficiency.  Other potential applications include
              plasma-based manufacturing and plasma thruster control.
