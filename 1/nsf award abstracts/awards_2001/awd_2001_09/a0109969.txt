Abstract    :
              Identifying areas rich in biological diversity is a critical step towards the
              conservation of biological resources.  This research will evaluate traditional,
              geographic-based biodiversity assessment methods and develop and evaluate
              improved methods that use biological collection data.  The traditional methods
              based on species range maps will be the first investigated, followed by two
              alternative methods using biological collection data for creating tend surface
              maps of occurrence.  Software tools based on all of the methods will be made
              available.  The study will have three main uses. First, it will determine
              whether traditional methods of biodiversity assessment are subject to error
              propagation from species range maps, and how and where the errors are likely to
              manifest.  Second, new techniques with trend surfaces should reduce estimation
              errors in predictions.  Third, the software will facilitate the use of
              collection databases for biodiversity assessment.
