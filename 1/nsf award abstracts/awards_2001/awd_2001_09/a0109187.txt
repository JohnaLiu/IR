Abstract    :
              
	This dissertation research by a cultural anthropology student asks how
              demographic, cultural, economic and political structures affect which community
              members participate in timber development projects in Acre, Brazil. Two
              projects involving the descendents of migrant rubber tappers will be studied. 
              The benefits and costs of various project activities will be assessed, and the
              role of individual choice in the project activities will be studied.  Multiple
              sources of data will be gathered, including informal interviews, observations,
              censuses, and formal reports.  Hypotheses will be tested relating individual
              level variables to project participation. The student and her Brazilian
              colleagues will advance our understanding of participatory development by
              revealing the structural relations which give rise to variations in community
              members' participation in projects, and will illustrate how social actors
              interpret, negotiate, resist and transform projects through their involvement. 
              By looking at the heterogeneous ways in which individuals participate and
              derive benefits and costs, the research will move beyond community -level
              measure and provide important insight to planners and local development
              organizations concerns with promoting participatory timber management.  In
              addition the project advances our knowledge of this important region of the
              world, and contributes to the training of a young social scientist.
