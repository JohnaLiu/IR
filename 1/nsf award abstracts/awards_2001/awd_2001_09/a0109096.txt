Abstract    :
              Funding will be utilized for travel of  US scientists and researchers to present
              papers at the first international workshop and conference on thermal, fluid and
              interfacial phenomena in physico-chemical, materials and bio- processes. The
              workshop will address problems on interfacial stability and transport with
              applications to materials and bio-processing such as electrodeposition, crystal
              growth, jetting, lung and corneal transport, etc.  The conference will be held
              in Giessen, Germany, between September 12 - 16, 2001, and the proceedings will
              be published.  The support is meant for graduate students and post-doctoral
              scientists as well as non-tenured faculty in the early stages of their careers.
