Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will develop a
              broadband split-beam fisheries sonar system for shallow water applications. As
              the number of fish in rivers and streams diminishes and becomes threatened,
              endangered or extinct, there is a need for better fish monitoring tools for
              such shallow water environments. Through a series of workshops, the leaders in
              the riverine sonar community have highlighted several deficiencies in the
              current monitoring systems. This Phase II Project proposes to build a fish
              tracking and counting system that addresses many of these deficiencies, and
              that has a ten-fold better range resolution and at least a 6 dB improvement in
              detection. The broadband sonar system, to be built in the course of this
              project, will include (a) a unique bizonal shaded transceiver array, (b) a full
              complement of functions for collection, storage, analysis and display of data,
              and (c) a multi-hypothesis tracker for tracking fish in low SNR and dense
              target environments. The sonar system will be validated first in a
              comprehensive set of pool tests, and then subjected to a rigorous set of
              evaluation experiments in the Kenai and Copper Rivers of Alaska and in the
              Rogue River of Oregon.

The commercial applications of this project are in a
              broad range of markets that require fish counting and tracking equipment. The
              overall market size for such equipment worldwide is estimated to be on the
              order of 1.8 billion dollars.
