Abstract    :
              This research will use ACE-Asia (Aerosol Characterizations Experiment) aerosol
              and radiometric observations to determine the radiative effects of the polluted
              aerosol coming from the Asian continent through three objectives:
1. Develop
              and validate an aerosol scattering model using the observed aerosol chemical,
              microphysical, and light scattering measurements.
2. Determine the radiative
              forcing of the aerosol, using this model and observed radiative fluxes at the
              surface and top of atmosphere.
3. Determine the context of these results by
              conducting a comparison of these forcing properties to those found for other
              regions, particularly during INDOEX (Indian Ocean Experiment).
These studies
              will concentrate on the surface radiometric and aerosol properties measured
              from the R/V R. H. Brown, and will include satellite data.

This research is
              important because of its potential to add new understanding and knowledge about
              aerosol chemistry and microphysics and the influence of aerosols on radiative
              forcing, and hence climate, over East Asia and the western Pacific.
