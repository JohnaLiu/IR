Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              the feasibility of a multiple scanned-head Critical Dimension Atomic Force
              Microscope (CD-AFM) with high throughput as a CD metrology tool.  Phase I will
              develop key design innovations for commercial in-line production quality
              control in:  (a) multiple scanned CD-AFM heads, each dedicated to scanning one
              site; and  (b) a modular, high-performance head design that enables greatly
              reduced move-acquire-measure (MAM) time.

The principal commercial
              application is to replace CD Scanning Electron Microscopes (CD-SEMs) as the
              semiconductor industry's primary CD metrology tool for in-line production
              quality control.  Other applications are seen in micromanipulators for
              microelectronics, including mask repair, and in biology.
