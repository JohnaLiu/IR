Abstract    :
              

QGene is a popular, free software package for exploration and analysis of
              quantitative genetic (QTL, or quantitative trait locus) mapping data.  It is
              unique among such packages in offering a richly graphical, interactive user
              interface and fast exploratory analysis with large datasets from a dozen mating
              designs.  It sets a standard in a genre where human-interface design is often
              neglected.  Converting the software to the C++ language while brining it to the
              state-of-the-science in statistical analysis algorithms and porting it to the
              Windows operating system will make the package more accessible.  In addition,
              using a modular architecture will give it the power to share data and
              functionality with other packages and to communicate with various genome
              databases.  Overall, the mapping community will have much more complete QTL
              software power than now available.
