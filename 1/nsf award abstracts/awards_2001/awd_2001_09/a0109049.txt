Digital Government:  Proposal to
              investigate e-business transformation at the National Science
              Foundation


This workshop will examine today's information technology
              resarch status and products, and the variety of ways research granting
              institutions currently accomplish their missions.  That examination will
              support an extrapolation of technology and organizational practices 5-7 years
              into the future, to consider how those coming technologies and practices might
              be employed in a granting institution's mission.  Of interest also will be how
              the organization of such an institution might be constructed to best take
              advantage of those technologies and to ensure the appropriate injection of new
              technologies in achieving high effectiveness in the furtherance of its mission.
