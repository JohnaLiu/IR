Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine
              the feasibility of using monolayers of bacteria to form hexagonal arrays of
              small holes in metal coated semiconductors.  Such micron-sized patterned
              materials form tuned photonic bandgap structures with narrow band emission.
              These narrow infrared line sources allow detection of liquid or vapor chemical
              species through changes in absorption. Very high- resolution, high-cost
              lithography was required to fabricate proof of principal devices. The proposed
              research would significantly lower production costs by as much as a factor of
              ten.
Phase I research would demonstrate:   (1) growth of uniform sized
              bacteria, (2) uniform dispersal on a substrate in a hexagonal array, (3) use of
              inherent electrostatic repulsion to maintain uniform separation, and (4)
              transfer of this pattern to a treated substrate.  Varying growth time and size
              of bacteria alters emission wavelength and chemical selectivity of the
              sensor.

Existing infrared vapor sensors, that are more reliable than
              electrochemical sensors, are used for high end applications that can afford an
              instrument costing hundreds of dollars.  The proposed materials development
              would reduce costs to below $10 per sensor, $50 per complete instrument,
              allowing IR chemical sensing applications to reach mass markets for automobiles
              or homes.
