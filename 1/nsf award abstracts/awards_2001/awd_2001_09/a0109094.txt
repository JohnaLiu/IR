Abstract    :
              The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this award to
              University of Massachusetts Amherst.  With the award, Professor Paul Lahti will
              study the synthesis and characterization of new stable radicals that
              incorporates hydrogen bonding groups and coordination groups such as
              carboxylates, pyridines, imidazoles and fluoroarenes.  This interdisciplinary
              research will use organic, physical and inorganic chemistry as well as physics
              for crystal engineering to induce ferromagnetic spin-spin interactions and
              alignments.  As part of this award, international collaborations will be
              carried out with University of Zaragoza in Spain and Osaka University in Japan
              to study molecular magnetism in organic polymers and materials.  Training and
              education of students in organic synthesis and characterization of novel
              materials for molecular magnetic applications will be greatly enhanced by this
              award.

Hydrogen bonding, partial fluorination, co-crystallization and
              transition metal complexation will be used in crystal engineering to induce and
              enhance ferromagnetic spin-spin interactions and alignments. This
              interdisciplinary study will have a broad impact on different field such as
              physical and organic chemistry, and solid state physics.  These studies will
              provide information about the higher critical temperatures required for
              ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic applications. In addition, this award will
              provide education and training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate
              students.
