Abstract    :

     Certain cells in the mammalian auditory brainstem
              (three
neurons from the periphery) show exceptionally small
              standard
deviations in the microsecond range of the timing of the
              first
action potential response under repeated trials of the same
sound. 
              Moreover, the latency and its standard deviation are
quite independent of
              frequency and decibel level over large
ranges.  This behavior is exceptional
              since the inputs to these
cells come from octopus and other cells in the
              contralateral
cochlear nucleus, a nucleus which is ennervated by auditory
              nerve
fibers that have much larger standard deviations and high
dependence on
              frequency and decibel level.  Thus, this system is
an example of how the brain
              can use relatively sloppy and
variable devices (neurons) to perform
              surprisingly accurate
calculations.  Professor Michael Reed, with colleague
              physiologist
Joseph Blum, investigates this system with three
              research
projects: (i) They create and investigate by machine computation
a
              large scale mathematical model of the whole system using known
physiological
              properties of auditory nerve fibers and recently
discovered properties of
              octopus cells; (ii) They use
mathematical analysis investigate of the
              improvement of the
standard deviation of latency in converging networks where
              the
target cells require coincident inputs within time windows in
order to
              fire;  (iii) They use partial differential equations to
understand the special
              properties of dendritic information
processing in octopus cells.
     Using
              mathematics and machine computation, Professor Michael
Reed continues  to
              study how groups of cells (neurons) in the
auditory brainstem perform
              calculations that individual cells can
not do by themselves.  Neurons are
              inherently sloppy and variable
devices that perform differently even under
              (apparently) the same
conditions with the same inputs.  Nevertheless, large
              groups of
these neurons are able to perform together, reliably,
              highly
accurate calculations.  This project tries to understand this
apparent
              paradox.  The project sheds light on how and why human
brains are organized
              the way they are and it suggests new
mechanisms for the development of
              man-made thinking devices.
