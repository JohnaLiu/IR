Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
              a low cost micro droplet generator for use in creating large scale micro arrays
              for biotechnology applications. Conventional methods are expensive and require
              cleaning operations and chemicals which can be eliminated with the disposable
              pump unit thereby reducing the costs for pumps, chemicals, cleaning hardware
              and  associated operations. Principal aspects of the development plan are
              insuring that drop volume and shape are of highest quality among disposable
              pump units.

The commercial application of this project will be in the
              potentially large market for production of microarrays.
