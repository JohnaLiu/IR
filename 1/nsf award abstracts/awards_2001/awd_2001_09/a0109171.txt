Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project deals with the
              need for improved angle encoders or resolvers for advanced automotive
              powertrains.  The performance of powertrains for electric vehicles (EV's) and
              hybrid electrical vehicles (HEV's) as well as for such concepts now being
              envisioned as a camless engine will require drive shaft angle encoders with
              higher resolution and faster response. This proposal addresses these needs in
              the form of an optical encoder based on an old concept, but used in an
              innovative fashion and executed with component technologies, both optical and
              electronic, that have recently become available.  The design, in addition to
              its high performance is extremely robust, in terms of temperature, alignment
              and in its tolerance to high levels of electro magnetic interference (EMI).
              Also, and essential for the automotive industry, that performance is achieved
              with the reliability and low cost demanded by that industry.

Angle encoding
              is basic to rotary drive systems. It is required for commutation and phase
              angle adjustment to affect the control of energy flow.  Angle encoders are also
              essential to optical and radar scanning mechanisms.
