Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              integrated optical amplifier/splitters through direct writing of
              sol-gel-derived, erbium-doped coatings.  Since optical signals decrease with
              transmission and manipulation, amplifiers are required.  Current designs
              involve serial arrangements of passive (splitters) and active devices
              (amplifiers).  This serial design is bulky and expensive, due to the number of
              components and interconnects.  Integrated optical devices would greatly
              simplify optical communication networks.  Phase I will incorporate
              amplification into passive devices, such as splitters, resulting in lossless
              optical devices.  To provide amplification, erbium will be incorporated into
              ceramic films via wet-chemical processing.  Subsequently, laser irradiation
              will selectively densify channels in porous coatings, thereby locally
              increasing the refractive index and providing light containment in the
              channels.  Pumping the planar device will amplify signals as they pass.

This
              technology in integrated amplifier/splitters will be key to making more complex
              integrated optical circuits in telecommunication.
