              ABSTRACT

PI: Luke E. Achenie 
Institution: University of
              Connecticut
Proposal Number: 0109928

To address the issue of solvent
              identification and/or replacement in the chemical process industries, the PI
              plans to systematize solvent design using a computer aided product design
              (CAPD) approach.  CAPD can be used either by considering the compound in
              isolation (e.g., via overall property matching) or by considering the compound
              and its interaction with a system (e.g., if it is to be used in an absorption
              process).  For the former, the designer characterizes the desirable and
              undesirable properties of a solvent that needs to be replaced for some reason
              (e.g., environmental regulations).  Other solvents are screened which match the
              desirable properties and at the same time have minimal undesirable properties. 
              For example, normal-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) is used by industry as a
              paint-stripping solvent.  Current OSHA regulations require the solvent to have
              a flash point greater than 210oF -- but the flash point of NMP is 190oF.  Hence
              another solvent needs to be used with the same physico-chemical properties of
              NMP but with a higher flash point.

The overall purpose of the project is to
              develop a unified framework combining databases, mathematical programming
              models and heuristics for reactive and nonreactive solvent design, and to do
              this and look for a proper fit for a particular solvent using computational
              chemistry.  The PI plans to incorporate uncertainty analysis as part of the
              design.
