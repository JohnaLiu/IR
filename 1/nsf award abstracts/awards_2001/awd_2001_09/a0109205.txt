Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Evolution of morphological
              diversity in iguanian lizards."  This research compares the evolution of
              morphological diversity among and within two lizard families, Agamidae and
              Iguanidae.  The goal is to identify clades that have evolved greater
              morphological disparity than other clades, test for common ecomorphological
              patterns within and between groups, and test for an association between
              increased morphological disparity and diversification rates using a
              phylogenetic context.
