Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              demonstrate photonic devices based on novel rare earth-aluminum oxide (REAl)
              glass.  These devices exploit electronic transitions in rare earth doped and
              co-doped glass that potentially enable efficient laser action at wavelengths
              from 480 to 2250 nanometers (nm) when pumped by inexpensive diode lasers. 
              Phase I will focus on the feasibility of devices having emissions at 1480 nm
              and possibly 1300 nm emission for telecommunications applications.  The
              behavior of 480-490 nm emissions will be characterized with a view toward use
              in optical data storage applications.  Phase I will also synthesize and
              characterize doped rare earth-aluminum oxide glasses, and establish protoype
              device performance.  Measurements on the rare earth doped REAl glasses will
              include the spectral absorption coefficient at the pump wavelength,
              fluorescence cross section line shape, slope efficiency, fluorescence lifetime,
              single pass gain, and IR transmission.

Potential commercial applications
              include small laser or optical amplifier devices to extend the fiber
              telecommunication bandwidth for use in high-density optical data storage
              devices.
