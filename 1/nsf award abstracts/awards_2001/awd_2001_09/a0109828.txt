Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
              beam steered electromagnetic radar using differential synchronization signal
              path switching (DSSPS) to increase the operable frequency and target
              resolution.  The research will also determine the effective imaging beam
              refraction as it exits opaque media, the feasibility of classifying human
              targets in the downrange profile, and the feasibility of implementing fractal
              geometries into bow-tie antennas to reduce ringing.  Phase I will result in a 
              compact system capable of penetrating thick opaque materials using high
              frequencies to locate targets in an arena that is otherwise reserved for low
              frequencies because of attenuation and the steering limitations of electronic
              delay methods.

Potential commercial applications are expected in
              electromagnetic application for subsurface feature detection, including voids,
              contaminants, hazardous waste containers, hydrologic-lithologic interfaces, the
              location of buried utilities, and for locating human targets through opaque
              materials such as buildings, earth, rock, and snow.  The smaller size of a high
              frequency array offers portability for the latter application.
