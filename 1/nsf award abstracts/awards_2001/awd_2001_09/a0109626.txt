Abstract    :
              Professor Michael D. Raftery is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry
              Program for his research on NMR of single crystal surfaces.  Xenon optical
              pumping and magic angle spinning solid-state NMR will be combined to produce
              unique, surface specific studies (OPMAS).  Powder semiconductor surfaces
              passivated with organic functional groups will be studied to examine bond
              coordination, surface heterogeneity and surface oxidation processes. 
              Extensions to surfaces of crystalline silicon and germanium wafers will be
              attempted.  Experiments for measuring chemical shifts as a function of depth in
              diamond and group IV materials will also be performed.  Techniques for
              improving polarization transfer from optically polarized xenon to surface
              nuclei will be developed. 

Surface phenomena have been traditionally
              difficult to study, and the addition of NMR to the battery of surface sensitive
              methods would be a large advance with possible biological and even medical
              outcomes.  This application, hydrocarbons on silicon, is important in the
              semiconductor industry.
