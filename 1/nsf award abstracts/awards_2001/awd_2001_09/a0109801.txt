Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the
              software platform, GeneRx, to incorporate pharmacogenetics and nonlinear
              adaptive algorithms toward optimizing anti-hypertension therapy on a patient
              specific basis. Preliminary studies on the psychotropic drug, olanzapine, show
              a 40% patient-by-patient error between predicted starting dose and optimal
              therapeutic dose, using a prototype trained only with patient chart
              information. This is a significant reduction from the range of starting doses
              for olanzapine currently used, which is from 1 to 80 mg/day. Anti-hypertensive
              drugs, like psychotropic drugs, have a large window of therapeutic options,
              including significant variation in dosages, medications, and combinations of
              therapies used. Using patient information and blood samples from a hypertension
              study done elsewhere, this Phase I project proposes to apply GeneRx to include
              genetic data in the modeling of hypertension treatment in combination with 
              patient chart data. Genetic data for each patient will be acquired by
              genotyping DNA from the blood samples, scored as single nucleotide
              polymorphisms (SNPs) present or absent in key hypertension-related genes.
              GeneRx will take a patient's individual genetic, demographic, and environmental
              variables and predict if initial diuretic medication or initial beta-blocker
              medication will be effective. A more efficient method to prescribe effective
              anti-hypertension therapy would expedite recovery, minimize side effects, and
              reduce medical costs.

The commercial application of this project will be in
              the field of healthcare management.
