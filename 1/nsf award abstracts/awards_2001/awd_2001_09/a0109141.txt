Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
              prototype software for designing batteries based on user requirements.  A user
              will specify an objective (such as maximize runtime) and use conditions (such
              as the electrical current), and the software determines, based on first
              principles(trade mark) models, the optimal design.  The Phase I project
              successfully yielded, based on optimization of capacity, significant
              improvements in runtime for devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs).
               The Phase II project will develop a user-friendly, prototype system that can
              handle multiple battery chemistries, simulate abuse testing, and predict
              battery life.  The software serves as an intermediary between battery
              developers and users by capturing expertise from both groups, allowing them to
              accrue benefits of simulation. Aligning development cycles of batteries to
              devices leads to better products (with concomitant market penetration, share
              growth, and lower costs).  The software protects confidential information of
              all parties, creating opportunities for broader partnerships. 

The
              commercial benefits will come from the development of the software, which
              provides a ready outlet for academic research and a rational basis for product
              specifications.  It is anticipated that if this project is successful it will
              open up the battery industry to innovation and will help to create new
              partnerships.
