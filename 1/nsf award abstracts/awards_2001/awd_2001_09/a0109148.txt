     The investigator studies differential equation models
              of
structured populations.  The structured models arise in
considering four
              applications: (1) models of tumor cords
structured by the cell cycle, (2)
              models of blood cell production
systems with proliferating and quiescent
              compartments structured
by cell maturity, (3) models of replicating prion
              populations
structured by polymer length, and (4) models
              of
vancomycin-resistant enterococci epidemics in dialysis clinics
structured
              by the time since patient admission.
     This project applies theoretical
              mathematics to biological
and medical research involving population
              interactions.  The
specific goals are to identify the behavior of
              proliferating and
quiescent cell populations in the micro-architecture
              of
vascularized tumors, to differentiate, qualitatively and
quantitatively,
              the development of normal and abnormal blood cell
population lines, to
              evaluate hypothetical mechanisms involved in
the polymerization processes of
              prion population growth in
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (mad cow
              disease), and
to predict the epidemiological effects in dialysis clinics
              of
health care worker hygiene, patient-health care worker ratios,
and
              screening of temporarily absent patients.  Benefits to
society are the
              project's contributions to the fundamental
knowledge of biological and health
              sciences.
