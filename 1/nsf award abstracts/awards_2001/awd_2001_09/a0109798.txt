Abstract    :
              This Small Business Research Phase I project will develop novel silyl protecting
              groups for RNA/DNA oligonucleotide synthesis. The synthesis of RNA is more
              difficult than DNA because a more complex protection scheme for nucleoside
              monomers is required. The 5-silyl-2-orthoester (2-ACE) strategy addresses this
              problem and provides RNA  of excellent purity and yield. This achievement is
              invaluable to RNA scientists studying molecular biology or developing
              therapeutic strategies. Such research absolutely requires synthetic
              oligonucleotides that often incorporate modifications and are made by no other
              means. The goal of this SBIR Phase I proposal is to reduce the cost and
              increase the reliability of RNA synthesis so that amidites can be provided to
              the scientific community. The new silyl groups to be developed will facilitate
              nucleoside monomer preparation by improving selectivity for 5-protection and
              will promote economical purification strategies including crystallization.
              Nucleosides 5-protected with potential silyl candidates will be examined for
              their stability, ease of deprotection during solid phase synthesis, and
              amenability to incorporation of chromophores for real-time assays of coupling
              efficiency

The commercial application of this project will be in the rapidly
              growing RNA synthesis market to support  research endeavors in molecular
              biology and drug design.
