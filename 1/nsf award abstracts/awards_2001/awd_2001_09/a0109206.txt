Abstract    :
              This postdoctoral research project will further refine and examine the
              construction and validation of three scales: 1) the African American Church
              Scale (ARCH); 2) Parental Version of the Racial Socialization Scale (PVRS); and
              3) Adolescent Version of the Racial Socialization Scale (AVRS). Each scale is a
              theory-based self-report measure. Separate focus groups consisting of parents
              and their adolescents from three predominantly African American churches will
              be conducted to assess the multidimensionality and generate items for each
              scale. A CFA will be used to investigate and refine the scale underlying
              dimensions of the ARCS, PVRS, and AVRS. Factor scales will be produced using
              data from 225 African American parent and adolescent dyads. Lastly, construct
              and discriminant validity approaches will investigate the relationship of these
              scales to existing instruments.
