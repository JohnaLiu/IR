Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I (SBIR) project will develop a
              novel antimicrobial
surface modification for polymeric biomaterials. This
              surface modification could be used to develop antimicrobial catheters, hubs,
              fabrics, and surfaces for medical instruments, as well as biofilm resistant
              dental and water lines. The need for antimicrobial catheters is great. Every
              year in the U.S., twenty million hospital patients are catheterized. Use of
              these devices places large numbers of patients at risk for a variety of
              catheter-related infectious complications. In U.S. ICUs approximately 500 to
              4000 patients die
annually of central venous catheter-related bloodstream
              infections. The annual cost of caring for patients with central line-associated
              blood stream infections is $60 to $460 million. This Phase I project proposes a
              novel antimicrobial surface modification  (1) that will covalently attach
              active groups to the surface of a variety of plastics, including polymers
              commonly used in medicine; (2) that can be formed on both the inner and outer
              surfaces of complex geometries; (3) that will inhibit bacterial adhesion by
              nonspecific oxidative destruction and by electrostatic repulsion of negatively
              charged bacteria; (4) that will be effective against bacteria, fungi, and
              spores; and (5) that will not promote increased antibiotic resistance.

The
              primary commercial application of this project will be in the medical
              instrumentation market.
