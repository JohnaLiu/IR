Abstract    :
              Impression formation theories suggest that stereotypes automatically influence
              judgments unless perceivers undergo the cognitive effort of individuating
              targets. Targets can promote this process by engaging in actions that
              disconfirm the stereotype (i.e., counterstereotypical behaviors). Ideally,
              these behaviors should promote positive impressions of targets that accurately
              reflect individual attributes rather than category-based judgments. However,
              current person perception frameworks do not acknowledge that individuation can
              have negative consequences for men and women. Because gender stereotypes are
              not only descriptive (reflecting what people "are") but also prescriptive
              (reflecting what people "should be"), disconfirming them can lead to sanctions
              for atypical behavior. For example, confident and competitive female job
              applicants are perceived as highly knowledgeable and qualified for high status
              positions, but they are also viewed as socially deficient and unlikable, which
              results in hiring discrimination. Similarly, modest and communal men are
              perceived as likable, but they are also viewed as less competent and hirable
              than are competitive men. Past research has identified numerous ways in which
              counterstereotypical men and women are sanctioned. These sanctions represent
              social barriers to gender-atypical behaviors and are, therefore, an effective
              means by which sex stereotypes are maintained. Moreover, they suggest an
              important gap in current thinking about person perception. Several experiments
              will examine the processes that underlie these barriers. The mechanisms to be
              investigated stem from expectancy-violation, system-justification, and social
              comparison theories. Because each of these frameworks relies on involuntary
              processes, implicit as well as explicit methods will be employed. In concert,
              the research should afford answers to why perceivers sanction atypical targets,
              and thereby contribute to the development of a theory of motivated implicit
              social cognition. The research will also provide insight into the social
              psychological obstacles that prevent people from successfully counteracting
              group-based expectancies.
