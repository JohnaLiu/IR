     The principal investigator and his colleagues
              develop
mathematical models and computational methods for analyzing
              the
motion of eucaryotic cilia and flagella, the growth and
development of
              the vertebrate limb bud and tumor growth.  The
objective of the cilia modeling
              is to develop three-dimensional
models for an individual cilium or flagellum
              and for
three-dimensional arrays of cilia.  These models incorporate
discrete
              representations of the axoneme's ultrastructure
including the individual
              dyneins and microtubules, as well as a
continuous description of the fluid
              mechanics using the immersed
boundary method.  Vertebrate limb development is
              a widely-used
model system for the study of development.  The investigator
              and
his collaborators have developed a 2D model for vertebrate
              limb
development that describes limb bud outgrowth and predicts
              the
spatio-temporal distribution of growth factors and morphogens.
The major
              goals of the limb development modeling are to further
validate the 2D model,
              to extend it to three dimensions in order
to determine what signals cells see
              as a function of their
position in the three-dimensional limb bud and
              developmental
history and, from this, to suggest how the signals can
              be
integrated by cells to produce the observed spatial patterning.
Limb
              development and tumor growth are moving boundary problems
that involve tissue
              growth, the transport of growth factors and
control of gene activity.  The
              investigators are developing an
immersed boundary model for tumor growth along
              with the limb
development model.
     These mathematical models focus on the
              complex biological
systems involved in cell motility, vertebrate development,
              and
tumor growth.  An important aspect is the development of
computational
              tools for the study of these processes.  Thus, the
ciliary model is used for
              the computational study of dynein
activation mechanisms in cilia and flagella
              and the multiciliary
model for the study of mucociliary interaction.  The
              vertebrate
limb development model may be used as an aid in
              interpreting
experimental results, to help identify new experiments, and
              to
test hypotheses that may be difficult to test experimentally.
Because each
              of the models described in this proposal includes a
fluid-mechanical
              representation, there is a unifying element in
their mathematical description.
               The computational methods are
based in part on the immersed boundary method,
              and the computer
codes share many of the major subroutines.  An important
              aspect of
this proposal is the development of parallel numerical methods
for
              the solution of these problems; advances in this area can be
used in a variety
              of problems in the field of computational
biofluids.
