Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to develop a novel
              potent class of biocides for use in the food and medical industries. Over the
              last decade, the emergence of pathogenic microbes that resist conventional
              treatment, such as antibiotics and chemical disinfectants, has caused great
              concern to officials in the food and medical industries. Each year nearly two
              million patients contract an infection while
hospitalized. During the last two
              decades the rate of nosocomial infections per 1,000 patient days has increased
              36 percent, while in 1995 nosocomial infections cost 4.5 billion dollars and
              contributed to more than 88,000 deaths. These "super bugs" have also reeked
              havoc in the food industry as foodborne disease causes approximately 76 million
              illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths in the United States each
              year. The novel class of biocides proposed in this project will be generated
              on-site and on-demand and will contain the beneficial characteristics of ozone
              and carboxylic acid or alcohol-based disinfectants while eliminating their
              respective weaknesses. This new armamentarium of biocides will meet the
              criteria for an ideal disinfectant  that can be recommended by public health
              officials for food and medical uses.

The primary commercial applications of
              this project will be in the food and healthcare industries.
