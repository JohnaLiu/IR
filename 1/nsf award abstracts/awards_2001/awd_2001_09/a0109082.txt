Abstract    :
              This planning proposal recognizes the constraints imposed on Alaskan schools by
              geography and small school populations while at the same time recognizing
              Alaskan opportunities for learning in context.  The Renewal component will
              consider the constraints on -- and solutions to -- problems associated with
              having a distributed cohort of experienced teachers participate in a brief but
              intense field experience using those ubiquitous Alaskan commodities, SNOW and
              ICE.  The Retention portion will consider the constraints and procedures
              necessary to involve small populations of novice teachers from Alaskan
              Districts in 137 hours of close mentoring using the snow- and ice-field work
              along with appropriate curricular materials (NSF supported GLACIER) to provide
              learning in context.  The final planning activities involve determining through
              pilot work the adequacy of follow-up work in short 1-2 day workshops during
              spring breaks, etc. as times when teachers from distributed districts can come
              together.
