Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Understanding the physiological
              and biochemical effects of increased hydrostatic pressure in seals and sea
              lions: how can they dive so deep?"  The physiological limits to diving in
              marine mammals focus on two restrictions: how long can the animal breath-hold
              and how deep can it dive? Within these limits, animals hunt by choosing a
              foraging strategy that balances the obligate costs with the potential energetic
              gains of foraging. In order to incorporate a more complete picture of the
              physiological and biochemical limitations to diving into optimal foraging
              models for diving mammals, this research is examining red blood cell membrane
              changes and non-glycolytic pathway responses to increased hydrostatic
              pressure.
