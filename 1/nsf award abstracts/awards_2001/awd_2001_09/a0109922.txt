This twelve-month award will provide support for Darrel Cowan
              of the University of Washington and seven co-principal investigators to plan a
              cooperative research project with Dr. Francesco Dramis at the University of
              Rome III on Apennine tectonics. The objective of the project is to review the
              US and Italian current and past research in the northern Apennines, formulate
              specific collaborative projects, and make a field excursion from Rome to the
              Bologna Apennines, to give all the co-PIs the opportunity to view together the
              terrain, rocks, and structures of their study area.  With the cooperation of
              the Italian researchers, the subsequent joint project, "Retreating-trench,
              extension, and accretion tectonics (RETREAT): a multidisciplinary study of the
              northern Apennines," has the potential to be a world-class study area with
              important broader implications for other tectonic systems.
