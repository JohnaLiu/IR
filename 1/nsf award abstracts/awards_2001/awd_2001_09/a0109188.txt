Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I will develop new
              implantable electrodes for use in neurological sensing and stimulation.
              Neuroprostheses have been traditionally fabricated from metals such as
              stainless steel. The effectiveness of metallic implant devices can be
              compromised by exposure to the corrosive physiologic environment. Material
              property mismatches between body tissues and metals can also reduce the
              tolerability of these devices, especially of those used around muscle tissue.
              Plastics are finding increasing application in implants due to their more
              natural stress transfer properties, corrosion resistance and biocompatibility.
              The proposed research objective is to develop a novel molecularly ordered
              silicone elastomer that offers tailorable mechanical properties, excellent
              biocompatibility, physiological stability and high electrical conductivity.
              Conducting polymers will be incorporated in a polysiloxane matrix to yield
              ordered structures for maximizing conductivity while preserving the desired
              elastomer properties. Conductive composites will be prepared and tested for
              electrical conductivity, mechanical properties, physiological durability and
              suitability for implantable devices.

The principal commercial application of
              this project is in the neuroprosthesis device market. Successful development of
              non-metallic electrodes having high electrical conductivity and improved
              biomechanical properties will have significant potential in this market. Other
              potential product areas include anticorrosion coatings and electrical shielding
              materials.
