Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the
              need for relative humidity (RH) sensors that operate at high-temperature with
              good stability.  The research objective of this project is the fabrication of
              composite RH sensors.  The morphological stability mandated by the composite
              coupled with the documented excellent humidity response of the sensing material
              should result in enhanced durability and drift stability. Owing to the thermal
              stability of the composite sensing layer, these RH sensors should function at
              temperatures up to 300 C.  If successful, the technology proposed will enable a
              new high temperature regime of RH sensing.

The composite materials science
              and engineering proposed is straightforward but innovative.  If successfully
              developed, the research project proposed is quite amenable to large-scale
              production and will make a significant contribution in this field.
