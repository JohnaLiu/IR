Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will show the
              efficacy of using small hollow glass microspheres, "Plasma-spheres", as
              cellular-size gas containers for plasma display panels.  Current plasma panel
              technology utilizes an "open" plasma system, which captures ionizable gas
              between two glass panels.  This system is difficult to fabricate.  Production
              costs are high due to time consuming gas processing techniques presently in
              use.  If successful, the new system is expected to decrease the gas processing
              time significantly, thereby lowering costs, and it will allow the production of
              flexible plasma panels.  Phase I will fabricate and gas fill the microspheres,
              construct prototype, monochrome Plasma-sphere panels, and compare their
              critical characteristics, such as efficiency, brightness, life, operating
              voltage requirements, with those achieved with a standard monochrome plasma
              panel.

Successful replacement of extant open plasma systems with
              plasma-sphere systems can reduce costs sufficiently to make high definition
              television available to the home consumer market.  Plasma-spheres may also
              extend plasma panel use to low pressure environments, e.g., high altitude and
              space applications, and to high-pressure environments, e.g., undersea
              applications.  The possibility of an open flexible plastic substrate can lead
              to various aerospace, military, and consumer applications.
