Abstract    :
              The planning project will design pilot educational exhibits for an informal
              education center, the "World Learning Center," located in the Presidio National
              Park at San Francisco.  The exhibits will be designed to engage children and
              adults in activities which will highlight the integrated nature and scientific
              basis of agriculture, the environment and human societies.

The design
              process will use site visits to observe interactive exhibitry, an iterative
              process by the team of conceptual formation to final design, and a review and
              evaluation by a national advisory group.
