Description:  This award is for support of a collaborative
              research between Dr. William Fenical, Marine Research Division, University of
              California at San Diego, San Diego, California and Dr. Diaa Youssef, Department
              of Pharamcognosy, Suez Canal University, Ismailia, Egypt
The two plan a series
              of expeditions and research seminars within Egypt and research visits of the
              Egyptian scientist to Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla,
              California.  The purpose is to expand our knowledge of the sources, types and
              reactivities of the defensive molecules produced by Red Sea invertebrates, and
              to explore the natural functions of these molecules in defensive adaptations. 
              The goal is to explore the natural products chemistry and chemical ecology of
              these marine invertebrates, principally gorgonian and alcyonacean corals,
              sponges and encrusting ascidians.  

Scope:  This award will allow a team of
              US scientists to collaborate with Egyptian scientists in a research project to
              study an area that is not well understood. The interaction should be mutually
              beneficial. The project will provide Fenical's group access to a new research
              site, and will provide them international exposure.  This exposure would be
              particularly valuable for graduate students.  It will benefit Youssef's group
              by providing them exposure to one of the leading natural products chemistry
              groups in the world, by the advanced training, and by the provided.
