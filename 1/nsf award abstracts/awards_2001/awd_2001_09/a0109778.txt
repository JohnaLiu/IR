Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to design a
              nanoparticle-monoclonal antibody conjugate that is capable of detecting select
              biological warfare agents including Brucella and Francisella. This novel
              approach to detection is effective, sensitive, selective, inexpensive and truly
              portable. The system uses an innovative detection method involving two
              wavelengths of fluorescence, which further increases selectivity and
              sensitivity. The sensor mechanism uses a thin film of conjugate that can be
              exploited in a number of ways for detection of other pathogens of relevance to
              both military and non-military sectors.

The commercial applications of the
              technology to be developed in this project will be in the area of
              counter-terrorism and in medical, food, agricultural and related fields where
              pathogen contamination must be detected.
