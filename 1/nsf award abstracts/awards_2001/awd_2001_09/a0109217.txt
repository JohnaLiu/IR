Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Genetic analysis of spinal cord
              circuit formation in the zebrafish embryo."  Large-scale genetic screens have
              revealed zebrafish motility mutants that abnormally contract muscles on the
              left and right sides simultaneously, suggesting a disruption of spinal cord
              circuits that coordinate motor output.  The goal of this research is to examine
              these mutants to elucidate the precise cellular and molecular events required
              for spinal cord circuit formation.
