Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will apply
              fluidic self-assembly (FSA) technology to the fabrication of large area
              silicon-based X-ray imaging arrays.  FSA technology offers potential for
              cost-effective production of high-speed, high-performance X-ray imaging arrays
              that are now  in demand for synchrotron protein crystallography, X-ray
              astronomy, and mammography.  Silicon X-ray diode arrays and complementary metal
              oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuit chips will be micro-machined into the
              appropriate shapes for subsequent assembly using FSA.  The FSA apparatus for
              transporting the micro-machined chips to the receptor substrate will be
              assembled and evaluated.   Phase I will evaluate these techniques in
              fabrication of an X-ray imaging array.  Phase II would include the design and
              fabrication of optimized detector structures and custom CMOS readout circuits,
              and optimization of the assembly procedures for a prototype-imaging array for
              synchrotron protein crystallography.

Potential applications are expected in
              the commercial production of X-ray imaging devices for medical, scientific, and
              other purposes.
