Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, examines the surface structure, defect structure, and surface
              chemistry of the semiconducting metal oxides TiO2, SnO2, and ZnO.  Using
              scanning probe microscopy, coupled with UHV electron spectroscopic methods, a
              detailed understanding of the effects of surface and defect structure on the
              surface chemistry of these important materials is obtained.  Professor Ulrike
              Diebold and her group in the Department of Physics at Tulane University are
              applying this information to the development of novel gas sensing devices.
              

High temperature semiconducting oxide sensors are used in a variety of gas
              sensing and monitoring applications.  The detailed understanding of the surface
              structure and surface chemistry of these oxide materials is crucial to the
              design of robust sensors in these applications.  Professor Diebold's studies of
              the surface structure and chemistry of this class of materials is providing
              this information and understanding.
