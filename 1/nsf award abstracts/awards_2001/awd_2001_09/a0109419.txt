Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              Two-Photon Resonant Holography (TPRH) imaging technique capable of recording
              time-resolved number densities of atomic or molecular species.  Resonant
              holography and the innovative application of two-photon absorption and
              photorefractive quantum well (PRQW) holographic devices will allow the
              development of high-speed systems using only low-cost, solid-state components.
              Phase I will develop the TPRH technique by constructing a prototype system and
              demonstrating its operation with a selected species.  The use of two-photon
              absorption with resonant holography allows visible or infrared (IR) lasers to
              probe species with ultraviolet (UV) absorption lines.  Costly UV lasers and
              optics can be avoided. The PRQW device enables high recording rates. These
              devices are capable of kiloHertz or megaHertz rates with energy requirements in
              the nanojoule range.

Commercial applications are expected in industrial and
              fundamental research areas: combustion, plasmas, reacting flows, in vitro
              biomedical testing, supersonic mixing and reacting flows, and basic research
              into the nonlinear behavior of atomic or molecular electronic systems. 
              Furthermore, TPRH may find applications in very low cost video rate systems;
              lightweight, low-power airborne or space-based systems; and multiple-view
              systems for tomographic measurements.
