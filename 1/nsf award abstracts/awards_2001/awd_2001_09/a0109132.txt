     There are tremendous opportunities to increase
              our
understanding of biological and biomedical research challenges
through
              mathematical and statistical methods.  But it is not easy
for researchers to
              collaborate on these topics because of a
historical gulf that separates the
              disciplines.  In order to
overcome that gulf, the Board on Mathematical
              Sciences of the
National Research Council, in collaboration with the NRC's
              Board
on Life Sciences, holds a workshop, involving some 70 people
across the
              disciplines, to (1) stimulate some new collaborations
and insights on the spot
              and (2) provide an introduction for
mathematical scientists (disseminated via
              print and the Internet)
of some mathematical research directions that
              contribute to
important ongoing research in the biological and
              biomedical
sciences.
     At the workshop, leading researchers in dynamical
              modeling
of cellular functions, in modeling of disease states, and
              in
neuroscience describe some of the major research challenges in
their
              fields.  They do not limit themselves to "mathematical"
challenges; workshop
              discussions are focused on identifying the
mathematical and statistical
              research that should be undertaken
in order to advance the biological and
              biomedical research
agendas.  By involving a broad range of mathematical
              scientists,
the workshop brings a number of different perspectives and
              ideas
to bear on the open questions raised by the presentations.  The
aim is
              to stimulate a wide-ranging discussion and distill out the
best ideas.  The
              workshop's summary will be widely disseminated
in order to give many more
              mathematical scientists the basic
understanding needed to become engaged in
              biological and
biomedical research.
