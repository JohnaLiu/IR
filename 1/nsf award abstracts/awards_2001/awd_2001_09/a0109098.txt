Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will integrate
               random, reactive ion etching (RIE) texturing techniques into low-cost,
              multi-crystalline (mc) silicon (Si) solar cells.  RIE texturing techniques,
              developed in Phase I, are distinguished by their low-reflection (1 percent),
              large area (200 square centimeters) application, and the ability to control
              etched profiles.  This texture control has been employed to increase near
              infrared absorption in Si by enhanced oblique optical coupling into the
              substrate.   RIE-texturing techniques have potential application in several
              fields including low-cost substrates for surface enhanced Raman scattering and
              field emission devices.  Phase II will be concerned with conformal emitter
              formation techniques uniquely suited to RIE-textured surfaces.  These methods
              will lead to solar cell manufacturing in a cluster environment with similar
              chambers for texturing, emitter formation, and nitride films for surface
              passivation.

Potential industrial applications are expected in
              high-efficiency, RIE-textured, mc-Si solar cells using processes suitable for
              their respective manufacturing environments.
