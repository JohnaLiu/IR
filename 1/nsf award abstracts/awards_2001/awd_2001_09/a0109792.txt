Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will test new
              methods to detect and distinguish similar strains of the bacteria Haemophilus
              influenzae. Ninety-five percent of systemic infections in childhood are caused
              by H. influenzae strains of the serotype b. They include meningitis, sepsis,
              epiglottitis, pneumonia and otitis media. Bacterial meningitis and epiglottitis
              are life-threatening diseases with a lethality of five percent to twenty-five
              percent. Thus, a real-time sensor capable of detecting specific strains of H.
              influenzae in the parts-per-trillion range is needed. Any new detection device
              must be highly sensitive and selective, miniature, self-diagnostic, low cost,
              have rapid response time, and require no sample preparation. This Phase I
              project proposes such a novel point-of-care detection device for highly
              sensitive determination of H. influenzae and other bacteria strains. This
              approach builds on recent research conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
              using microcantilevers as sensor platforms. The BioTELL sensor will consist of
              an array of microcantilevers with one surface derivatized by an antibody
              coating receptive to H. influenzae antigens.

The commercial applications of
              this project will be in the biosensor market for detection of H. influenzae and
              other disease causing microorganisms. The primary customers for products
              developed through this project are expected to include pediatricians, general
              practitioners and consumer households.
