	Men in traditional communities are often thought
              to be less concerned about maternal health and mortality than women, the
              difference stemming from the traditional division of labor of men focusing
              outside the household, and women relating more towards inside the household
              events. This dissertation research project by an anthropology student from
              Emory University will study the role of men in maternal health and mortality in
              the Mayan community of Cantel, Guatemala.  The study will examine patterns of
              men's influences on health in the context of Guatemala's recent civil violence
              and subsequent Mayan ethnic activism.  The student will investigate men's
              beliefs, attitudes, and contributions to household health status through a
              combination of health surveys, anthropometric health indicators, and
              qualitative interviews and observations. Hypotheses will be tested relating
              maternal morbidity and mortality with household access to health care, maternal
              health, socioeconomic indicators, ethnic identity, and an array of men's
              activities. The results from this study will be valuable correctives to the
              relative paucity of information on men's' household health contributions; will
              inform health interventions directed towards improving maternal and infant
              health; will contribute to the training of a young social scientists, and will
              advance our knowledge of this important region of the world.
