Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Statistical tools for analyzing
              gene expression data."  The goal of this research is to develop statistical
              tools for analyzing gene expression data derived from DNA microarray
              experiments and to generate an analytical framework for relating distributions
              of gene expression profiles to variation in phenotypic traits.  Particular
              emphasis is being paid to developing methodologies that incorporate a priori
              biological knowledge and that facilitate the development and testing of
              biological hypotheses.
