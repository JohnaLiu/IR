Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              novel high-speed broadband optical switches, where the optical data do not
              leave a fiber waveguide.  Unlike integrated optics and planar waveguides, this
              approach has strong advantages in lower insertion loss, higher speeds, lower
              drive voltages, and reduced fabrication costs.  Since these devices are
              inherently narrow-band, they can support dramatic reduction in channel width
              (higher channel count) in dense wavelength division multiplexed systems. At the
              same time, the lower voltage and faster electro-optic switching allow greater
              speeds, already demonstrated in excess of 110 GigaHertz in planar devices using
              this technology.

The commercial market for high-speed, power-efficient
              optical switches is among the largest in the modern economy.  The potential for
              cost savings via improved efficiency is expected to justify the retrofit of
              existing infrastructure.  Considering revenue increases due to capacity
              expansion, this technology could figure prominently in the next expansion of
              transcontinental, intercontinental, and metropolitan high-speed data transfer
              service devices, sensors, and other devices.
