Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will initiate the
              development of an entirely new class of biochips, with a particular focus on
              biochips designed to track the expression, activation and post-translational
              modification of proteins involved in cell signaling processes. These biochips
              will be widely applicable to the field of proteomics. The technology is based
              on the use of liquid crystals to image biomolecular interactions at structured
              surfaces.  The goal of this project is to demonstrate that substrates for
              liquid crystal-based biochips can be prepared from mechanically rubbed films of
              protein that are covalently attached to glass substrates. The important issues
              of non-specific adsorption, binding of specific target proteins and stability
              of rubbed protein films will be addressed. This approach to fabrication of
              biochips aims to leverage the manufacturing knowledge generated over past
              decades for liquid crystal display technology and thereby provide low cost
              biochips with potential for broad impact.This class of biochip has the
              potential to be extremely rapid (minutes), to be highly sensitive (magnitudes
              more sensitive than gels and ELISA), to be inexpensive (less than
              $0.20/determination) and when combined with microfluidics, to make possible the
              imaging of large numbers of proteins simultaneously .

The commercial
              applications of the technology and the products to be developed in this project
              will be in well defined markets, ranging from biotechnology and pharmaceutical
              companies to general scientific research laboratories that are conducting
              research in cellular signalling pathways.
