Abstract    :
              In this proposal funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Laurie Butler of the University of Chicago will pursue a
              program of research to continue studies of electronic effects on photochemical
              reaction-product channels.  Two sets of experiments are described.  The first
              will probe the competing unimolecular dissociation channels of isomerically
              selected hydrocarbon radicals as a function of internal energy in the radical. 
              The second set continues prior work to understand the product branching in
              chemical reactions in which there is a large required change in electronic
              wavefunction in evolving from reactant to one or more of the product channels. 
              The Chemical Dynamics Beam Line at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) in Berkeley,
              California will be used for many of these experiments.

Radical intermediates
              play a key role in a wide range of chemical processes, yet even after decades
              of research the reactions of many key radical intermediates elude direct
              experimental study.  The current state of knowledge can be described as crude. 
              This project addresses the basic principles of chemical reactivity, identifying
              the conditions under which different products are produced from a given
              reaction.  The results of this work will ultimately contribute to understanding
              of processes as diverse as combustion, photochemical smog production, and
              chemical vapor deposition.
