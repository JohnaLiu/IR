Abstract    :
              This project includes a comprehensive field and laboratory measurement program
              to study nitrous acid (HONO) in the boundary layer of non-urban environments. 
              Two hypotheses will be tested.  The first will examine the possibility that
              nitric acid photolysis on surfaces constitutes a major daytime source of HONO
              and serves as a remobilization pathway for nitrogen oxides in the non-urban
              environment.  The second will evaluate the potential for the ground/vegetation
              surfaces to influence both temporal and spatial HONO distributions in the
              atmosphere.  The field measurements will be conducted at the University of
              Michigan Biological Station, the location of the Program for Research on
              Oxidants: PHotochemistry, Emissions, and Transport (PROPHET).
