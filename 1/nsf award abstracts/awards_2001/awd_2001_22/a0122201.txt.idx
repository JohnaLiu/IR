Abstract    :
              This proposal is to cover expenses associated with hosting the Digital Libraries
              Initiative All Projects Meeting in June 2001.  The All Projects Meetings have
              been held semi-annually since the program's inception in 1994 and have been
              essential to building collaborations between funded projects, establishing and
              maintaining program identity and direction, and stimulating valuable personal
              interactions between researchers, graduate students, and information
              professionals from all sectors.  The meeting agenda is structured to allow
              projects to report and demonstrate research products, and discuss and assess
              the relative merits and promise of new capabilities.
