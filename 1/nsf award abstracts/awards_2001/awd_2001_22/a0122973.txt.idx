Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT ( 01-22973) ROSENBERG   KNEXUS and its Symposium series reflect a
              highly innovative, multidisciplinary approach that addresses change at the
              level of the economy or society. It blends new understandings in human
              cognition; economics, economic history and institutions; new methods of data
              analysis; and evolutionary theories of economics and society to focus on
              change. Any serious study of change in economies, polities and societies must
              acknowledge uncertainty. To do so effectively, however, the starting point must
              be an account of human cognition, through which human beings individually and
              in larger groupings understand and by means of which they generate change. This
              Symposium will address the cognitive foundationos of change, and the consequent
              processes of change at social, political and economic levels. Recent
              advancements in network analysis offer promise of a theoretical approach that
              can yield empirically testable models, and thus the Symposium will address the
              role of networks in a theory of social and economic change.   The proposed
              Symposium will bring together scholars from diverse relevant disciplines
              (including, but not limited to, economics, economic history, technology
              studies, intellectual history, human cognition and sociology, organization and
              management studies).
