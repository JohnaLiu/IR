Abstract    :
              The American Chemical Society (ACS) has supported the increased participation of
              minorities in the chemical sciences through programs for minorities and
              economically disadvantaged students since 1968.

Through Project SEED (Summer
              Educational Experiences for the Disadvantaged), the Society encourages about
              200 to 300 economically disadvantaged minority high-school students each year
              to enter careers in science through summer experiences in research. Over the
              past thirty-three years, more than 6,000 students nation-wide - 86%
              underrepresented ethnic minorities - had opportunities to establish mentoring
              relationships with chemists at colleges, in industry and in government through
              summer research experiences, with 55% subsequently selecting college majors in
              the sciences. ACS's local sections work to recruit both students and mentors
              for SEED, where the mentoring activity includes guidance on a research project
              for 8-10 weeks, reporting on project findings, and professional development
              including attending scientific lectures, visiting local industries and
              universities, and providing assistance with college applications. A 1996 survey
              showed that 70% of the program participants majored in a science in college
              following their SEED experience, with 63% earning BS degrees, 13% earning MS
              degrees,7% earning doctoral degrees, and 9% earning other degrees. 

ACS also
              provides financial support for economically disadvantaged minority students
              (and has done so since 1995) through a multi-million dollar scholarship program
              to assist students in achieving degrees in the chemical sciences. More than 900
              students have received support, of whom 56% are female, 44% are male; their
              ethnic groups include African-American (56%,), Hispanic/Latino (38.5%), and
              American Indian (5.5%). Those graduated thus far total 276, of whom 56% are
              female, 44% are male; their ethnicity are African-American (52%,),
              Hispanic/Latino (43%), and American Indian (5%); with 43% enrolled in graduate
              programs and 34% employed in the chemical science workforce. Program graduates
              become part of the Scholars Program Alumni Network, which provides ongoing
              information about ACS and the scholars program, and provides alumni with
              opportunities to serve as mentors to current scholars.
