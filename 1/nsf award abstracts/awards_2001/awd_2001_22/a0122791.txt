Abstract    :
              The Office of Outreach of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at the
              University of North Texas Health Science Center was established in 1994 to help
              to recruit underrepresented minority student into the biomedical sciences. The
              implemenatation includes activities from students from elementary and secondary
              schools (K-12) through undergraduate and graduate university. The outreach
              program works to encourage students to enter science fields. That activity is
              supported by an annual mentoring workshop for faculty. Other program elements
              include the Adopt-A-School program for support of K-12 students, the Summer
              Multicultural Advanced Research Training (SMART) and McNair programs to build
              student relationships with faculty mentors. Bridge partner programs connect
              institutions to support students in transferring smoothly into doctoral
              programs. The program has become the state's leader in the enrollment
              percentage of Hispanic and African-American students, with the enrolling
              undergraduate class for Fall 2000 at 35 percent Hispanic and African-American
              students (35 percent white, 24 percent foreign, 6 percent Asian-American).
              Similarly, the graduate population of the biomedical program is 1 percent
              Hispanic and 10 percent African American, compared to national figures for
              science enrollment at less than 4 percent of Hispanic and African-American
              students. The Center anticipates graduating ten students with Ph.D. degrees in
              May 2001, of whom half are African-American or Hispanic.
