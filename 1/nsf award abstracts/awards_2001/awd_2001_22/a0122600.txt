Educational
              Innovation:  A Concentration Track in Embedded Systems

This project presents
              a novel structure for a concentration track in embedded systems. The new
              curriculum combines important aspects of content, synthesized from the latest
              research in academia, with industry research aspects channeled through a
              capstone project (implemented as internships in industry). The curriculum spans
              a spectrum of activities related to the design and delivery of educational and
              research efforts and is characterized by three main innovative components
              namely; a new industry-university collaborative model for integrating basic and
              applied research, creation and delivery of state-of-the-art course content and
              appropriate laboratories, delivery of a capstone project through internships.
              The embedded systems curriculum emphasizes fundamental issues such as the
              balance between hardware and software and the respective trade-offs in building
              embedded systems. Practical design experience is fostered through the courses,
              laboratory experiments, and capstone projects that expose the students to the
              state-of-the-art design methodologies. In addition, internships, funded by
              industry, expose the students to work on applied projects mentored by the
              industrial supervisors and faculty fellows.
