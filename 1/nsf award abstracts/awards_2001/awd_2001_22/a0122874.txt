Abstract    :
              Over the last three years, a 3D nonlinear fluid code has been developed by the
              PIs to investigate the generation of small-scale size (1-100 km) irregularities
              in the high latitude plasma patches.  This intermediate scale size regime,
              which is attributed to naturally occurring instabilities on the larger patch
              size scales, is of interest to the High Latitude Plasma Structure (HLPS) group
              of the NSF-sponsored CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of the
              Atmospheric Regions) initiative.  The successful completion of the development
              of the 3D code, which has the potential for explaining many of the observed
              features now leads to a stage where detailed comparison with observations and
              realistic event modeling can be readily undertaken.  Thus a three-year program
              is proposed to investigate the observed variability in the structuring.  An
              important output from the 3D code is the characteristics of the fluctuations
              along the field line.  Though unlikely that two satellites at different heights
              will be located along the same field line, a sampling of the relative
              amplitudes of the irregularities could provide a useful comparison with
              simulations.
