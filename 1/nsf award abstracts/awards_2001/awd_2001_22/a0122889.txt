Abstract    :
              Project Summary
This project provides 29 scholarships per year to talented
              low-income students in computer science and mathematics. The project encourages
              community college (CC) graduates with AS degrees to continue their education
              through the BS degree. The scholarships are used as a recruiting tool to
              attract students to computer science and mathematics. Four categories of
              scholarships are offered for CS and Mathematics students: (1) four-year
              scholarships for incoming first-year students (offered during year one of the
              project), (2) two-year scholarships for CC transfer students (offered during
              the first three years of the project), 
(3) two-year scholarships for CS
              graduate students (offered during the first three years of the project), and
              (4) one-year scholarships (offered in the first and last years of the
              project).

Scholarship recipients are selected on the basis of financial
              need, according to established guidelines, and according to ability, based upon
              GPA, standard test scores, demonstrated professional ability, and overall class
              ranking. For retention, existing student support programs are used and
              expanded, including supplemental instruction, tutoring, internship placement,
              and career placement. Students also have access to clubs and organizations that
              offer mutual support, including: chapters of ACM, IEEE, and MAA; Upsilon Pi
              Epsilon (CS) and Pi Mu Epsilon (mathematics) honor societies; an active
              mathematics club; and a local student-led Unix users group.
