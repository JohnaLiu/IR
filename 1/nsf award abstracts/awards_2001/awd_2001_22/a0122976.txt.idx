Abstract    :
              The Scholarships in Mathematics and Computer Science (SIMACS) program is
              awarding scholarships to qualified students majoring in the relevant
              disciplines. The scholarships are increasing the number of women enrolled in
              computing science and mathematics degree programs. Selection of the scholars is
              based  leadership and school and/or community involvement in addition to
              academic ability. Bi-weekly group meetings of scholars and faculty mentors, as
              well as individual meetings scheduled in the alternate weeks serve to ease the
              transition from high school to college and from junior college to the four year
              institution.
