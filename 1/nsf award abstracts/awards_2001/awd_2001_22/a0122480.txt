Abstract    :
              The Hilltopper Mathematics and Computer Science Scholarship (HMCSS) project
              provides support to 20 students for a period of three years. The target
              audience will be current freshmen enrolled at St.
Edward's University and
              transfer students articulating from Community Colleges.
The HMCSS projectl
              builds on the existing College Assistance
Migrant Program (CAMP) which is
              designed to offer an educational opportunity to the sons
and daughters of
              migrant and seasonal farm workers.
