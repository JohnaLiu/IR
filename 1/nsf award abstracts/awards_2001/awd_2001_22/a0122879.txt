Abstract    :
              This Award is to provide for support of an Annual Grantees Conference of
              Metabolic Engineering Projects funded by Agencies participating in the
              Interagency Metabolic Engineering Working Group (MEWG).   The Conference is
              scheduled to be held at the National Science Foundation (NSF) on June 28, 2001.
                The objective of this Conference is to provide the funding Agencies with an
              opportunity to review progress on their Metabolic Engineering Awards. This
              Conference will also provide an important service to the research community in
              the area of Metabolic Engineering and may identify opportunities for future
              research directions.  Information generated at this Conference may be useful
              for planning purposes for the MEWG and the Biotechnology and Biochemical
              Engineering Programs in the Bioengineering and Environmental Systems Division
              of the NSF Engineering Directorate.  Information presented at the Conference
              will be distilled into a report for NSF and the MEWG.
