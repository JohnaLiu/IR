This is a planning grant for a Trial of Time exhibit at
              the Grand Canyon, which will be the centerpiece of an effort to provide a
              unique and dynamic interaction of scientists, educators, the National Park
              Service and geoscience students of every level and age.  The Trail may be
              integrated with the "Heritage Education Center", a concept that is evolving at
              the Park.  Once the scientific and information technologies infrastructure
              exists, the PIs will develop geoscience education components at three separate
              educational levels:  a college-level curriculum component, a K-12 component,
              and an informal education component.  The spectacular and varied geology of the
              Grand Canyon and the Trail of Time present an unparalleled educational
              opportunity at all these levels.
