Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative research project between the Engineering Research Center
              for Reconfigurable Machining Systems (RmS) at the University of Michigan and
              the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) at the University of
              Wisconsin at Milwaukee.  The objective of this research is to develop a
              methodology of web-based informatics platform toenable an implementation of
              remote monitoring and assessment of production machinery in internet-augmented
              reconfigurable manufacturing environment.  The methodology will address the
              underlying issues in correlating machine condition and manufacturing process
              data into predictable and usable machine health and performance over time.
