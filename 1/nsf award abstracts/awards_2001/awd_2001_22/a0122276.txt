Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the purchase of a 28 foot pontoon boat equipped
              with 90 hp. motor and davit for the Fred Telonicher Marine Laboratory.  The
              boat, which will be capable of carrying 15 persons, will be used for courses
              and research, largely in shallow areas near the Laboratory .  The Laboratory
              provides a diverse set of marine-oriented research and education programs,
              including graduate, undergraduate and K-12 programs, but with emphasis on
              college level classes.  The boat will facilitate access to estuarine habitats
              at or near the mouths of several nearby rivers,  and will allow use of
              bottom-sampling devices for research into the physical composition of the ocean
              floor and the physiology and population biology  of various plants, animals and
              microbes that inhabit the areas.
