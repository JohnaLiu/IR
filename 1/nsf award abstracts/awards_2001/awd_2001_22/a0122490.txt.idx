Abstract    :
              This award supports the Gordon Research Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry in
              Newport, RI on June 17-21, 2001. This Gordon Research Conference is one of the
              major meetings in this field. This year, the conference will cover a broad
              range of areas in atmospheric chemistry, including measurements of the
              troposphere from space, tropospheric aerosols, urban and regional chemistry,
              global tropospheric chemistry, snowpack and high-latitude boundary layer
              phenomena, Sun/Earth coupling in atmospheric chemistry, interactions between
              laboratory and theoretical studies of atmospheric reactions, and stratospheric
              chemistry and dynamics. The meeting will be attended by both established
              researchers and young scientists, among them the participants of the preceding
              Atmospheric Chemistry Colloquium for Emerging Senior Scientists (ACCESS).
