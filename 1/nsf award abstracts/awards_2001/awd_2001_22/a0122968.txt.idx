Abstract    :
              Planning Grant for Restructuring Math Delivery Systems at Fort Belknap College
               The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive plan for increasing
              student success in  mathematics at Fort Belknap College (FBC). The college
              will achieve this goal through the  successful completion of three specific
              project objectives. During the one-year planning  period, project personnel
              will: (1)perform a thorough self-assessment of the current math curriculum in
              place at FBC; (2)conduct an in-depth review of alternative instructional
              methods, curricula and delivery systems that have proven successful with
              minority students (and, specifically, American Indians) across the country; and
              (3)develop a comprehensive planning document for designing and implementing a
              math program that addresses specific local and institutional needs, while
              incorporating best practices from model programs. The results of these planning
              efforts will provide the basis for developing an implementation/design proposal
              to be submitted under NSF's 2003 TCUP solicitation. Ms. Mary John Taylor, Dean
              of Academic Affairs, and Ms. Billie Jo Foote, Math/Science Instructor, will
              serve as co-principal investigators for the project. Fort Belknap College is
              requesting $50,000 to carry out this project over a 12-month period.  PROPOSAL
