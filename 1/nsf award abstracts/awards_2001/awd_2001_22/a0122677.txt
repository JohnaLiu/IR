Abstract    :
              This program provides scholarships for students who are majoring in computer
              science or mathematics or who are completing a double major combining
              engineering with biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, or physics.
              The program includes a special orientation, scholar-based and peer-based
              mentoring (emphasizing both academic and socialization skills), formal
              collaborations with the office of career development, a dedicated web site, the
              establishment of a CSEMS Club, in addition to peer tutoring and internships
              with high-technology partner firms.
