              ABSTRACT  Visualization Learning Environments for Teaching Inquiry and Earth
              Science Concepts: A Model for Improving Earth Science Teaching  This project
              develops a pilot model for improving elementary teacher preparation in earth
              sciences, scalable for broader systematic change. The model consists of a
              framework for implementing visualization learning environments (simulations,
              modeling, and imagery of real data sets) in undergraduate science courses for
              the purpose of constructing inquiry-based learning. The pilot model is based on
              an eighteen-month longitudinal study on the use of visualization learning
              environments in an elementary teacher preparation science course taught at the
              University of Northern Colorado, Principles of Scientific Inquiry.. The
              longitudinal study is crucial in assessing the long-term impact of
              visualization learning environments on content literacy and inquiry skill
              development. The project contributes significantly to the evaluation section of
              the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE) as a beta test site for
              DLESE's Evaluator Tool-kit, an instrument for methods and protocols for
              assessing activities and courses that utilize inquiry-based activities. 
              Faculty teaching general education science courses could adapt the model
              created by this project for use in their classes.
