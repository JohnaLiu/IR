Abstract    :
              This project will test a new idea related to the prediction of seasonal to
              interannual climate using coupled atmosphere-ocean General Circulation Models
              (AGCM and OGCM, respectively).  The methodology builds on the notion that
              ensembles of AGCM realizations (probabilistic predictions) can be used to
              reduce the model "noise" or non-meaningful signal in the predicted fields, and
              isolate and improve the climate signal at the air-sea interface.  The multiple
              realizations, or solutions, of a particular AGCM, or multiple realizations from
              different AGCMs, will be coupled to a single OGCM and the ensemble mean
              atmospheric fluxes will be used to drive the ocean model and make the coupled
              climate probabilistic predictions.  If successful, this project could
              significantly improve climate predictions at extended range to interannual time
              scales.
