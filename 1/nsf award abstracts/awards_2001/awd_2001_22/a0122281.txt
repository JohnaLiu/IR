Abstract    :
              Competition among closely related species is thought to be an important factor
              driving species distributions.  Though competition among salamanders in the
              genus Plethodon appears to be common, the consequences of competition on
              morphology are less well understood.  In this project, hypotheses about
              morphological change will be tested in two well-characterized species pairs. 
              Several methods will be used to quantify morphology, including linear distance
              measurements and landmark-based geometric morphometric methods.  For P. jordani
              and P. teyahalee, it is hypothesized that morphological differences are more
              extreme in the Smoky Mountains than in the Balsam Mountains.   This hypothesis
              is based on knowledge of ecological and behavioral interactions of these
              species in the two mountain ranges.  For P. cinereus and P. shenandoah, it is
              hypothesized that an extinct population of P. shenandoah and a nearby
              population of P. cinereus are more morphologically similar than populations in
              other regions where both species coexist.  This hypothesis is based on
              knowledge of behavioral and aggressive interactions.  
       
Results from
              this project will help us understand how interspecific competition affects
              morphological variability in Plethodon, which has important consequences for
              how organisms interact with their environment.  On a larger scale, results from
              this project will provide a better understanding of the relative importance of
              competition as a driving force behind community assemblages, and help us
              understand the influence of competition on the geographic distribution of
              organisms.
