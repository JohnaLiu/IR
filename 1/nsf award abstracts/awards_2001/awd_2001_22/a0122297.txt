Abstract    :
              The project would conduct Development phase activities necessary to implement a
              systemic reform effort in schools on the Cheyenne River Reservation, in South
              Dakota. The proposed activities of the project include conducting a series of
              community/school meetings to help the personnel, parents, and communities to
              understand systemic reform.  The recommendations that arise from the meetings
              will serve as the foundation for a five-year Implementation strategy.
