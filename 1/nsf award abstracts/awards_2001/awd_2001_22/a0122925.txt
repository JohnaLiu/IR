This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research
              (SGER) to enable the principal investigator (PI) to explore the feasibility of
              reactive extrusion based on the fast anionic ring-opening polymerization of
              cyclic amides in a matrix of a commercial polymer such as polypropylene (PP),
              to yield a nanostructured PP/polyamide 6 blend with unique properties. 
              "Nanostructured" is used because the dispersion of one polymer phase in the
              other is below 100 nanometers.  The research is to demonstrate proof of concept
              of generating these structures in reactive extrusion using ring-opening
              polymerization of cyclic amides.  The potential versatility of the
              nanostructures polymer blends will make them useful in applications such as
              optics, drug delivery, tissue engineering and permeable membranes for
              separation phenomena.

Blending of polymers is one method used to obtain new
              polymeric materials.  Over 30% of commercial polymers used worldwide are
              polymer bends or alloys.  An example is acrylonitrile copolymer and
              polybudatiene grafted styrene-acrylontitrile copolymer.  The evolution of
              morphology during melt blending of a polymer blend is poorly understood and the
              ability to predict this morphological evolution is a goal of this project.
