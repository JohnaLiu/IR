A collaborative effort to study
              nucleation and growth during the early stages of thin film growth by
              electrodeposition will be carried out.  This work will build on a recently
              developed mathematical model of electrochemical nucleation that allows
              inclusion of phenomena not previously considered.  The model will be used in
              the simulation of difficult cases, such as copper deposition from pyrophosphate
              bath, where conventional models fail.  Simulated results will be compared with
              both measured current transients and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging of
              deposited nuclei.  Instantaneous nucleation will involve rotating disk
              experiments to characterize growth processes as a function of overpotential,
              cupric ion concentration, pyrophosphate concentration, pH and convective
              conditions.  These results are expected to provide mechanistic information and
              growth rate constants.  Progressive nucleation will be pursued with
              chronoamperometry and AFM measurements on gold cyanide baths.  This work could
              have significant impact outside of electrodeposition, and areas such as
              emulsions, aerosols, micelles, and crystallization could also benefit from this
              project.  This work may find more immediate application in microfabrication
              processes.
