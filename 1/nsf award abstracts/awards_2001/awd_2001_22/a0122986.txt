Abstract    :
              The St. Ambrose University CSEMS Program provides 30 low-income
              or
disadvantaged computer and information science majors the financial,
              academic, social, and peer
support they need to persist to graduation. We
              offer four eligible majors: bachelor's degrees in
computer science (CS),
              computer and information science (CIS), and computer network
administration
              (CNA) and a new master's degree in information technology management
              (ITM).
Students are selected based on financial need and academic promise.
              Students selected for the CSEMS program will receive the following support:
              enrollment in learning communities (for first year students); assignment to
              peer, professional and faculty mentors; monthly professional seminars (e.g.,
              college transition for entering students, career planning and placement for
              upper level students); and academic support (tutoring). Upper-level students
              will participate in job shadowing and either an internship or practicum to get
              on-the-job experience and for career preparation.
