Abstract    :
              Dr. Melvin Webb began developing mentoring activities in 1979 with the Saturday
              Science Academy program in Atlanta, which provided educational enhancement in
              science, mathematics, computer application and communication skills for
              elementary-school students, and a Summer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics
              Institute for high-school students. His efforts to increase the participation
              of women and minorities span more than twenty-two years. The Saturday Science
              Academy enrolled more than 5,000 local students between 1979 and 1996, and
              posed as a national model for similar programs.

Dr. Webb's activities have
              progressed based on solid planning developing funds and implementation
              strategies that have had profound effects on minority success in SMET. From his
              faculty post in the Biology Department at Clark Atlanta University, Dr. Webb
              subsequently began to develop programs supporting undergraduate students. He
              led the effort to develop a multi-departmental honors program through which
              students could earn both a BS and an MS in five years; this became the Program
              for Research Integration and Support for Matriculation to the Doctorate
              (PRISM-D). The first cohort of students was in 1990-91. Thus far six cohorts
              have graduated and 131of the 145 participants have earned BS degrees (90.3
              percent), and 80 of the 131 BS degree recipients have earned MS degrees in the
              sciences (61 percent). Several students have earned doctorate degrees or are in
              graduate or professional schools. Dr. Webb has published and presented numerous
              papers detailing his success at local, regional and national levels, providing
              dissemination of the mentoring models that pose as successful practices in SMET
              education. Also noteworthy is the network of K-12 schools, government and
              industry participants partnering in the programs that Dr. Webb has built.
