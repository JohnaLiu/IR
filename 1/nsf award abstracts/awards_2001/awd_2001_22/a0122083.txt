              ABSTRACT

Arctic Alive

Arctic Alive is an e-learning project that brings
              cutting-edge geosciences research to the K-12 classroom, integrates geosciences
              curriculum, provides opportunities for K-12 teachers to work with scientists,
              and promotes global understanding about the value and worldwide significance of
              the Arctic region.  Arctic Alive focuses on arctic research, the importance of
              the arctic region including its role in global climate change, and its
              extraordinary environments and diverse cultures. Science is the central
              curriculum theme, while technology is the catalyst. Arctic Alive is an
              interactive, real-time, and unique web-based education program. It uses a
              variety of delivery methods and e-learning strategies to deliver arctic
              research to the classroom. Two key program components are a teacher in the
              field with the geoscientists to facilitate activities in the classroom, and
              student interactions with the researchers. Educators and students integrate the
              Arctic Alive program not only into their sciences curriculum but also social
              studies and technology curricula. The Arctic Alive program aligns with National
              Education Standards in technology, science, and math, as well as Alaska Content
              Standards for Students.
