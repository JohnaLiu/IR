              ABSTRACT

Looking Forward --Scaling Up the Digital Image Archive of Landscape
              Change

This is phase two of work begun under an earlier award.  Geologic
              archives of landscape response to climate change and human impact (pond and
              alluvial fan sediments) are the subjects of this project.  The first phase
              demonstrated the feasibility of the project, the high level of interest in the
              high school community, and the value of the resulting image bank to a variety
              of constituencies.  Phase two of the pilot project continues to bridge gaps
              both between university research and high-school education and between history
              and science. The program connects high-school students and teachers, University
              of Vermont faculty, staff, and students, museum curators, town officials and
              librarians, and the Education Specialist for the Perkins Geology Museum at the
              University of Vermont. Townspeople work with each student to find at least two
              historic photographs clearly showing human/landscape interaction and assist the
              students as they attempt to relocate the place from which each photo was taken.
              Students and townspeople submit their work over the web using templates
              developed under this funding project.
