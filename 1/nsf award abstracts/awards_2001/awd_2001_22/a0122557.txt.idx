Abstract    :
              The computational GRID vision is that everyone at a desktop machine could
              eventually have the power of a supercomputer at his or her fingertips. The GRID
              takes its name from the electrical utility analogy.   GRID computing holds
              the promise of transforming the Internet, now used for communication, mainly e-
              mail and instant messaging, while the Web is an information retrieval system,
              enabling computer users to have access to text, images and music. Grid
              computing builds on the result of previous and ongoing research in networking,
              distributed computing, seamless computing, meta computing, web technologies,
              and other related topics.   In this proposal, the National Virtual
              Observatory, the  Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Laser Interferometer
              Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Large Hadron Collider
              experiments, all well-presented science projects (two of which have support via
              NSF Major Research Equipment funds)  have data needs appropriate for GRID based
              technologies and are depending on such technologies for the successful
              operations of their experiments.  The experiments will serve as test beds for
              GRID concepts.
