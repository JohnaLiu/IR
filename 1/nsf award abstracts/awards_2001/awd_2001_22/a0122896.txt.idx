Abstract    :
              This program provides financial and academic support for undergraduate students
              in science and mathematics and masters students in computer science,
              mathematics, and statistics. Participants are given an intensive orientation,
              followed by close monitoring throughout the duration of the program. Special
              aspects of the program include internships, group sessions, outside speakers
              relating to the disciplines and possible employment. Expected outcomes for
              undergraduate students are that they are well-prepared for employment in fields
              requiring intensive computer science or mathematics background or for graduate
              programs in these fields. Expected outcomes for graduate students are that they
              obtain a masters degree and employment in a position appropriate to their
              professional training or will continue with doctoral study.
