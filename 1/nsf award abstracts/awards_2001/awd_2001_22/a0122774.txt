Abstract    :
              The Geological Society of America (GSA) Graduate Research Grants Program has
              become one of the largest and most prestigious funding programs for graduate
              students in the geosciences.  The program helps fund field and laboratory costs
              of geoscience projects proposed and conducted by masters and doctoral students
              at universities in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central
              America.

NSF funds would cover about 23% of the Program's total costs.  GSA
              and GSA Foundation will contribute the Program's administration costs; so all
              NSF funding will go directly to students.  GSA is also committed to seeking
              additional funding from non-NSF sources to allow the Program to expand in the
              future.
