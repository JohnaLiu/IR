Abstract    :
              The investigators will study the morphology and small-scale vertical structure
              of intense radar echoes from the polar mesopause.  Possible generation
              mechanisms for these unique echoes, called polar mesospheric summer echoes
              (PMSE), are not well understood, and observations have been limited by the lack
              of needed resolution.  Frequency domain interferometry (FDI) measurements can
              potentially provide information about the vertical structure of the echoes, but
              the technique only works when a single layer is present.  The investigators
              have developed a modified approach called Range Imaging (RIM).  In this
              technique, numerous transmitter frequencies are used and sophisticated
              reconstruction schemes are employed to obtain the desired vertical resolution. 
              The RIM approach will be applied to data obtained from a very high frequency
              radar in Tromso, Norway.  Studying mesospheric chemistry and dynamics is
              important for understanding the temperature structure of the middle atmosphere.
               Middle atmosphere temperature is a sensitive indicator of long-term changes
              associated with global change.
