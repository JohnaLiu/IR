Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support in the amount of $30,000 for an
              eighteen-month study and report on material flow accounting of natural
              resources. Support is also being requested from the following federal agencies:
              Department of Energy, Department of Defense, U.S. Environmental Protection
              Agency, and the U.S. Geological Survey.  Materials flow accounting, which can
              be used to track the flow of a material from the time it is extracted to its
              ultimate disposal, provides a means for making better economic and
              environmental decisions at all process stages.  This study will examine (1) the
              usefulness of creating and maintaining materials flow accounts for developing
              sound public policy on the environment, materials, and energy; (2) the
              technical basis for materials flow analysis; (3) the current state of materials
              flow information, including what data are collected, where it resides, quality,
              scale and completeness of the data, formats, accessibility, and the tools and
              methods available for analyzing the data; (4) the ways the public and private
              sectors are currently using this information and how materials flow accounts
              can be improved through partnerships or access to additional data; and (5) who
              should have institutional responsibility for collecting, maintaining and
              providing access to additional data for materials flow accounts.
