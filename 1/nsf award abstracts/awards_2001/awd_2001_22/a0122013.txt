              ABSTRACT

Integrating Undergraduate Geoscience Education and Research via a 
              Watershed Management Approach

This project enhances undergraduate training
              in the geoscience component of the interdisciplinary Environmental Science
              Program through curriculum development/revision and expanding student research
              training opportunities, with particular focus on watershed management
              approaches. The geoscience component in the Louisiana State University at
              Shreveport (LSUS) Environmental Science Program is enhanced by the inclusion of
              a comprehensive watershed and ecosystems approach in several new and revised
              undergraduate courses. The focus of the curricular enhancement and related
              student research and experiential learning opportunities is on the Red River
              watershed and ecosystems in Louisiana. This project integrates research and
              education, offering undergraduate students interdisciplinary curricular
              education and experiential learning opportunities, and builds upon
              collaborative linkages with partner agencies such as USGS. LSUS students
              participate in public outreach efforts and in publication and dissemination of
              research results via papers and presentations. Dissemination is aided via a
              tri-state Red River Public Radio network, headquartered on campus, and through
              a new inter-agency working group composed of faculty and government agency
              personnel who are developing a broad regional initiative.
