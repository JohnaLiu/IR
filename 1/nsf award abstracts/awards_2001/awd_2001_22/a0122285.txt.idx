Abstract    :
              The SCRSI is an outshoot of the UCAN-RSI. Unsuccessfully attempted as an
              implementation award last year, it has been redesigned and reconsidered as a
              developmental. Anchored at Adams State College in rural Southern Colorado, the
              SCRSI plans to improve science, mathematics and technology education through a
              partnership of 18 school districts, two Boards of Cooperative Educational
              Service Centers (BOCES), two Regional Assistance Centers (RAC) 2 junior
              colleges and 2 four-year colleges.   The school districts encompass 47 K-12
              schools in an economically disadvantaged area with approximately 12,000
              students. Over 75% of the students in the schools are Hispanic. The 47 schools
              are members of three coalitions, the San Luis Valley, the Arkansas Valley and
              the South Central Coalitions.  There are four major components to the
              SCRSI:  1. Creation of an infrastructure for managing the project and
              completing the scope-of-work throughout the established consortium.  Action:
              Establish site-based leadership teams, Coalition leadership teams and project
              leadership teams.  2. Completion of a site analysis of individual schools to
              identify strengths and weaknesses in order to direct future implementation
              strategies. Action: Complete matrices on full implementation and assessment at
              each school, conduct teacher surveys and school walk-throughs, compile and
              analyze student data.  3. Establishment of strong collaboration across
              schools, partnerships and networks across all levels of the region. Action:
              Conduct team meetings and three strategic planning meetings.  4. Development
              of the implementation plan supported by all partners including specific
              partnership commitments. Action: Submit a report and propose an implementation
              plan.
