Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  Development and Implication of New Technologies for Teaching Field
              Geology   The project is developing a digital field geology (DFG) system
              that will enable a new generation of university-level courses in field geology.
               Electronic devices will simplify and accelerate the process of data collection
              in order to give students and instructors the opportunity to focus on critical
              thinking and data analysis in the field.  The DFG system performs automated
              functions that closely emulate and complement traditional field methods,
              provides simple software "smart" tools that will aid in the collection and
              first-order analysis of field data and expedites and facilitates the
              translation of field data to a geographic infomration system (GIS) environment.
               The DFG system incorporates hardware and software advances such as wireless,
              hand-held devices with GPS cards, voice input, and networks links to access
              more powerful computers remotely.  The DFG system is innovative in its
              integration of the latest technologies with a distributed-type architectural
              design.  While particularly well suited to the teaching fo field geology, this
              system should enhance the efficiency of proofessional geologist doing
              field-based research and could be readily adapted for commercial applications. 
              A wesite will distribute software and aid faculty from other universities to
              adopt the DFG system for their courses and offers a forum for discussions on
              best practices for the development of technology-enabled research tools for
              field geology.
