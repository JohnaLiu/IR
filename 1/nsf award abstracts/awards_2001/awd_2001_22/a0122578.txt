Abstract    :
              This is a theoretical investigation of the excitation and scattering of acoustic
              waves by turbulent flames.  Specifically, it examines the acoustic radiation
              characteristics of moving, convoluted flame fronts of various scales of
              roughness.  It also looks at how the spatial and temporal characteristics of
              the scattered and excited waves can be used as a diagnostic of turbulent flame
              fronts.  The study uses a coupled integral equation approach to analyze the
              acoustic field.  The complete solution requires the solution of two such
              equations, describing the field upstream and downstream of the flame, that are
              coupled by mass, momentum, and energy conservation conditions.  Analytical
              solutions are obtained in certain limiting cases, while a numerical
              boundary-element approach is used for analytically intractable cases.  This
              effort complements an experimental study of the same phenomena supported by a
              CAREER award to the principal investigator.
