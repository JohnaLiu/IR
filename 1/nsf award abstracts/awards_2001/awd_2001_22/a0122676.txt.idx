              Abstract   Proposal Title: 	              International Workshop on the
              Electrochemical Promotion of Catalysis Proposal

                    Electric Power Research Institute  A workshop, jointly sponsored with
              EPRI, will be held at the NSF on May 3 - 4.  Eleven speakers will be invited to
              lead the discussion on topics that will include new methods for enhancing the
              activity and selectivity of catalytic processes.  In particular, enhancements
              due to the passage of small electric currents passed through catalysts
              deposited on ionically conducting supports will be discussed.  This discovery
              is called the non-faradaic electrochemical modification of catalytic activity
              (NEMCA).  This phenomenon has been observed empirically to promote industrially
              important reactions such as oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide on 
              supported silver catalysts, oxidation of CO and hydrocarbons on Pt, Pd, and Rh,
              and the isomerization of butene on Pd.  The objectives of this workshop will be
              to address the fundamental issues regarding the basis for the phenomenon and to
              target specific systems of particular industrial interest, which might include
              ammonia synthesis, SO2 oxidation, and NOx reduction.  A workshop report
              detailing the recommendations will be issued in August.
