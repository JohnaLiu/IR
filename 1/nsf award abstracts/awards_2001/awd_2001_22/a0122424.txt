Abstract    :
              Partial support is provided to produce and distribute an issue of Oceanography
              magazine highlighting Dr. John Knauss' contributions to the Marine Sciences on
              the occasion of his 75th birthday. To mark this milestone, The Oceanography
              Society will publish a special issue of Oceanography magazine to honor his many
              contributions to the marine sciences. Topics to be featured include: a
              biography, legacy of Stratton Commission emphasizing Sea Grant and how this
              impacted federal activities, UNOLS and the academic fleet, Physical
              Oceanography at the Equator, Law of the Sea, Advances in Instrumentation, and
              marine education.  Oceanography magazine is in its fourteenth year of
              publication. It is published four times per year, with issues going to the
              worldwide membership as well as to libraries of oceanographic institutions.
