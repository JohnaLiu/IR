Abstract    :
              This project addresses variability of the tropical diurnal tide in the
              mesosphere on timescales of the intraseasonal, or Madden-Julian Oscillation
              (MJO, approximately 30-60 days) and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO,
              approximately 2-10 years).  Low-latitude medium frequency (MF) radar wind
              measurements suggest that diurnal tide amplitudes are modulated on
              intraseasonal (IS) and interannual time scales.  The propagating diurnal tides
              are a strong agent of coupling between the tropical troposphere and the upper
              atmosphere.  Thus, if the forcing of tropospheric diurnal tides undergoes
              systematic, large-scale variations on MJO and ENSO time scales, such
              variability may be transmitted into the upper atmosphere by means of the tide's
              vertical propagation at low latitudes.

The tropical radars at Kauai (22
              degrees N, 159 degrees W) and at Rarotonga (22 degrees S, and 160 degrees W)
              are uniquely situated with almost perfect symmetry around the equator.  These
              are key locations for monitoring the structure and temporal variability of the
              diurnal tide, since they are near the latitude where the tidal wind amplitude
              maximizes.  In addition to supporting scientific analyses of tidal variability,
              this project will provide operational support for the tropical radars.  The
              operational support includes maintenance, system upgrades, minor repairs and
              data archival.  We anticipate that this support would allow the radars to
              operate continuously, reliably and with enhanced capability for the duration of
              the TIMED mission.
