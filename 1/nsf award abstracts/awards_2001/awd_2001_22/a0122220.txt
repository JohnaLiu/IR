Abstract    :
              One of the most fundamental problems in mathematics is that of solving
              polynomial equations. Such systems are ubiquitous in applied mathematics,
              arising in robotics, coding theory, optimization, mathematical biology,
              computer vision, statistics, and numerous other areas. Of course, the study of
              polynomial
systems is a beautiful topic in its own right and is the subject of
              algebraic geometry, which is
traditionally regarded as a deep and difficult
              subject in pure mathematics.

In recent years, an explosive development in
              explicit algorithms and practical software for geometric calculations has
              revolutionized the area, making many formerly inaccessable  problems tractable,
              and providing a fertile ground for experimentation and conjecture. These
              algorithms have also generated a surprising interest in algebraic geometry
              among scientists, engineers, and applied mathematicians. The
tools of the
              trade employed in this field span the spectrum of mathematics, ranging from
              numerical
methods and differential equations to algebraic geometry to
              combinatorics. The purpose of these lectures is to
provide an overview of
              recent results and the ``state of the art''; and to discuss the wealth of open
              questions raised by these results and suggest new directions ripe for
              exploration.
