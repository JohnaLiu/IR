Abstract    :
              Dr. Gray has established an outstanding record in support of minorities and
              especially women in mathematics for more than thirty years at American
              University.  Gray's academic history includes serving as department chair on
              multiple occasions, and as director of the women's studies program, as well as
              an extensive list of publications, including several on mentoring.  The
              American Association for the Advancement of Science recognized her achievements
              in mentoring with its Lifetime mentoring Award.  The American Association of
              University Professors bestowed the Georgina Smith Award on Gray in 1979 for her
              work on the status of women in collective bargaining.  Gray is the founder and
              president of the Association of Women in Mathematics.  

Gray has mentored
              twenty-three students through successful doctoral dissertations, including
              fourteen women and eight African-American students.  She co-directed the
              Patricia Roberts Harris Fellowship program at AU, providing tuition and
              stipends for thirteen doctoral students, including eleven women and five
              minority students.  Her students have gone on to lead illustrious careers,
              including academic administrative posts such as College Dean and Provost, and
              becoming active mentors themselves.
