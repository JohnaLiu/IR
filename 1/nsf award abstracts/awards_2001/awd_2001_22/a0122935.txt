Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for a planning grant that aims to prepare a full proposal in
              the future to develop professional development materials for teachers in the
              area of environmental science.  Most of the funds requested in the planning
              grant are to assemble a group of scientists, science educators (some of whom
              have led the development of national standards in science, math, and geography)
              and teachers for a two-day conference.  The purpose of the conference is to
              develop a synthesis of best practices toward education about the environment. 
              The ultimate goal is to produce a publication (tentatively titled "Resources
              for Environmental Literacy') that will identify the concepts and principles
              every American should know in order to make thoughtful public and private
              choices; to participate in a rational discourse about issues related to the
              environment; and to appreciate the interrelation of the human and natural
              worlds.  This publication will assist teachers by demonstrating how
              environmental knowledge can be achieved through the integration and application
              of learning across the disciplines, on issues that are of considerable interest
              and great importance to students
