Abstract    :
               Geoscience Education Research to Enhance Effective Professional Development
              for In-Service Teachers: New Research Opportunities in the San Diego
              Region  Due to increased demand for Geosciences in schools, there is a surge
              in the demand for geoscience professional development workshops for both pre-
              service and in-service teachers. One of the largest professional development
              programs in California is run by the K-12 Alliance, a multi-agency
              collaborative organization.  The PI and his research group are participating as
              content facilitators and researchers in this program and are assessing portions
              of the project including immediate impacts on classroom practice.  This project
              supports students who will perform some of these assessment activities to
              conduct research on the impact and effectiveness of a new field-based,
              inquiry-driven unit on sedimentary rocks, depositional environments and change
              through time using a well exposed sequence of Eocene through Pleistocene rocks
              at Torrey Pines State Park. All participants undergo pre- and post-test
              summative evaluation, and selected participants will be interviewed before and
              after the field experience, and tracked to measure the impact of the field
              exercise on classroom practice over the coming school year.
