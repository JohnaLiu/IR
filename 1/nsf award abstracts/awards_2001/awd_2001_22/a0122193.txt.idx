               ABSTRACT   Proposal: CMS-0122193 PI: Joachim Hammer	 Institution:
              University of Florida Date: July 21, 2001   ABSTRACT CMS0122193 - "Flexible
              Production Networks Phase II: SEEK - Scalable Extraction of Enterprise
              Knowledge"  This grant provides funding to support development of new theory
              and technologies to allow the seamless, rapid interconnection of diverse legacy
              systems with enterprise decision support tools to allow extraction of data and
              knowledge across those legacy systems. Such a capability is critically
              important to allow rapid configuration of computing systems that support
              extended enterprise collaboration. The application domain is the flexible
              production network. Flexible production networks (FPNs) consist of firms that
              operate in a project oriented, customized production environment. Most
              construction (totaling approximately 8% of GNP) and growing parts of
              manufacturing industry operate in this form. Characterized by rapid assembly
              and disassembly of business networks based on project needs, FPNs are
              particularly well-suited users for the proposed research.  We call our
              technology SEEK - Scalable Extraction of Enterprise Knowledge. Knowledge
              extraction is difficult because data resident in the firm does not map directly
              to the input needed by a decision support system. Existing approaches do not
              support SEEK's fundamental capabilities: (1) rapid connection to legacy data
              and applications with little programmatic setup; and (2) linking source
              knowledge with decision support tools not natively available to the source. Our
              novel approach to provide these capabilities is to use encoded domain knowledge
              about the types of information that would be stored in applications to enable
              semiautomatic connection to those applications. Our approach is application
              independent, supporting extraction of legacy data from both structured and
              unstructured sources. This approach is inherently more scalable and robust than
              building application specific tools. Successful conclusion of our research will
              significantly increase the speed and reduce the amount of human input necessary
              to instantiate an extended enterprise computing platform with heterogeneous
              sources.
