Abstract    :
              Lehigh Carbon Community College (LCCC) is providing scholarships each year
              to
approximately 36 to 50 academically talented, financially needy full-time
              students enrolled in
associate degree programs in the fields of computer
              science, computer technology, engineering,
engineering technology, and
              mathematics. These CSEMS scholarships enable students, including those from
              underrepresented groups, to reduce their dependence on loans to meet their
              living expenses and decrease the number of hours they work, allowing them more
              time to study and receive support services in very demanding disciplines. The
              scholarships are also an incentive for part-time students to enroll full time
              and for students in one-year certificate programs to change their major to an
              associate degree program.
