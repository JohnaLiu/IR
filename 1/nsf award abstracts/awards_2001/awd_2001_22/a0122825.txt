Abstract    :
              This project is annually awarding 29 scholarships to fulltime students majoring
              in computer science, engineering or mathematics. Recipients are
              academically-talented U. S. citizens or nationals, refugee aliens or permanent
              residents with financial need as established by application of the U. S. Dept.
              of Education guidelines. The focus is on students entering their junior year
              and those maintaining a 3.0/4.0 GPA are eligible to have the scholarship
              continued through the senior year. Faculty members are serving as mentors and
              encouraging students to undertake independent research. Travel funds are
              available to students whose research reports are accepted for presentation at
              professional meetings.
