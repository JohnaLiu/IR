Abstract    :
              
This project is creating a cohort of Computer Science, Engineering, and
              Mathematics (CSEMS) scholars and incorporating the CSEMS Scholars Program into
              the college's five-year enrollment enhancement plan. A complete array of
              student support services are being provided to the members of the CSEMS cohort.
              Selection of the scholars is the responsibility of a committee comprised of
              faculty, staff and industry leaders. As a precursor, the college is undertaking
              a diligent and thorough process of recruiting applicants for the program. This
              process includes a conscious and consistent effort to recruit an increased
              number of women for careers in the CSEM areas. As additional support for the
              CSEMS Scholars, internship and business networking opportunities are being
              provided. Group and individual support mechanisms include regularly scheduled
              cohort meetings, academic and career advising, appropriate off-campus
              experiences, presentations by experts in the CSEM fields and a preparation
              course for the GRE or GMAT Exams. Those CSEMS Scholars who express an interest
              in pursuing a career in education are being afforded the opportunity to
              participate in the Teaching Scholars Program.
