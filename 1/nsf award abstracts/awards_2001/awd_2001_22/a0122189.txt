Abstract    :
              This award provides partial funding for expansion and modernization of the
              library at The Darling Marine Center.  The library currently contains more
              marine-related holdings than any other library in Maine, and is an important
              resource for researchers and students interested in the biology of the Gulf of
              Maine and the Maine coast.  Because of current space limitations, a third of
              the library's holdings are stored in other buildings and attic spaces. The
              library is not wheelchair accessible, has no significant study space, and
              provides only limited access to electronic databases. The proposed changes
              include: 1) construction of a 1,500 sq. ft. addition to the main floor of the
              Library, 2) the reallocation and renovation of 1,650 sq. ft. of existing space
              on the main floor and second floor, thus providing a total of total of 3,150
              sq. ft. of additional space for library use, and 3) the purchase of computers,
              interactive videoconferencing hardware, and related equipment that will
              facilitate access to electronic information and data stored electronically. 
              The planned increase in amount and quality of library space, and improvements
              in communications equipment available to library users, will significantly
              improve the ability of this important regional resource to serve the needs of
              resident and visiting faculty, students and other users.
