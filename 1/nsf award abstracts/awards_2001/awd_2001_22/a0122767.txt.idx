Abstract    :
              Scholarships are being awarded to 29 academically talented, low-income students
              majoring in mathematics, computer science and eligible fields of engineering
              technology. The program is providing faculty mentoring to all scholarship
              recipients and tutoring to aid in the transition from high school to university
              level studies. Special efforts are underway to aid the students in overcoming
              the barrier presented by traditionally high attrition rate courses. Both
              cooperative work programs and research participation are available to the
              students.
