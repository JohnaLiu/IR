Abstract    :
              This project involves the measurement of the isotopic and mixing ratios of
              methane and carbon monoxide from a shipboard transect in the Pacific Ocean
              between Los Angeles and New Zealand.  These combined measurements, made through
              four trips per year for three years, will help answer questions related to the
              growth rate of methane in the atmosphere and provide constraints on the overall
              global budgets of methane and carbon monoxide.  The resultant methane data will
              be combined with data from other researchers and used in a 3-D model to
              evaluate the changes concentrations of atmospheric methane and how these
              changes affect the oxidizing power of the atmosphere.  This project involves
              collaboration with a research group in Wellington, New Zealand that is making
              similar measurements and collaboration with the University of Oslo where the
              modeling and analysis will take place.  These collaborations greatly enhance
              the ability of this effort to produce information with broader societal
              relevance, such as developing an improved understanding of the global methane
              budget that has implications for understanding human impact on climate change.
