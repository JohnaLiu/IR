DEB-0122445

Although methyl halides catalyze atmospheric ozone
              depletion, a significant portion of their sources remains undescribed.
              Ectomycorrhizal fungi may account for much of the "missing" source. This
              research will test the hypothesis that anthropogenic nitrogen deposition will
              alter production of methyl halides by ectomycorrhizal fungi, because nitrogen
              additions frequently reduce ectomycorrhizal growth. Nitrogen experiments will
              be conducted at three scales: on laboratory-grown cultures, on excised root
              tips with fungi, and on undisturbed soils in the field. This research will lead
              to refinements in estimates of current global methyl halide production, and
              consideration of consequences of nitrogen deposition for future methyl halide
              emission.
