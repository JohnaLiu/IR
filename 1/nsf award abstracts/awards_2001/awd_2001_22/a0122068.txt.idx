Abstract    :
              PATH:  An Integrated Program to Examine the Moisture-related Performance  of
              Fiber-cement Composites  The effect of wet/dry cycling on fiber-cement
              composites and the resulting mechanisms of damage have not been the subject of
              an extensive systematic examination. This lack of fundamental knowledge limits
              our ability to accurately predict service lives of fiber-cement materials and
              our ability to select materials for fiber-cement composites which are expected
              to exhibit good performance in exposures where moisture fluctuations are
              expected.  A comprehensive research plan is necessary to fully understand the
              implications of fiber swelling/shrinking on the fiber-cement composite system -
              the changes that occur in the fiber, surrounding brittle matrix, and the
              performance of the composite as a whole. The objective of the integrated
              research project, to be undertaken by a research team composed of concrete
              technologists from Civil Engineering and paper physicists from Paper Science
              and Technology, is to link changes that occur on a microstructural level as a
              result of cyclical moisture changes to the changes in macroscale mechanical
              properties of the fiber-cement composite. The goals of the proposed research
              are (1) to assess the effects of repeated wetting and drying (rain and heat)
              cycles on dimensional changes of wood fibers, physical bonding at the
              fiber/cement paste interface, and bond strength between the fiber and matrix
              and (2) to assess if improved bonding can be produced through tailoring the
              fiber processing for this application. The proposal includes preparation of
              special aligned fiber cement-composites that will offer improved opportunities
              for both qualitative and quantitative microstructural analysis.
