              ABSTRACT  A Proposal to Create an Online, Student Managed Journal for
              Undergraduate Research in Marine and Aquatic Sciences  This project launches
              an online, student-managed and reviewed, research journal in the marine and
              aquatic sciences. The journal is published online only, in order to be accessed
              by anyone, anytime, anywhere. It encourages quality undergraduate research by
              providing a publishing forum that is managed by a nationwide community of
              undergraduate learners mentored by faculty and graduate students. Students
              experience the process of scientific publishing from the viewpoints of all
              involved stakeholders, i.e., as authors, peer reviewers, and editorial staff.
              Through its mission, the journal emphasizes to the larger scientific and
              educational community the importance of research experience in undergraduate
              learning.  It also bridges research and learning, by using a research activity
              to enhance learning. The students learn and master communication, networking,
              and critical thinking skills. Graduate mentors benefit through student
              mentorship experience and potentially developing into pedagogically more aware
              geoscience education professionals.
