This award supports Mingdi Yan and students from Portland State
              University in a collaboration with Olof Ramstrom of the Department of Organic
              Chemistry at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.  The
              project will focus on the difficult tasks of synthesis and use of in aqueous
              solutions of tailor-made polymeric receptors that are capable of selectively
              recognizing small differences in ligand structure.  New chemistry and
              fabrication techniques will be applied to molecular imprinting in order to meet
              the challenge, which is of utmost importance in biological applications.  The
              imprinting chemistry employs reversible, but stable bonds that survive the
              water environment.  The technique of micromoulding in capillary will be used
              for the synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymers.  The same technique will
              make it possible to accomplish the synthesis of libraries of such polymers that
              can be screened for optimal imprinting chemistry as well as for biological
              assays.  The long-term goals of the project are to integrate the synthesis and
              analysis of combinatorial molecularly imprinted polymers on a single chip and
              to construct multi-analyte sensors based on the microfabricated arrays.
