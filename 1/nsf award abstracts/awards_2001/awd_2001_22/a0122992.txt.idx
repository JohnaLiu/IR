Abstract    :
              This project is providing scholarships to students who enroll in one of the
              following associate degree programs: Mechanical Design Technology, Electrical
              Engineering Technology, Bio-Medical Electronics, Electromechanical Technology,
              Electronics Technology, Programmer/Analyst, Microcomputer Specialist and
              Network Specialist programs. The objectives of the project are: (1) Over the
              course of four years, to award approximately 160 scholarships, 15% of which are
              awarded to minority students and 40% to women. (2) To have 75% of Computer
              Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CSEM) scholars participate in at least
              one student support service. (3) To assure that 97% of the graduates in the
              CSEM scholarship program obtain employment related to their program or continue
              on to a four-year college.  Recruitment of students for the project includes
              (a) incorporation of an interactive web page to motivate women towards
              occupations in mechanical design and electronics; (b) provision to the
              pre-college minority student program information about the mechanical design,
              computer science and electronics programs and the scholarships available; (c)
              distribution of brochures advertising the project and scholarships; (d) direct
              mailings about the scholarships to program students; (e) classroom
              presentations and distribution to college counselors and instructors, high
              school counselors and high school math and science instructors information and
              scholarship brochures; (f) visits to the high school math and science classes
              by college program instructors to recruit students and distribute CSEMS
              brochures; and (g) distribution of brochures and scholarship applications to
              high school students visiting the college on fieldtrips.  Support and career
              placement services include the college's Academic Success Center, case
              management, specialized tutoring and retention services for students; technical
              support in the electronics, math, or computer labs; designated
              counselor/instructor/scholar appointment; scholar study groups; scholar
              mentorship program; computer science peer tutoring program; internships; and
              special recognition at the annual Foundation Scholarship Dinner.
