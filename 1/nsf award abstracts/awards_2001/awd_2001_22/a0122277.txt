Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding for a workshop on Engineering the Service Sector
              (ESS) to be held at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia.  The workshop will help
              shape a small initiative on ESS planned for the late Fall of 2001 that will
              transition into a new program element within the Division of Design and
              Industrial Innovation (DMII).  Issues include the boundaries of the basic
              research agenda for using engineering tools and problem solving techniques to
              address critical problems in major service industries such as health care,
              finance, retail and transportation, and how solutions already available in
              manufacturing can be adapted to service applications. 

Success with this
              workshop should position the  Division of Design, Manufacture and Industrial
              InnovationI and the National Science Foundation to play a more active role in
              understanding and improving the roughly 80% of the U.S. economy involved in
              service activity, as well as raise new modeling and analysis challenges that
              will yield tools for all engineering.
