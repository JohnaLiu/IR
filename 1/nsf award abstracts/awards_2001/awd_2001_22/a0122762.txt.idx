Abstract    :
              This project is providing scholarships to allow students to pursue degrees in
              mathematics or engineering. The project is also designed to impact two year
              terminal and transfer computer science programs. The overall objective of the
              program is to provide a firm foundation in skills necessary for students to
              transfer from the community college to a four-year university and successfully
              complete a Bachelor's Degree.  The project has four main goals : 1) to
              recruit students to major in computer science, engineering, or mathematics
              (CSEM). 2) to provide students the needed faculty and facilities support to
              major in a CSEM discipline. 3) to use proven educational techniques in
              combination with effective use of instructional technology in a positive
              atmosphere. 4) to retain students as CSEM majors by providing tutoring,
              mentoring and peer support.  This project builds on another NSF supported
              project "Improving Student Learning in PreCalculus and Calculus Through
              Effective Implementation of Technology." This project is enabling the college
              to install a mathematics computer lab which permits the math faculty to
              incorporate lab exercises into precalculus and calculus courses. The grant also
              provides funds for math faculty professional development.  This project is
              designed to recruit and retain students that have the academic ability but lack
              the financial means to attend a university as CSEM major. In particular this
              project is targeting financially needy students from small rural schools.
