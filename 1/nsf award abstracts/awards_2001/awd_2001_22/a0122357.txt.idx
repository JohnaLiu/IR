Abstract    :
              A grant has been awarded to Dr. Wright at the State University of New York at
              Stony Brook to continue the upgrade of the research station at Ranomafana
              National Park.  This upgrade will improve the ability of the station to meet
              its twin goals of training and research.   Annual use of the Ranomafana
              National Park Research Station (RNPRS) in Madagascar has grown from 75 to up to
              182 scientists in the past five years.  However the facilities are too small
              for these usage levels, provide inadequate laboratory facilities for modern
              scientific research techniques, and have no direct communication with the
              international community.   Previous NSF support (DEB-9602577 and DEB-9978270)
              contributed to the planning of the upgrade and the construction of a
              classroom/dining room and administrative complex.  This grant provides funds to
              construct an air-conditioned laboratory to permit modern scientific research
              techniques in this remote rainforest site.  The new laboratory will be
              adjacent to and connected to the Dining/Classroom and Administration building
              being constructed during Phase I.    The building will be three stories high,
              providing 675 m2 of floor space and 150 m2 of veranda.  All labs will have
              sinks, lab benches, ample electrical outlets at 110V and 220V, and locked
              storage.   The labs will be designed to be general-use, but each floor will
              include specialized equipment to address current research needs.  Windows on
              the south side will overlook the scenic Namorona River and the forested
              national park across the river.  Madagascar is one of the world's top ten
              biodiversity hot spots, containing a disproportionately high number of the
              world's plant and animal species for its area.  Most of Madagascar's species
              are endemic (found nowhere else in the world) because the island has been
              separated from the mainland for 88 million years and species have evolved in
              isolation.  The rain forest habitat of Madagascar is severely threatened by
              human activities (logging, slash and burn agriculture, hunting) resulting in
              the disappearance of 79% of the original rain forest habitat.  High species
              diversity, long isolation, high endemicity, and severe threat make Madagascar
              rain forests a focus of intense scientific and conservation interest.   For
              these same reasons, the rain forest at Ranomafana National Park serves as an
              excellent comparison to some of the better-studied rain forest sites in the
              Neotropics, Africa, and Asia.  Ranomafana National Park Research Station is
              located in Ranomafana National Park, which protects 43,500 ha. of rain forest
              in southeast Madagascar.  The station is operated by the Institute for the
              Conservation of Tropical Environments (ICTE), affiliated with the State
              University of New York at Stony Brook.   Over 125 faculty-level researchers and
              over twice that number of students, most from US universities, have conducted
              research at RNP since the station was built in 1989.  The RNPRS is the most
              important center for rain forest research and training in Madagascar and the
              only research station with more than one permanent building.   Research at the
              RNPRS will contribute to local, national, and international understanding of
              the dynamics of this unique rain forest, as well as how to protect it's
              threatened biodiversity.  Training programs at the RNPRS will reach greater
              numbers of US undergraduate and graduate students, and Malagasy students,
              scientists, and policy makers.
