Abstract    :
              The NSF- AWM Travel/Mentor  Grant Program supports the travel of women
              mathematicians who wish to participate in research conferences, as well as,
              longer term visits to work with a mentor.  This program enhances the research
              activities and visibility and advances the careers of women
              mathematicians.

All awards will be determined on a competitive basis by
              selection panels consisting of distinguished mathematicians appointed by AWM .
              An assessment of the results of these travel/mentor grants will be done
              annually.

AWM will administer these regular and mentoring travel grants and
              will continue to attract strong women mathematicians to be involved in all
              aspects of the program . The NSF-AWM  Travel/Mentor Program will promote a
              strong support and recognition for outstanding young women mathematicians, and
              hence it will increase the chance of establishing their research program and
              getting tenure .
