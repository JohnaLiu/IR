Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Hungary research project between Victor Hruby of the University of
              Arizona and Katalin Kover of the University of Debrecen features the study of
              bioactive peptide function.  Specifically, conformations and dynamics of
              oligopeptides, peptide mimetics, proteins and peptide protein complexes in both
              the solution and gas phases will be examined using multi-dimensional NMR,
              tandem mass spectrometry and theoretical methods. The researchers intend to
              examine the role of three-dimensional structures and molecular dynamics in the
              biological activity of peptides and proteins with the goal of better
              understanding the behavior of synthetic oligopeptides, proteins and
              peptide-protein complexes.   If successful, results may yield new information
              leading to the definition of peptidomimetic compounds that are potentially
              useful as reagents or in drug development.

This biophysics research project
              fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
              experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary
              talents and share research resources inn areas of strong mutual interest and
              competence.
