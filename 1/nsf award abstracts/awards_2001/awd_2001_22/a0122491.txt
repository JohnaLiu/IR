Abstract    :
              This international collaborative research project will create advanced digital
              library applications to adapt existing computational linguistic and data mining
              techniques for the special requirements associated with humanities content and
              build an international framework for issues such as the long-term preservation
              of data, metadata standards and interoperability.   The results of the project
              will lower the barriers for researchers and students to reading classical
              Greek, Latin, and old Norse texts.   The suite of applications envisioned
              include multi-lingual information retrieval capabilities, concept
              identification, vocabulary and syntactic parsing tools, text analysis and
              visualization tools, scholar-user text annotation and emendation, and related
              capabilities.   Storage of resources and data will be in numerous locations and
              offer open access via the internet.  This is a international collaborative
              effort involving multiple institutions in the US and European Union
              countries.
