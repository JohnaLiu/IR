Abstract    :
              A grant has been awarded to Dr. Jack Grubaugh at the University of Memphis to
              construct living quarters at the Meeman Biological Field Station (MBFS) in
              Shelby County, Tennessee. The primary missions of the field station are to: 1)
              provide a unique, field-oriented curriculum to urban undergraduate students,
              and 2) serve as a focal point for ecological studies of the lower Mississippi
              River, its floodplains and tributaries. While use of the station as both a
              teaching and research venue has increased over the past five years, development
              of these missions has been hampered by the lack of living quarters to house
              students, instructors, and visiting researchers.  This grant will support the
              first phase of a two-phase plan to provide critically needed living quarters at
              MBFS. This first phase includes the construction of a dormitory to accommodate
              approximately 24 students, instructors, and researchers. In addition, a kitchen
              area and a multi-purpose dining and meeting facility will be constructed in
              this first phase of the project. Thus, the first phase will provide fully
              functional living quarters to support station use. The second phase of
              construction will focus on the development of additional student and faculty
              housing.  This grant will greatly enhance the teaching and research missions
              of MBFS. The living quarters will allow University of Memphis faculty to
              increase the number of field courses taught at the station and to offer courses
              on a year-round basis. Furthermore, housing will eliminate the need for
              time-consuming daily commutes from Memphis in order to conduct on-site research
              or to launch research efforts on the river and floodplains of the lower
              Mississippi Alluvial Valley.
