Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

The project would work with teachers who are involved in the RSI
              reform.  It would provide professional development opportunities to the
              teachers in the RSI schools, and would develop a culturally-relevant,
              standards-based curriculum for reservation schools.  These activities are
              strongly aligned with the goals of the RSI project.  The professional
              development offered to teachers would be heavily content-oriented, with some
              pedagogical training.
