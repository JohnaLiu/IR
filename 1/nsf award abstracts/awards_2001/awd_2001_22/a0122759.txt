This two-year award for US-Spain collaboration on enzyme
              immobilization methodologies giving rise to oriented layers of enzymes leading
              to amperometric biosensor applications involves Hector Abruna and students at
              Cornell University and Encarnacion Lorenzo at the Universidad Autonoma of
              Madrid in Spain.   Enzymes represent some of the most sophisticated catalysts
              known.  Immobilization of active enzymes onto solid substrates can be used to
              generate sensors that exploit these features.  Immobilization approaches tend
              to alter, if not destroy, an enzyme's activity, there is interest in new enzyme
              immobilization methodologies that will allow for the oriented immobilization of
              the enzyme layer while retaining enzymatic activity.

The US researchers
              bring to this collaboration expertise in electrochemical techniques and in the
              synthesis and characterization of transition metal complexes. This is
              complemented by Spanish expertise in the preparation and characterization of a
              variety of sensors and in their application to the analysis of pesticides in
              foods and in environmental samples.   This work, coupling diverse aspects of
              chemistry and biology, will be of interest and utility in environmental studies
              and monitoring of pollutants and in biotechnological applications.
