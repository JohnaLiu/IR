Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to establish a revolutionary new class
              of vertical cavity photonic integrated circuits. The coupling between the
              elements of a 2-dimensional array will be achieved by using defect engineering
              within 2D photonic crystal lattices. Equally important, this research will
              provide a new context to extend the understanding of microcavity physics as
              well as the nano-fabrication techniques for novel optical materials.  Therefore
              highly dense, high performance 2D optical circuits for optical processing
              applications or 2D optical interconnects (suitable for the chip level!) is a
              target of this esearch. However, this research may also have major impact on
              high-performance communication applications, such as for wavelength division
              multiplexing or high-capacity photonic integrated circut for the next
              generation of telecommunications.
