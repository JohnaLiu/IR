Abstract    :
              This program provides scholarships to recruit and retain talented but
              financially disadvantaged students majoring in mathematics and computer
              science. Preference is given to underrepresented and female students. The
              program seeks to improve retention rates, provide academic support for CSEMS
              awardees, utilize CSEMS awardees as tutors and role models, increase the number
              of mathematics and computer science majors coming from families with financial
              need, and link each CSEMS awardee with a faculty adviser/mentor. Additional
              academic support is offered to CSEMS students through faculty mentoring and
              tutoring, the Mathematics Assistance Center, and the University tutorial
              services center.
