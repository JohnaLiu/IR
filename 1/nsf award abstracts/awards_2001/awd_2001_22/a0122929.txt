Abstract    :
              A minimum of 25 scholarships are being awarded annually to academically
              talented, low-income students pursuing degrees in computer science, engineering
              or mathematics. The program is providing faculty mentoring to all scholarship
              recipients and tutoring to aid in the transition from high school to university
              level studies. Undergraduate research in association with a faculty member is
              an integral part of the educational experience and presentation at the annual
              research seminar is expected.
