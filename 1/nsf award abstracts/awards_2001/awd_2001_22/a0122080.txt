              ABSTRACT

Island Institute Islesboro GIS Technology Collaboration

This
              project proposes a three-year pilot project designed to study and then
              implement a community-integrated Geographic Information system with an island
              community in the Penobscot Bay region of Maine.  The project will be developed
              and implemented in conjunction with community members in the school, in the
              local land trust and on municipal committees.

The project implements
              community integrated GIS as it transfers skills from GIS professionals to
              ordinary citizens to empower the community of Islesboro.  A Major goal is to
              integrate GIS technology into the existing community through the school and the
              land trust and the islands' municipal committees. GIS skills and abilities will
              be transferred to the larger community by introducing GIS technology in
              practical day-to-day decision-making at the community level.  The objective is
              to give Isleboro the tools, skills and resources necessary to access and
              utilize scientific data and information for the benefit of sustaining their
              community in the future. The efficacy of this approach will lead to replication
              of the project in other communities.
