Abstract    :
              This scholarship program provides financial, academic, and motivational support
              to enable academically gifted low-income students to receive a bachelor of
              science degree in mathematics. These students are involved in internship and
              research opportunities that make them highly attractive to high technology
              companies. Scholarship recipients also have access to a special mentoring
              program that supplements the strong support systems that are available to all
              students at the university.
