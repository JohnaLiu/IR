Abstract    :
              The main goal of this research is to provide a software development toolkit that
              supports component-based software development. The toolkit will integrate
              component-based  techniques to aid software engineers in developing large
              systems. Large systems will  be able to be built by using existing components
              from a component repository. The figure below provides a view of the
              component-based software development process interfaced with the component
              repository.  In the component-based software development process, a high
              level of the system architecture will be described with an architectural
              description language corresponding  to the problem domain. The architectural
              description of the system should be applicable for architectural description
              analysis. The earlier the errors are detected, the more the development cost
              is reduced. Given an architectural description of the system, a  list of
              component candidates is identified from the component repository in terms of
               the component requirements. In the component composition phase, software
              engineers  assemble the components from the component repository into the
              system and then test  the system. In the whole component-based software
              development process, the component  repository provides services to facilitate
              the retrieval of the components.  We will first research the classifications
              of architectural styles and architectural description languages. The first
              implementation of the toolkit will support only one text-based architectural
              description language.  An editor will be provided for editing the
               architectural description of a system.  An architectural description analysis
              technique  will be provided to aid in the detection of architectural
              errors.  For the first version of the implementation, a simple
              syntax-checking tool will be provided to analyze the syntax errors only.
              Having an architectural description of the system, software engineers will
              identify the components in terms of the component  description in the
              architectural description. This task may need software engineers to  write a
              script of the component requirements to complement the component description
               provided in the architectural description of the system. The more detailed
              the component requirements, the better matched are the components found in the
              component repository. However, at least a list of component candidates will be
              provided to the software engineers.  The component repository will have a
              catalog of the components that reside in the repository for retrieval.
              Finally, software engineers will build and subsequently test the system by
               selecting the components themselves.
