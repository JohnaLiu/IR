Abstract    :
              0122577  Sengupta  The objective of this research is to develop a
              physico-chemical process that has the potential of meeting the twin objectives
              of nitrogen and phosphorus removal from wastewater and generation of a
              high-quality fertilizer.  In this process, a potential gradient is applied
              perpendicular to the flow of a continuous reactor and three different
              ion-exchangers are placed at appropriate electrodes.  These different
              ion-exchangers are selective for ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate ions. The
              specific objectives of this research include: (1) correlation of the potential
              gradient, electrode distance, and the pH profile for efficient operation, (2) a
              study of the effects of background constituents (competing ions) and electrode
              material on process efficiency, (3) a study of ion-exchanger fouling and
              regeneration, and (4) quantification of process performance by mathematical
              modeling of the system with process parameters and solution chemistry as input
              variables. ***
