Abstract    :
              This proposal request support for continuing the publication of D-lib Magazine
              during a transitional period to a new support model.  Since 1995, D-Lib has
              been funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency as a part of the
              Digital Libraries Initiative activities.  Recent changes in DARPA program
              directions now place this activity outside of planned emphases and funding for
              D-Lib has been ended .  D-Lib is only published on the World Wide Web, and is
              widely considered the most influential and respected source of Information on
              digital libraries today.  For the near term, the primary goals will be to
              continue to serve as a source of information and dissemination, while
              simultaneously serve as a testbed for new methods of scientific communication
              and their financial implications.
