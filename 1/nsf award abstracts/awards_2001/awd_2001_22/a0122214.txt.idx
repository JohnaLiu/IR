Abstract    :
              The objective of this Scalable Enterprise Systems award is the creation of an
              agent-based framework for the simulation of product design, marketing and
              supply-chain as collaborative processes. This project will develop the enabling
              theories and technologies needed to support its realization. The framework will
              use computational agents modeling the human behavior, artificial agents
              modeling synthetic economies, and constructive agents to address strategic,
              tactical and operational decision-making problems in simulating product life
              cycle. These agents use both analytic models and adaptive algorithms such as
              generic algorithms, fuzzy logic, and neural networks. The agents will compete
              to provide solutions in these simulations using innovative market metaphors
              such as auctions and recommendation systems. The research tasks include
              requirements analysis, preliminary functional analysis, methodology
              development, initial prototyping, testing, and specifications for the
              framework.   If successful, this research will allow organizations to become
              aligned to and focused on to changing markets and changing customer values. The
              proposed collaborative design framework will test strategies necessary to
              ensure that the product delivery process, the product development process, and
              marketing initiatives are aligned to address the multiple dimensions of
              customer values simultaneously. The results will apply in the modeling of the
              supply chain for convergence technologies and the development of business
              models for electronic bandwidth exchange. The prototype will be used to support
              teaching in several courses in Economics and Management.
