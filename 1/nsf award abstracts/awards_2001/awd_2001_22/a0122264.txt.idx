Abstract    :
              0122264  Figueroa  The objective of this research is to develop an improved
              biological process for the treatment of wastewater with high phosphorus
              content.  This research focuses on improved understanding of the aerobic
              sequence of the enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) process by
              investigating aerobic metabolism as it relates to generating storage and growth
              products from poly-b-hydroxybutyrate.  The specific tasks of this research are:
              (1) to establish and operate a pilot-scale sequencing batch reactor to achieve
              phosphorus removal via a stable, enriched community of phosphate-accumulating
              organisms (PAOs), (2) to complete a series of batch reactor radioactive carbon
              tracer studies involving isolation of intracellular components for PAOs during
              the anaerobic/aerobic EBPR process cycle, (3) to perform mass balances on
              individual samples from the tracer studies, and (4) to test the applicability
              of a proposed metabolic mechanism involved in the EBPR process. ***
