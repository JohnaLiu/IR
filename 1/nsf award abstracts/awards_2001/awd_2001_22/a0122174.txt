Abstract    :
              The District 11 Weather and Earth Studies Program (DEWS) in Community School
              District 11 (CSD 11) is designed to improve the teaching and learning of the
              atmospheric, earth, physical and life sciences in grades 5-8 throughout the
              district.  Beginning in September 2001, an atmospheric/Earth Systems Science
              (ESS) program of science instruction will be in place across these grade
              levels.  The new approach to science instruction involves the use of
              atmospheric science themes as the basis of an integrated and interdisciplinary
              program that unifies the atmospheric, earth, physical and life sciences in
              conformance with the National Science Education Standards, the American
              Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Project 2061 Benchmarks for
              Science Literacy, the New York State Intermediate Level Science Core Curriculum
              Grades 5-8, and the New York City New Standards Performance Standards for
              Science.
