Abstract    :
              0122539 Basu An SGER award supports a study of the feasibility of depositing
              compositionally graded coatings in the mullite-iota alumina system.  The intent
              is to develop coatings which will provide high temperature oxidation and
              corrosion resistance to SiC and Si3N4 ceramics without spalling during thermal
              cycles.  The intent is to CVD deposit a coating which is mullite (3Al2O3.2SiO2)
              at the interface with the ceramic substrate and to gradually change the
              composition to pure alumina of the iota-alumina phase, which has the same
              crystal structure as mullite.  The coatings will be evaluated for crystal
              structure, thermal expansion properties, and high temperature oxidation
              resistance. ***
