Abstract    :
              The research of the PI (Miller) focuses on the analytic theory of automorphic
              forms.  The proposed research concentrates on two analytic tools in the
              subject.  The first is the trace formula.  The PI hopes to sharpen Arthur's
              trace formula for GL(n) so that it can be applied to analytic questions in the
              same fashion that Selberg's original trace formula for GL(2) has been.  One of
              the expected applications is to counting various types of automorphic forms,
              for example a general Weyl law for arithmetic quotients of reductive Lie
              groups.  The second tool is that of automorphic L-functions.  The PI and his
              coworker Wilfried Schmid (Harvard University) are engaged in a research
              program to study automorphic forms using the boundary distributions of
              eigenfunctions on symmetric spaces.  These boundary techniques allow new
              constructions of L-functions, and offer a new way to investigate many problems
              in automorphic forms.  The proposed research involves developing
              this technique and its applications.  The study of automorphic forms slices
              across many important areas of modern mathematical research, including number
              theory, representation theory, geometry, analysis, and mathematical physics. 
              Through L-functions, Langlands has conjectured many deep and
              interesting structural relationships between automorphic forms which have
              implications in the above areas.  As an example, the work of Wiles et al
              demonstrates the link between certain automorphic forms and the ancient
              problem of solving equations between squares and cubes.  The proposed research
              aims to apply and develop new tools for automorphic forms and L-functions
              from analysis, which is the branch of mathematics expanding calculus,
              and representation theory, the concrete study of symmetry. 
              Current applications of automorphic forms and L-functions are manifest
              in constructing the sophisticated codes which enable high-speed and
              secure transactions over the internet.
