Abstract    :
              The objective of this Phase II Scalable Enterprise Systems project is to develop
              a Supply Chain Optimization and Protocol Environment that emulates the behavior
              of supply chains involving multiple, independent, goal-seeking entities over
              time.  Entities will be represented by novel optimization models that capture
              the key decision variables and technological constraints, while retaining
              enough special structure to allow efficient solution.  Interactions among
              entities will be described through protocols that specify what goods, money,
              and information pass among entities, in what order entities make decisions, how
              information is processed by each entity to make its decisions, and how entities
              respond to unforeseen events that do not match their plans.  The approach will
              allow users to represent a range of different modes of interaction among
              entities in the supply chain, which, although simplified relative to industrial
              practice, should provide insights into many cases of practical interest.  By
              focusing on the policy level of analysis, it provides sufficient granularity
              for evaluating high-value supply chain opportunities, and assessing the
              associated risks, unencumbered by the transactional detail of existing modeling
              systems.   If successful, this project would provide managers with a tool for
              rapid prototyping of supply chain proposals that would permit them to evaluate
              possibilities without either implementing an untested idea or waiting for
              competitors to do it and risking loss of market share.  Researchers would be
              provided a test bed for assessing how well theoretically derived results
              generalize to different modes of operation that strain some of the original
              assumptions, and for experimenting with forms of supply chain collaboration too
              complex for treatment analytically.  Educators will be able to explore
              realistic cases with students by varying model parameters and displaying the
              results in near real time.
