              ABSTRACT

Establishing a Digital Library for Earth System Education
              (DLESE)
Evaluation "Toolkit" and Community

This project develops an Earth
              systems education evaluation resource for users of the Digital Library for
              Earth System Education (DLESE) and other geoscience educators. The resource,
              conceptualized as an accessible evaluation "toolkit", is grounded in the needs
              of Earth system educators, and provides a virtual home for a geoscience
              education evaluation
community.  An evaluation resource specifically tied to
              the needs of Earth systems education will enable principal investigators to
              infuse evaluation into their projects more readily, and will provide knowledge
              about how best to engender learning in Earth systems education. This project
              establishes a forum and community for evaluation dialogue within DLESE and
              provides a robust collection of evaluation resources useful for Earth systems
              educators. The resource will be disseminated through the DLESE infrastructure
              and through professional society meetings and workshops.
