Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT: Semicrystalline polymers are of particular interest to the polymer
              community today because of their high performance and low cost 
              characteristics.  It has been shown that control of crystalline morphology can
              result in greatly improved properties.  The emergence of new and more powerful
              characterization techniques has led to new knowledge of structure evolution as
              well as deformation processes in semi-crystalline polymers.  This allows
              theoreticians to perform nanometer scale modeling of deformation and structural
              evolution of semicrystalline polymers. The main objective of this symposium is
              to highlight the latest research and help shape the direction of future
              research in this field.
