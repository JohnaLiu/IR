Abstract    :
              This project will utilize data from the international Geotail satellite to
              examine the properties of the dense sheet of plasma that is found in the
              equatorial region of the Earth's magnetotail.  The work will determine the
              properties of the particle drifts, the pressure tensor, the transport of
              magnetic flux, the structure of the current sheet, field-aligned currents, and
              magnetic reconnection.  The data will be binned according to solar wind and
              geomagnetic parameters in order to determine how the solar wind and the
              interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) control the properties of the plasma sheet.
               Three-dimensional models will be generated for different solar wind and IMF
              conditions.
