Abstract    :
              This project, called the Appalachian Scholars in Computer Science and
              Mathematics (ASCSM) Program, awards scholarships worth $3125 per year to
              low-income, academically talented undergraduate students majoring in
              mathematics or computer science. Incoming freshmen that meet established
              academic and financial criteria are eligible for the awards. Recruitment is
              carried out through high school visits, web page publicity and the annual
              Tennessee Mathematics Contest, which draws up to 1000 Tennessee high school
              students to the campus each fall.

The proposed program addresses two issues:
              1) under-representation of students from low-income families at the university
              and 2) devastating attrition rates for students in lower level mathematics and
              computer science courses. The program builds upon existing student support
              programs, including the mathematics tutorial lab, counseling, and mentoring.
              However, ASCSM scholarship recipients receive additional academic support
              through departmental advising, peer and faculty mentors, and twice monthly
              meetings of scholars.
