Abstract    :
              This program provides non-traditional students majoring in computer science or
              engineering with financial aid in the form of scholarships. A coordinated
              system of faculty advising, mentoring, counseling and tutoring especially
              tailored for the more mature non-traditional student is available to aid the
              student during re-entry to the demands of academic studies. Faculty mentors are
              helping the students connect with regional industry via a program of topical
              talks, professional society meetings, workshops and internships. These
              activities are enhancing the students' employment opportunities.
