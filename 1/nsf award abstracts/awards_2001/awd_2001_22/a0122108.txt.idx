Abstract    :
              Bio-composites from Engineered Natural Fibers  for Housing Panel
              Applications  L. T. Drzal and A. K. Mohanty Composite Materials and
              Structures Center  Michigan State University, MI 48824  This proposal will
              have as its objective, the development of natural fiber (bio-based) composites
              for housing panel applications as an environmentally friendly alternative to
              contemporary synthetic glass fiber - polyester composite materials.  Research
              under this project will investigate the utility of combining surface treated
              bast fibers (e.g., kenaf, hemp) with leaf fibers (e.g. pineapple leaf) in order
              to synergistically obtain the desired mechanical properties of strength,
              stiffness and toughness.  The bast fiber bio-composites alone show high
              flexural/tensile properties while the leaf fiber based bio-composites alone
              show the best impact properties.  The agricultural origin of the biofibers will
              create a new value-added use for pineapple leaf, at present a
              waste/underutilized product.  This project will be executed through effective
              collaboration of University (MSU), a housing panel manufacturing company
              (Kemlite), and a natural fiber company (Flaxcraft) in order to understand the
              changing demand and requirements of paneling systems by industry so that the
              use of bio-composites is maximized.  The fundamental knowledge of the relevant
              structure-processing-property relationships gained will be the basis for the
              commercialization of biocomposites into the housing market.
