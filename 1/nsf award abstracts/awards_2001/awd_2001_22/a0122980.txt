Abstract    :
              Scholarships are available to students majoring in computer science, computer
              engineering, and mathematics. These scholarships are increasing the number of
              students majoring in these disciplines while providing co-curricular support
              leading to improved retention rates and consequently, higher graduation rates.
              The support systems include peer mentoring, study groups, and cooperative
              learning.
