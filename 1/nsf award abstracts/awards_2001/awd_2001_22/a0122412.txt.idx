Abstract    :
              Future embedded real time control systems will increasingly be wireless,
              distributed, large-scale, and will be inherently hybrid, combining discrete or
              digital components with continuous time nonlinear dynamics.  The complexity of
              such networked systems presents new challenges that lie at the confluence of
              communication, computing, and control.  In this proposal we will investigate
              the design and analysis of networked real-time control systems treating
              complexity, delays, reliability, and other issues.  Our goal is to develop
              control strategies for networked control systems that are application
              independent and enable the convergence of sensing and actuation with
              communication and computing.  Potential applications of our results include
              autonomous vehicles and autonomous locomotion systems, remote construction,
              remote surgery, work in hazardous and remote environments, surveillance, search
              and rescue robots, haptic devices, and distance education.    Our research
              will focus on the development of new theoretical tools for analysis and control
              of networked systems with time-varying delays.  On the implementation side, we
              will develop proof-of concept type experiments on in-house designed and built
              systems, including networks of remotely controllable cars and robots.
