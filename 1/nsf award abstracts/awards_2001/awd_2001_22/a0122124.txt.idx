Abstract    :
              NSF PROPOSAL # 0122124, ADVANCED REPLACEMENTS FOR MECHANICAL FASTENERS IN
              HOUSING CONSTRUCTION FOR HIGH WIND ZONES  ABSTRACT  Adhesives offer several
              design benefits over conventional mechanical fasteners including nails and
              rivets.  The acrylic foam tape is a unique adhesive product that requires no
              curing and yet offers substantial property advantages for certain
              semi-structural applications.  Virginia Tech proposes to implement an
              innovative assembly process in the construction industry through the
              development of materials, design, and application databases.  The assembly
              process will be based on generic acrylic foam tapes and the test bed will be
              shear walls and diaphragms in light-frame construction for wind-critical areas,
              a very large market segment.  The assembly process meets PATH (Partnership for
              Advancing Technology in Housing) goals of promoting housing affordability,
              durability, and wind-damage resistance.  PATH's technical areas addressed are
              "advanced panel systems" and "whole-house and building process redesign." The
              fundamental research component of the project will generate material data with
              emphasis on tape durability.  Numerical structural modeling and cyclic tests of
              the assemblies will provide a basis for showing the adequacy of the tape to
              resist the dynamic loads associated with high wind events.  A design
              methodology will be developed to enable field engineers to recommend and direct
              successful tape applications on construction sites.  Shear wall and diaphragm
              models will be constructed for testing and demonstration.   Walls and
              diaphragms will be designed to take full advantage of load re-distribution
              capabilities, increased flexibility and damping, and improved fatigue
              resistance provided by the tapes.  The advantages of the resilient foam tape in
              wind critical applications will be highlighted as meeting the PATH goal of
              improved disaster resistance.  The application of the tape increases overall
              system stiffness, increases the resistance of the roof sheathing to wind uplift
              from hurricane loading, and tape sealing reduces water damage, the major
              property damage under hurricane conditions.  In addition to simplifying the
              assembly/construction process, the design may offer enhanced performance
              including longer life, better appearance, reduced transportation costs, and
              environmentally friendly alternatives over the use of conventional fastening
              systems.  Collaboration with the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)
              through the PATH program will facilitate timely interactions with end users of
              technologies developed in the project and will speed up widespread adoption.  A
              national homebuilder company will build a demonstration home if laboratory
              tests show feasibility.   The output of the project will be materials, joint
              performance, and application data on a simple but innovative assembly process. 
              The databases and demonstration models will be focused on specific applications
              for wind-critical areas but will be applicable to a broad range of advanced
              adhesive tapes for use in housing construction.
