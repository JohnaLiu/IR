Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for construction of two bunkhouse-style
              dormitories, a small laboratory building, a dining/lecture hall and related
              physical improvements at the Indio Mountains Research Station (IMRS).  Funds
              are also provided for a professional-grade weather station that will provide
              short and long term climatic information.  The IMRS occupies 38,000-acres in
              the Chihuahua Desert of west Texas, adjacent to the U.S.- Mexican border.  The
              station, which consists of a former ranch house with three rooms and a small
              storage building, is used by scientists, educators and students from the
              University of Texas at El Paso, Southwest Texas State University, University of
              New Mexico, Sul Ross State University, and El Paso Community College. Use of
              the station is currently at the level of 700 person-days per year, reflecting
              both research and educational uses.  However, use is limited by the relatively
              primitive accommodations and lack of laboratory facilities on site. The planned
              improvements will allow the station to host researchers and provide  education
              activities that require participants to reside at the station for several days
              at a time, and will improve the quality of work that can be done on site.
