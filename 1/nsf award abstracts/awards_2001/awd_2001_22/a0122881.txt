Abstract    :
              While both plant ecophysiology and animal ecophysiology have enjoyed strong
              growth over the past decades, the fields have developed differently,
              accompanied by an increasing gap between plant and animal ecophysiology. Plant
              physiological ecology has increasingly developed links to ecosystem science by
              scaling up physiological process, whereas animal ecophysiologists have
              developed more strongly in the realm of evolutionary physiology.  Despite this,
              both communities study fundamentally similar ecophysiological processes. 
              Researchers and professional society members in the Ecological Society of
              America (one of the principal societies for plant ecophysiology) and in Society
              for Integrative and Comparative Biology (the principal society for animal
              ecophysiology), recognize the problem. They also recognize the gains to both
              fields that will accrue from increased sharing of both methods and
              foci.

This symposium focuses on commonalities and differences in plant,
              animal, and microbial ecophysiology, exploring the benefits of increased
              cross-talk among different communities of researchers.  It will be held at the
              annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America in Madison, WI, in August
              2001.  In addition to reaching participants at this large, widely attended
              meeting, results from the symposium will be published in the journal,
              BioScience.
