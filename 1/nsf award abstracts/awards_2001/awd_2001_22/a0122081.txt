              ABSTRACT

Collaboratory for Oceanographic Research Instrumentation as On-line
              Laboratory Instruction Sources (CORIOLIS)

This project is building and
              testing an on-line instrumented collaboratory for use in college-level
              oceanography courses. The goal is to test the educational merits of conducting
              laboratory exercises online, relative to traditional hands-on access to
              instrumentation. Instrumented systems that can be accessed via the Internet,
              and from which students will be able to remotely control instruments, monitor
              data and sample collection, share and analyze their data, and use links to
              on-line information sources are located at teaching laboratories.  For two
              consecutive semesters, laboratory sections of the same oceanography course will
              be used as test groups (on-line laboratory users) and as control groups
              (in-house labs). The project will be assessed for both technical success
              (construction of a functioning collaboratory) and student outcomes. The
              collaboratory also provides a proof-of-concept for sharing access to expensive
              scientific instrumentation via the Internet (for education or research).
              Sharing allows concentration of expensive resources at centralized on-line
              facilities eliminates the prohibitive costs of purchasing and maintaining
              instrumentation at thousands of educational institutions.
