              Project  FUNDING SOURCE National Science Foundation  PROJECT LOCATION Stone
              Child College, Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation, Montana  LENGTH OF PROPOSED
              PROJECT  January 1, 2002 - December 31, 2002  SHORT DESCRIPTION OF  THE
              POPULATION TO BE  SERVED BY THE PROJECT  The proposal will serve primarily
              American Indian students currently attending or projected to attend Stone Child
              College.  PROJECT OBJECTIVES The overall goal of our project is to ``to
              measurably increase'' the number  of graduates in SMET and related fields at
              SCC by providing a high quality learning environment capable of meeting or
              exceeding the instruction received at four-year institutions. SCC is adamant in
              our belief that in order to attract more students into these disciplines, our
              instructional methodologies, as well as advanced teaching devices, are the key
              to induce student curiosity and eventual enrollment into SMET fields. By
              developing a five-year plan based on research, we believe we can successfully
              pursue other resources for the implementation of our SMET plan. Therefore, SCC
              has developed the following major objective which will guide us during this
              initial 12-month planning process:  Major Project Objective  During the
              project period of January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002, SCC will develop a
              researched-based five-year institutional plan to enhance our SMET program as
              measured by internal and external evaluation results and the plan being
              formally adopted by the SCC Board of Regents prior to the end of the project
              period.  COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS  Stone Child College will coordinate this
              project with our Packard Foundation project, DoD project, MSEIP projects, as
              well as other proposed projects SCC has currently written and are awaiting
              approval/disapproval.  TOTAL FUNDS REQUESTED $50,000. (NSF funds)  PROPOSAL
