This U.S.-Czech project between Bohumil Kasal of North
              Carolina State University and Milos Drdacky of the Czech Institute of
              Theoretical and Applied Mechanics features research, field studies, and
              development of new methodologies for evaluating historic timber structures. 
              The techniques used will combine classical nondestructive methods,
              semi-destructive methods, statistical data analysis and simulation, and
              laboratory verification.  The planned semi-destructive methods measure
              mechanical and physical properties and involve removing micro- wood specimens
              using a core drill and evaluating compression strength to measure the modulus
              of elasticity.   The nondestructive methods employ stress wave timing,
              resistance drilling and digital radioscopy.  The team's overall goal is to
              systematically derive a comprehensive assessment technology for historic
              buildings that can contribute to our knowledge of asset management for wooden
              structures.

This engineering project concerning infrastructural materials
              and structural mechanics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
              knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to
              combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong
              mutual interest and competence.
