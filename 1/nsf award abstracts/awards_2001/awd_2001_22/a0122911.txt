This Americas Program award will support Dr. Ljubinko Lou
              Kondic of the New Jersey Institute of Technology in collaboration with Dr.
              Javier A. Diez of the Institute of Physics of the Universidad Nacional del
              Centro in Tandil, Argentina.  The researchers intend to work on the
              computational and theoretical analysis of the interface dynamics and
              instabilities in thin film flows. 

The main subject of the proposed research
              is to apply existing, and develop new compu- tational methods for a variety of
              problems related to thin film flows. In particular the researchers will
              concentrate on problems where the fundamental issues related to the development
              of instability are still not well understood. This includes thin film flows on
              imperfect surfaces, flows of non-Newtonian fluids, and surfactant flows. They
              also plan to extend computational and theoretical methods to other areas (such
              as spin coating) that are relevant, not only because of challenging theoretical
              and computational issues, but also because of their importance in a variety of
              technological applications.  The research will combine the U.S. researcher's
              expertise with the computational aspects of the project with the Argentinean
              researcher's theoretical expertise.
