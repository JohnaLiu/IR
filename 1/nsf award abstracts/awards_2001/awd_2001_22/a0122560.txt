Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)
This project brings fosters computer science education
              research by providing educators the opportunity to conduct principled,
              large-scale teaching and learning research, to bring them together and build
              upon expertise in research theory, design, and methods, and to support
              practioners when they engage in high-quality computer science education
              research.

This project comprises a set of integrated activities leading to a
              practioner designed experiment kit consisting of the detailed design of a piece
              of research, from methodology to analysis, which is situated within a
              theoretical framework. Practioners develop their kit during a week-long
              workshop in the first year, implement it with support during the academic year
              and re-convene to discuss results and plan for dissemination in the following
              summer.

This project will lead to the improvement of the computer science
              education research community by developing educators skills and by exposing
              them to the relevant theory and methods of educational research.
