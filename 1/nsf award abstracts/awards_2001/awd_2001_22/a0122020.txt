              ABSTRACT

The Rising Tide Project: Changing How University Researchers and
              Secondary Educators Work Together

The Rising Tide Project raises the level
              of scientific awareness and confidence on a local level by making collaboration
              between researchers and educators the norm, rather than the exception.
              Teacher/student teams, each consisting of one local high school teacher and one
              Coastal Carolina University (CCU) undergraduate, work with CCU marine science
              faculty mentors on summer research projects. Each team participates in a
              different local marine-related research project. Using the methodology and data
              from its research experience, each team designs locally relevant discovery and
              inquiry based classroom activities for high school students. Activities are
              designed in a web-based format, tested and assessed in the classroom, and
              incorporated into the South Carolina Aquarium's web site where they become part
              of the Aquarium's statewide aquatic curriculum.  The goals of this program are
              to improve the scientific competence of local high school science teachers and
              enable local high school science teachers to motivate their classrooms by
              incorporating classroom activities based on locally relevant scientific
              research that is pedagogically sound and is consistent with national and state
              standards.
