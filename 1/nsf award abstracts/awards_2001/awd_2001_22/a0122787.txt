Abstract    :
              The Significant Opportunities in Atmospheric Research (SOARS) program of the
              University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR), was established in 1996
              and provides summer internship experiences to minorities and women to enhance
              the professional development of students from underrepresented groups in
              atmospheric and related sciences. Participants complete a research project and
              report their findings to the UCAR community. SOARS also provides up to two
              years of support for graduate education at UCAR-affiliated universities. Since
              1996, SOARS has included 61 student participants, of whom 70.5% are female,
              29.5% are male; the underrepresented ethnic groups include African-American
              (38%,), Chicano/Hispanic/Latino (34%), and American Indian (16%), with
              additional participants who are Euro-American (8%) and Asian-American (3%). The
              program provides mentoring and support of students during critical transitions
              - from 11th and 12th grades through graduate degrees and has achieved a
              retention rate of 80%.

SOARS attributes its success to a highly structured
              mentoring program. During the summer program, SOARS participants work with
              mentors in well-defined and well-documented relationships that include support
              in selecting and engaging in a research program, attending scientific seminars
              at the National Corporation for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and local research
              institutions, a program in science writing, and presenting the outcomes of
              their research at a colloquium. During the academic year, mentoring continues
              through advisory contact and through financial support. Advisors provide
              guidance on academic and personal development, graduate school applications,
              and education and career opportunities. Financial support includes up to 50% of
              costs for two years of graduate school and for travel to professional society
              meetings to give presentations.

SOARS demonstrates long institutional
              commitment with broad-based participation from more than 40 UCAR universities.
