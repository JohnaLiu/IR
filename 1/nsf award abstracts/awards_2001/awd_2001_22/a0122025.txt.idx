Abstract    :
                     Abstract EEC-0122025 Taylor  This project is in partnership
              between the ERC for Computer-Integrated Surgical Systems and Technology (CISST)
              at the Johns Hopkins University and the ERC for Subsurface Sensing and Imaging
              Systems (CenSSIS) at the Northeastern University. The common objective of the
              two collaborating groups is to develop core imaging and computer technologies
              to assist the physician in the treatment of the diseases of human eye. The two
              teams will address the problem of integrating a variety of medical images into
              a common description in the form of a quantitative anatomical atlas of the eye.
              The research is expected to deliver an interventional tool to the correct area
              on the retina, in a manner that maximizes the dosage to the region of interest
              and minimizes the dosage to healthy areas. The expertise of steady hand
              robotics of the Johns Hopkins University will be combined with the expertise in
              subsurface sensing and imaging of the Northeastern University.
