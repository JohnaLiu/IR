Abstract    :
              Blood pressure regulation, salt and water balance, and nervous system control
              are significantly influenced by the kidney.  A hormonal renin
              (ren-1)-angiotensin system in the kidney is critical for appropriate
              regulation, balance, and control.  Ren-1 is upregulated conventionally by a
              cyclic-AMP signal transduction pathway, although the signaling intermediates
              have not been discovered on account of impoverished technology.  Paradoxically,
              ren-1 is downregulated unconventionally by a calcium signal transduction
              pathway, but again the signaling intermediates have not been discovered.  The
              objective of this project is to discover and describe the signaling
              intermediates in the calcium-mediated downregulation of ren-1 gene expression,
              using kidneys and ren-1-producing cells under different stresses to alter the
              calcium signal transduction pathway.  The approaches are to scan kidneys and
              ren-1-producing cells using microarray technology, and to use proteomic tools
              to discover the cluster of genes associated with the calcium-signal
              transduction pathway.  This project will simultaneously screen 2,400
              arbitrarily chosen but verified transcripts against mRNAs from isolated
              perfused kidneys and ren-1-producing cells in culture to define a cluster of
              genes most consistently associated with ren-1 expression. This cluster will be
              used to test the hypothesis that ren-1 downregulation is associated with
              increased expression of not just 2 signaling intermediates as currently
              believed, but with at least 14 other intermediates.  These observations will be
              important not only because it is the first time the intermediates of an
              antagonistic signal transduction system has been measured and described, but
              also because it may clarify the paradoxical molecular nature of calcium and
              ren-1 in blood pressure regulation and salt and water balance.
