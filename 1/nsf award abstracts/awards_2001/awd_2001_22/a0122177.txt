The Latin American Congress on Probability and
              Mathematical Statistics (Congreso Latinoamericano de Probabilidad y Estadistica
              Matematica, (CLAPEM),  will take place during November 12-16,2001 in La Habana,
              Cuba and will be hosted by the Universidad de la Habana. Organizers are Dr.
              Alicia Carriquiry, Iowa State University and Dr. Andrea Rotnizky, Harvard
              School of Public Health.  Applied probability and statistics have only recently
              become important areas of research to areas of inquiry such as biology,
              engineering, and economics, and only recently has Latin America begun serious
              interaction with scientists in other disciplines.  The goal of this activity is
              to provide opportunity to young Latin American and US researchers to establish
              long-term cooperation, and to encourage young Latin American scientists to
              pursue graduate studies in the US.

The activity will include short courses,
              talks, and posters. The short courses will provide the young scientists the
              opportunity to be taught by international leaders in this area, while the
              poster sessions will give them an excellent venue to present their work and to
              interact with more senior conference participants.  It will most likely play a
              significant role in the development of the scientific enterprise in Latin
              America.
