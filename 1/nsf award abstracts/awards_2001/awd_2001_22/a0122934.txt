Abstract    :
              The four-year project provides scholarships to undergraduate students majoring
              in computing and information science. All scholarship recipients will complete
              requirements for the baccalaureate degree by the end of the spring semester
              2006. The program prepares students for the high technology workforce through
              internship participation, involvement in undergraduate research, and
              substantive interaction with mentors from technology fields. Strategies for
              assessing student learning outcomes in the project include portfolios of
              students' academic work, internship evaluations, career placements, and alumni
              surveys.
