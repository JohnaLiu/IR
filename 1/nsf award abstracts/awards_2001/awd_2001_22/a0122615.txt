This US-Mexico award will fund a collaborative project between
              Dr. Gerald Dunne, of the University of Connecticut, in collaboration with Dr.
              Christian Shubert of the Universidad Michoacana in Morelia, Mexico.  The
              researchers aim to study the development of powerful new computational
              techniques in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and quantum electrodynamics (QED),
              with the expectation that they will also apply to physically important
              backgrounds, and to many other situations in quantum field theory and
              gravitational theories.  

The research will involve a blend of analytic and
              computer-based methods, providing a balanced approach that is accessible to
              students. The collaboration will bring together expertise on complementary
              aspects of the proposed research with the partner in Mexico contributing his
              knowledge of the world-line method, while the US partner contributes his
              experience with higher-order derivative expansions and symmetry aspects of
              gauge theories.
