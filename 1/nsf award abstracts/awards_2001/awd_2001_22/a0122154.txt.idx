Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  THE UPPER NEWPORT BAY PROJECT: A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO
              GEOSCIENCE EDUCATION IN THE ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY PROJECT SUMMARY FOR A
              GEOSCIENCE EDUCATION PROPOSAL  This project begins to establish Chapman
              University as the leader in providing the critical scientific data needed for
              responsible policy decisions concerning the Upper Newport Bay (UNB).  UNB
              serves as Orange County's most visible natural environment. Surrounded by
              high-density urban development, the Bay receives pollutants from urban and
              agricultural run-off, marinas, storm water, nurseries, and creeks. Recent
              development in the area has focused public interest on potential impacts in the
              estuary. Yet, the Bay has no centralized environmental data repository. This
              project establishes a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) database of
              scientific (mostly geochemical) data for the Upper Newport Bay in Orange
              County, California, in a manner that maximizes geoscience education in the
              community.   This project establishes a Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
              teaching laboratory at Chapman University, and develops a unit aimed at future
              elementary and intermediate (K-8) school teachers that will combine geoscience
              field and laboratory investigations with use of GIS technology. Term projects
              in two upper division Environmental Sciences courses give students the
              opportunity to do field and laboratory research applied towards a tangible
              product.  A pilot program is designed to give high school science students,
              teachers, and potential future secondary school teachers an opportunity to do
              applied field and laboratory research leading to the presentation of valuable
              data,
