Abstract    :
              This award provides support for construction of housing and docks at two remote
              field stations that are part of a group of stations operated by the Fisheries
              Research Institute of the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, University of
              Washington. The stations are located on two nearly pristine lake systems within
              or adjacent to parks and preserves; their use has  helped provide information
              on the carrying capacities of salmon spawning and rearing environments and
              interactions between salmon and other aquatic species. Research at these field
              stations has expanded in the last decade beyond the historical focus on sockeye
              salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) to include a range of new topics including cycling
              of marine-derived nutrients from salmon carcasses into aquatic and terrestrial
              ecosystems, behavioral and evolutionary ecology, and effects of climate change
              on aquatic ecosystems.  As part of the research, long-term datasets have been
              maintained for juvenile and adult fishes, zooplankton, phytoplankton,
              temperature and other biological and environmental variables, some for over 50
              years. An intensive field course for undergraduate students that covers the
              methods and principles of aquatic ecology is taught each summer. The support
              is intended to improve the infrastructure of these field stations so that their
              teaching and research missions can be expanded. In conjunction with funds from
              the University of Washington, the funds will support construction of a
              multipurpose laboratory/classroom/dormitory facility at the Porcupine Island
              station as well as new docks at both Porcupine Island and the Aleknagik
              station.  These improvements will permit the stations to accommodate a larger
              number of visiting scientists and students, provide space specifically designed
              for teaching, and improve safety by separating laboratories from sleeping
              quarters.
