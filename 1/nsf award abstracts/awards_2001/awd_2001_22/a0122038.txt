Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for a two-day meeting.  The meeting will host system reform
              researchers in science, mathematics emphasizing technology.  These researchers
              represent a number of distinct disciplines including mathematics and science
              education, organization research, technology and policy.  The goal of the
              meeting is to produce a working research framework by taking stock of the
              research from these cross-disciplinary fields.  The framework will bring some
              coherence to the systemic movement from the perspective of research.  The
              deliverable will be a report that compares and contrasts what research models
              work and don't work in an effort to better map this now burgeoning field.  The
              ultimate deliverable will be a series of adaptation studies that will shed
              light on the possibility for research based systemic studies fundable in ROLE's
              quadrant IV.
