              ABSTRACT  Why Some Students have Trouble with Maps & Spatial Representations:
              an On-line Tutorial for Geoscience Faculty  This project develops an on-line
              interactive tutorial which addresses a topic of widespread concern to
              geoscience educators. The topic for the proposed tutorial is maps and related
              spatial representations. Making and interpreting maps and other spatial
              representations is central to most of the geoscience disciplines, yet it is a
              skill that a substantial minority of undergraduates struggles with. Most
              college professors have little or no professional training in how people learn
              or think, and they have little time or infrastructure for professional
              development as educators on the job. Cognitive and developmental researchers
              have extensively studied the cognitive processes that underlie the
              comprehension and generation of maps, but few of those insights have reached
              geoscience faculty.  DLESE has the potential to help this situation by
              providing on-line professional development materials, designed for college
              faculty, focusing on specific problems or issues that arise commonly in
              teaching geoscience concepts and skills.
