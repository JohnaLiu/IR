Abstract    :
              This program provides scholarships for academically talented but needy computer
              science and mathematics majors who are entering their junior year. Particular
              attention is given to recruiting women and minority students. Each CSMES
              scholar is assigned at least one faculty mentor and all scholarship recipients
              will participate in an undergraduate research experience. CSEMS scholars have
              access to the Advanced Computational Laboratory and the Visualization
              Laboratory.
