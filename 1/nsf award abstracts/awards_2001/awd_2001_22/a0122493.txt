Abstract    :
              This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to support research on the
              physical and chemical properties of cloud condensation nuclei.  The experiments
              will be conducted in the winter of 2001-02 at two, or possibly three,
              mountaintop observatories in the southwestern United States.  Central to the
              experiment is a novel instrument called the Cloud Condensation Nuclei Remover
              (CCNR).  It is a thermal gradient diffusion chamber through which an air sample
              is slowly drawn.  It flows as a thin, laminar ribbon between two saturated
              plates having different temperatures.  The supersaturation at the center of the
              chamber is regulated by adjusting the temperatures of the plates.  Depending on
              the supersaturation, some of the aerosols in the sample are activated, grow,
              and settle out as droplets on the bottom of the chamber as the air moves
              through.  The size distribution of the surviving particles is compared with
              that of the particles entering the chamber to determine the sizes of the
              particles that served as centers for cloud condensation.  By comparing electron
              microscope images and the chemical composition of the particles before and
              after exposure to the supersaturation it may be possible to learn more about
              the aerosol particles that are active in cloud formation.  The project is
              designed to resolve the discrepancies that currently exist between observations
              of the physical and chemical properties of aerosol particles and their
              cloud-forming ability.
