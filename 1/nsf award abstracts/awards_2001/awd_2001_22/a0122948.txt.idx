Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT--TMCC LDMT  The project would work with teachers who are involved in
              the RSI reform.  It would provide professional development opportunities to the
              teachers in the RSI schools, and would develop and institutionalize
              standards-based curriculum for reservation schools.  These activities are
              strongly aligned with the goals of the RSI project.  The professional
              development offered to teachers would be heavily content-oriented, with some
              pedagogical training.
