Abstract    :
              This project focuses on recruiting students to high technology disciplines,
              increasing retention through mentoring and support and facilitating career
              placement through industry partnerships. To meet these ends, the School of
              Natural and Applied Sciences (NAS) awards 29 NSF scholarships in each of four
              years in the areas of Computer Science, Computer Information Systems, Computer
              Systems Engineering and Mathematics. A strong mentoring component grounds the
              project. In addition to joining an NSF Scholars Organization, students meet
              with faculty and peer mentors regularly to address academic, career and
              personal progress. Mentoring strategies tap institutional resources as well as
              established industry linkages to further career goals. A Steering Committee,
              composed of industry, community college and institutional representatives,
              ensures effective integration and communication of all project components and
              resources.
