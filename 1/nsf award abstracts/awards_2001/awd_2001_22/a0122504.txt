Abstract    :
              This is a study of char deactivation processes emphasizing surface oxides formed
              from oxidative pyrolysis of coal using four oxidants individually  and in
              combination.  The oxidants are oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitric oxide, and water.
               In addition, rates of scavenging by carbon monoxide are measured.  Oxidation
              and desorption products are monitored using gas chromatography/mass
              spectrometry.  Transient kinetics and temperature-programmed desorption are
              used to charcterize the surface species on the young chars.  Isotopically
              labelled oxidants are used to further identify the mechanisms of char
              formation.
