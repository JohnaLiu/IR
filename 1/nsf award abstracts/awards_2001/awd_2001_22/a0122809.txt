Project Summary
Fort Peck Community College (FPCC), a tribal college,
              is located on the Fort
Peck Reservation in northeastern Montana. FPCC provides
              academic and vocational
programs and community service to the 10,000 members
              of the Assiniboine and Sioux
tribes and area residents. In 1999-2000, FPCC had
              an average enrollment of 233 students.
Approximately 85% of the students are
              Native American - nearly all are enrolled
members of the Sioux and Assiniboine
              Tribes. In June 2000, there were 30 graduates
with Associate Degrees. Of
              these, only 4 (13%) were in science, mathematics,
engineering and technology
              (SMET) disciplines.
Curriculum Enhancement: Objectives and Anticipated
              Outcomes
1-1. By Fall 2003, all entering students will be advised to enroll in
              appropriate levels
of SMET courses based on assessment scores and previous
              achievement.
1-2. By Fall 2004, instructors will have integrated technology
              into 6 introductory
SMET courses.
1-3. By Fall 2005, instructors will have
              integrated technology into 6 advanced SMET
courses.
Faculty Development:
              Objectives and Anticipated Outcomes
2-1. Each year, two SMET instructors will
              attend one regional or one national
conference specifically focused on
              integrating technology into courses according
to national standards.
2-2. By
              Spring 2005, all eight SMET instructors will have completed one semester
              of
faculty exchange or sabbatical at another academic institution or
              national
laboratory.
2-3. By Fall 2003, each SMET instructor will have
              designed and implemented a Web-
based course based on national
              standards.
Undergraduate Training: Objectives and Anticipated Outcomes
3-1.
              By Fall 2003, student enrollment in SMET courses will increase by 10%.
3-2. By
              Fall 2004, ten students will be selected for internship placement in local
              sites.
3-3. By Spring 2005, five students will graduate with SMET majors
              and/or transfers
to four-year institutions.
3-4. By Spring 2006, five
              students will enter SMET careers.
Expected Impact. This project will impact
              the college and reservation in several
ways. Implementation of an appropriate
              system of assessment and student placement in
beginning SMET classes will
              increase the completion rate to 70%. The addition of the
computer laboratories
              and wireless communication will increase the FPCC capacity to
offer additional
              SMET classes and research and increase enrollment in advanced SMET
classes by
              10%. As a result of the student internships, the percent of SMET
              majors
entering math, science and technology careers is expected to increase
              by 10%. The
students assigned to internships will become aware of career
              opportunities in math,
science and computer technology especially in the
              region. The addition of the Web-based
courses, especially advanced courses,
              will further increase enrollment and course
completions. Involvement of the
              Advisory Committee will increase potential training and
service opportunities.
              FPCC will enter into partnerships with tribal businesses and private
companies
              for training and education especially in computer applications.
