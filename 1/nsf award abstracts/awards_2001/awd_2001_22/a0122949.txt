Abstract    :
              The MCIS (Mathematics, Computer Science and Mathematics Education) Department at
              Mississippi Valley State University developed the Odyssey 2001 Scholarship
              program to recruit underrepresented students from the Mississippi Delta region
              of the state. Odyssey 2001 Scholarships help to increase the number of
              community college transfer students at the University and to assist students in
              successfully completing the gatekeeper courses required by CSEM majors.
              Scholars participate in research opportunities and internships before joining
              the workforce at graduation.
