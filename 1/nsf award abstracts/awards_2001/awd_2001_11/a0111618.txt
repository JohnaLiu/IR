Abstract    :
              The research project by co-PI's Dr. Susan M. Lunte, Dr. Kenneth L. Audus and Dr.
              Karen J. Nordheden from the University of Kansas entitled "Microanalytical
              Methods for the Investigation of Metabolism and Transport of Substance P" is
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  There are four
              specific aims in the proposal 1) Continued development in microchip based
              analysis.  The emphasis will be toward  on-line microdialysis with capillary
              electrophoresis and electrochemical detection (CEEC).  2) Monitoring nitric
              oxide (NO) release from microvessel endothelial cells in vivo using
              microdialysis and microchip CEEC.  3) Continued studies on the transport and
              metabolism of Substance P using copper complexation and electrochemical
              detection.  4) The development of a 2-dimensional microchip separation system. 
              This system will be used for the preconcentration and analysis of substance P
              and other peptides.

Dr. Lunte has an established reputation for mentoring
              underrepresented groups and for integrating education and research.  This
              research is multidisciplinary and will have significant impact on the fields of
              separation science, microchip based analyses, neurotransmission and
              neuroregulation.  There is significant potential societal impact from this
              research related to follow-on medical advances.
