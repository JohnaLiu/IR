Abstract    :
              
With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor
              Chiang and her colleagues at the University of California-Davis are carrying
              out studies of the microscopic mechanisms of important model catalytic systems.
               The decomposition of heterocyclic molecules, the cyclization of acetylene to
              benzene, and the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene are the model systems being
              investigated.  The use of scanning probe microscopy in these studies allows
              real space imaging of these reaction processes on the well-characterized
              palladium or platinum surface.  Surface species reactivity is correlated with
              the presence of defects, steps, and co-adsorbates on these surfaces. 
              Comparison of adsorbed species images with theoretically predicted images is
              used to identify the adsorbed species. 

An understanding of the details of
              heterogeneous catalytic reactions is useful for the design and optimization of
              catalytic process chemistry.  Professor Chiang at UC-Davis is using molecular
              resolution scanning probe microscopic methods to examine the details of model
              catalytic reactions in real space.  Adsorbed species reactivity is being
              correlated with the presence of defects, steps, and co-adsorbates on these
              model surfaces.  Information obtained from these studies will be useful in the
              optimization of sulfur and nitrogen removal chemistry in refining petroleum
              feedstocks.
