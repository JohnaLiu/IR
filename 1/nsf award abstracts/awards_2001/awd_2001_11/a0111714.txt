Abstract    :
              Laboratory measurements will be carried out addressing isotope effects in
              reactions relevant to atmospheric processes, including gas and solution phase
              oxidation of SO2 (sulfur dioxide), surface catalyzed oxidation of sulfur
              compounds, and the oxidation of sulfur compounds with NO2 (nitrogen dioxide)
              and NO3 (nitrate radical). The laboratory studies are needed to better
              understand isotopic analysis (sulfur and oxygen) that the PI and his group have
              carried out on atmospheric sulfate and nitrate aerosol samples. The PI is using
              isotopic data to quantify the relative contributions of the different
              atmospheric sulfur oxidation pathways. This is of fundamental importance to
              understanding the chemistry of aerosols and their impact on climate.
