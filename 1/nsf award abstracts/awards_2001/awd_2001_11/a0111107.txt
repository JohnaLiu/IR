Abstract    :
              This proposal for a Small Grant for Exploratory Research outlines a
              collaborative project for in-depth scholarly research on the issues raised for
              science and technology studies (S&TS), as well as for related political and
              legal analysis, by the extraordinary year 2000 US presidential election. The
              project will seek to identify the most salient epistemological and
              sociotechnical dimensions of these issues and will develop a special archival
              collection to support ongoing interdisciplinary research on the 36-day
              post-election developments. The proposal has three key elements: (1) an initial
              planning workshop to be held in Cambridge, MA, at Harvard University's John F.
              Kennedy School of Government; (2) a systematic effort to gather materials, many
              ephemeral, to be housed in a special collection in the Cornell University
              library system; and (3) a follow-up workshop to discuss and refine a group of
              papers emanating from the first two phases of the project. The collaboration
              between the Department of Science & Technology Studies at Cornell University
              and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University will facilitate the
              involvement of a broad range of scholars in creating the collection and
              contribute to productive interactions between science and technology studies
              and more traditional perspectives on government and public policy.
