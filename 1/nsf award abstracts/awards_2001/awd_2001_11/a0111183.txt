This award will supply funding which will be used along
              with cost-sharing funds from Brown University to purchase a new Electron
              Microprobe.  This instrument, with its state of the art analytical and surface
              imaging capability,  will be an analytical centerpiece for a large number of
              research projects carried out by faculty, post-docs, graduate students, and
              undergraduates at Brown and as well as from the nearby University of Rhode
              Island.  Research projects which will make use of the Microprobe include the
              following: (1) studies of minerals and glasses in volcanic rocks collected from
              recently active centers around the world directed at determining the nature and
              timing of processes involved in volcanic eruptions. (2) basic studies of
              diffusion and reaction kinetics in both naturally occurring and synthetic
              geological materials, (3) studies of deformation of geological materials in
              both the brittle and ductile regimes with application to understanding
              earthquakes  fracturing processes in rocks, (4)  studies of plate tectonic
              processes as revealed in the ages of minerals and rocks, and (5) studies of
              rocks and volcanic processes as they occur on other planetary bodies such as
              the Earth's moon and Mars. This research involves approximately ten faculty  at
              Brown, three at nearby URI, and as many as twenty graduate students, five
              post-doctoral fellows, and five to ten undergraduates each year.
