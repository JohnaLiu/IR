The vertebrate eye is a highly complex structure
              that is induced early in development by two different tissue layers. Various
              proteins have been shown to be involved in this process. Bone Morphogenetic
              Proteins (BMPs) belong to the TGF-b superfamily of secreted proteins, which
              have been shown to be crucial for correct vertebrate eye development. In the
              absence of BMP-signalling eyes fail to develop and/or are dramatically reduced
              in size. Experimentally induced over-activation of BMPs change the structure
              and pattern of the eye. A newly described regulator of BMP-signalling is BAMBI,
              an inhibitor of BMP-signaling. BAMBI is active wherever BMPs are functional and
              represents an important component in the regulation of BMP activity. The aim of
              this proposal is to investigate the function of BAMBI in mouse eye development
              by genetically mutating and thereby abolishing the function of BAMBI. The
              second goal of this proposal will be to abolish the function at later stages
              during development, and thus study the function of BAMBI in adult eyes. 

The
              study of the extracellular modulation of BMP-signaling during eye development
              may eventually lead to uncover a new set of interactions that are relevant for
              normal eye development. In addition, the results obtained in mice are likely to
              stimulate research for possible genetic alterations related to BMP-signaling in
              humans with congenital eye malformations.
