Abstract    :
              This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support investigation examines the process
              of representation in American legislatures by focusing on the effect of
              political party system upon legislator roll call decisions. Poole and Rosenthal
              (1997) found that most roll call vote can be explained by a simple one or two
              dimensional model, in which the primary dimension is political ideology.
              However, recent work suggests that this low-dimensional structure tends to
              break down when two-party electoral competition declines.

This dissertation
              explores this apparent linkage between party system and the level of structure
              found in roll call votes by looking at three state legislative chambers. Each
              chamber is characterized by a different party system. Roll call data collected
              from these three states permits the evaluation of hypotheses regarding the
              impact of party electoral competition on the dimensionality of roll call voting
              and the distribution of member ideal points along those dimensions.
