Abstract    :
              It has long been known that crosses between species often fail to produce
              offspring and this failure occurs due to problems with fertilization; sperm of
              one species are incompatible with the reproductive tract or eggs of the other
              species.  However, only recently have biologists begun to study in detail the
              rapidly evolving genes and proteins that govern fertilization incompatibilities
              between species.  The aims of this highly ambitious and multi-faceted project
              are to identify and analyze the fertilization proteins in several groups of
              insects, distinguish the factors that govern the rapid evolution of these
              proteins, evaluate the role of the proteins in isolating closely related
              species, and develop mathematical models of the protein divergence process.   
              	

Although the research focuses on insects, it will have broad application
              to other invertebrates and to vertebrates, including humans, since the patterns
              seen in insects match those of other animal groups.  Problems with
              fertilization plague many human couples.  This research will provide new
              insight into the processes that can give rise to these problems and the
              molecular response to these processes in groups of model organisms.
