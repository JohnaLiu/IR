A 10-kHz diode laser
              illuminator, a high-speed digital camera, and associated optics and control
              software are acquired for use in visualization in a variety of combustion
              studies. Among these are studies of droplet streams and droplet stream flames,
              interacting droplet combustion, flame control, and electrospray flames.
