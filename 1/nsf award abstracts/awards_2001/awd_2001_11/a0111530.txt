Abstract    :
              Indole-3-acetic acid is found in plants in both free and conjugated form.  One
              of the less well-studied forms of conjugated IAA are a unique class of proteins
              where IAA is a prosthetic group attached directly to the protein structure.  An
              increasing body of evidence suggests that regulation of protein stability is
              important to auxin function, thus making these modified proteins of particular
              interest.  The first gene for a protein covalently modified by IAA was recently
              cloned from bean and found to be related to proteins present in several other
              plant species, including the model plant Arabadopsis. Four lines of study will
              further characterize these proteins in plants. 
1) Experiments will define, on
              the molecular level, the expression, regulation and function of the bean 35 kDa
              protein. 
2) Previous studies which focused on bean will be extended, starting
              with cloning the respective genes, to related proteins from species more
              amenable to genetic manipulation, such as Arabadopsis and Medicago.
3)
              IAA-protein gene expression will be analyzed at the tissue and subcellular
              level using reporter genes and immunological techniques.
4) The attachment of
              IAA to the proteins will be analyzed using complex liquid chromatography mass
              spectrometry methods that will allow rapid identification of this class of
              modified proteins. 
These studies should provide the biochemical, tissue and
              molecular information necessary to further understand the possible roles of
              this unique class of modified proteins in relation to phytohormone
              regulation.
