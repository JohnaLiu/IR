Abstract    :
              This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support investigation examines the sources
              of 1) legislator policy "location" on roll call votes, and 2) legislator voting
              consistency, or variance around this location.   The study begins with the
              common wisdom that legislators select a policy location based on their
              constituency, party, and ideology.  However, legislators also decide whether
              their primary goal is to gain re-election, advance within the party, or pursue
              policy outcomes, and this determination impacts their positioning as well.  
              Furthermore, this study posits novel models of mass voting and committee
              assignment behavior that influence legislator location.  

To test the roll
              call model requires an accurate measure of legislator ideology, independent of
              party and constituency, and a determination of legislators' goals.  This
              project surveys 700 former members of the United Sates congress to elicit their
              current ideology and their goals when in office.  Analysis of this data will
              produce unbiased estimates of the impact of constituency, party, and ideology
              on voting behavior.  Next, the study hypotheses that voting consistency is a
              function of district diversity, party heterogeneity, and member ambivalence.  
              The proposed survey will yield measures of member policy ambivalence, and thus
              permit a variance model to be tested for the first time.
