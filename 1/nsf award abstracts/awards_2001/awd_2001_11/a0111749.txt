Abstract    :
              Advances in information technology have provided a broad platform for
              anytime-anywhere interactions, creating significant challenges for leaders to
              lead at a distance and across diverse cultures and settings. Yet, it is not
              uncommon today for people to relay stories of electronic communication that
              they misinterpreted or that caused great distress in their relationships with
              fellow workers. Currently, there is no protocol for technology-mediated
              leadership in virtual teams. In this two-year field study at UNISYS, we will
              explore how virtual teams form, develop trust, and lead themselves to higher
              levels of performance. This study is unique in that most of the literature on
              virtual teams has ignored leadership, which is one of fundamental drivers of
              team performance.
