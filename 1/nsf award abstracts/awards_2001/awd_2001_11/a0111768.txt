Abstract    :
              This Doctoral Dissertation Support investigation examines the way states resolve
              trade disputes and the role international institutions, such as the World Trade
              Organization, play in resolving these disputes. The investigator briefly lays
              out the stages common to most trade disputes and provide evidence to highlight
              the rarity of WTO trade disputes. The bulk of the dissertation involves two
              primary tasks: a) to explain the reasons why states refer only a handful of
              their disputes to international dispute resolution bodies, and b) to assess how
              an international dispute resolution body facilitates the settlement of
              disputes, both during those disputes member states take before the
              international body and those disputes they settle "out of court."

To test
              these research questions the investigator assembles a new dataset on trade
              disputes, which includes information on disputes taken before the WTO and
              NAFTA, as well as information on disputes settled without the involvement of an
              international organization.  A series of statistical analyses and case study
              evidence examines which disputes go before international organizations and how
              the existence of an international judicial body affects international
              cooperation.
