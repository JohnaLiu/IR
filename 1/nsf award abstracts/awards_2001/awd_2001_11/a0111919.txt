                           The future is "unreal"

People often seem to pay little
              attention to the future. They may give future consequences little weight when
              making current decisions about spending or saving money, sticking to a diet,
              exercising, or giving up smoking. Although we know people commonly undervalue
              the future, researchers have little understanding of why this undervaluation
              occurs, particularly why the distant rewards are so weak relative to immediate
              rewards. The present research tests the idea that the distant future appears
              "unreal" - i.e. that people cognitively process future events as if they were
              hypothetical. Therefore they typically pay the future event little attention
              and assign it little value resulting in a very high "implicit" undervaluation.
              When forced to pay attention to an event in the future, as a first-pass people
              first focus on the event alone before incorporating the time information in a
              more analytical second-pass evaluation. The resulting "explicit" undervaluation
              may be much smaller than the proposed implicit undervaluation. The present
              research tests these questions in four experiments using memory, imagery and
              effort to investigate similarities between distant future events and
              hypothetical events. These findings would have significant implications for
              decisions in areas ranging from personal health and finance to education and
              public policy.
