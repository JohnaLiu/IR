Abstract    :
              Ground-based mobile observational facilities have proven to be of great value in
              studying transient atmospheric phenomena such as tornadoes and gust fronts. 
              Under this Small Grant for Exploratory Research, the Principal Investigator
              will begin development of a small, airborne, remotely piloted vehicle.  These
              platforms will be designed to be launched rapidly from ground based mobile
              facilities.  The ultimate objective is to develop a command aircraft, which
              will be controlled from the ground, and several accompanying aircraft that will
              maintain a preprogrammed, fixed orientation to the command aircraft.  Each
              aircraft will carry instruments to measure temperature, pressure and relative
              humidity.  The work under this grant is to develop the software that will
              control the command and one additional "slave" aircraft.  

If this research
              is successful, eventual development of such a measurement system will help
              extend ground-based observations into the vertical dimension and allow
              diagnostic studies that are not currently possible.
