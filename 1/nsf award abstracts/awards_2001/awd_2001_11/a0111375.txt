Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to examine the geographic patterns of genetic
              variation in ponderosa pine and limber pine, with the goal of understanding how
              those geographic patterns were formed. This study takes advantage of unique
              patterns of inheritance in pines. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is inherited
              maternally and is dispersed only short distances in seeds. Chloroplast DNA
              (cpDNA) is inherited paternally, and has the potential to disperse great
              distances in wind-born pollen. Minimal gene flow of mtDNA allows it to detect
              genetic differences evolved between glacial refugia.  High gene flow of cpDNA
              enables it to measure the degree of gene flow among populations. Sequence
              variation of mtDNA and cpDNA will be used to describe the variation across the
              ranges of both species. 

Biologists have studied geographic variation of
              plants and animals for centuries, but advances in molecular techniques have
              dramatically increased the information that can be collected from natural
              populations, and advances in the treatment of the data have dramatically
              increased the information that can be extracted from the data. Analyses of
              mtDNA will allow us to look far back into history, to see how the waxing and
              waning of the glaciers pushed forests across the landscape. Analyses of cpDNA
              will reveal the extent of pollen flow, and allow us to determine whether
              different populations evolve independently, or whether gene flow binds
              populations together, as if the distances among them were an illusion.
