Abstract    :
              Allen Hunter, Department of Chemistry, Youngstown State University, is supported
              jointly by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              (Division of Chemistry) and the Solid State Chemistry and Polymers Program
              (Division of Materials Research) for his research in isonitrile-bridged
              organometallic materials. Rigid rod building
              blocks,-[-trans-Mo(PR3)4(mu-CN-arene-NC)]-, will be condensed with other
              monomers or oligomers to produce well-defined one dimensional structures and
              then linked by central metal atoms/ions to produce star-shaped nanostructured
              materials. Structural and electronic properties can be finely tuned by varying
              the building block components. Structure/property relationships will be
              explored in these materials, particularly the number of arms, the arm length,
              the degree of conjugation down the arms, and the nature of the metal
              vertex.

Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) enables undergraduates
              to gain valuable experience in "hands-on" chemistry and materials science. This
              project also involves local high school teachers in research. In addition to
              these educational benefits, the organometallic polymers have potential
              applications in materials science.
