Abstract    :
              In this project funded by the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry
              Division, Martin Jarrold of Northwestern University will pursue a program of
              research to examine the changes in the melting of a material as it decreases in
              size from a macroscopic to a microscopic scale.  The ion-mobility technique
              will be used to study the melting of metallic cluster ions in the gas phase. 
              Using this method the volume or shape change of a cluster that occurs upon
              melting will be sensed.  Information about the latent heat of fusion will be
              determined using collision-induced dissociation in an ion mobility cell. 
              Measurements will be performed for a variety of metal and alkali-halide
              clusters.  

Very little experimental data is currently available about the
              change in the behavior of melting materials as the size of the bulk material
              shrinks to the nanometer regime.  This research project will provide insight
              into the connection between bulk melting and analogous behavior in very
              small-size systems (fewer than 500 atoms) and should ultimately help explain
              how to prepare nanometer-sized particles.  As such it has implications for
              turning the synthesis of nanoscale structures from an art into a science and
              will affect many aspects of nanotechnology.
