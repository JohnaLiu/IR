Abstract    :
              Using an ultrastable low temperature scanning tunneling microscope, Professor
              Paul S. Weiss of Pennsylvania State University is examining the effects of
              local chemical environment on the chemistry of adsorbed molecules.  With the
              support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Weiss's group is
              imaging and analyzing spatially dependent perturbations of the surface
              electronic structure at adsorbates and surface defects.  Using the ability to
              characterize and control defects in monolayer films, selected molecules are
              inserted into these defects in order to probe the chemistry of these species in
              this local environment.  Single molecule vibrational spectroscopy of the
              adsorbed molecule is carried out as well, using inelastic electron tunneling
              spectroscopy.

The detailed interactions of adsorbed molecules can be
              examined using scanning probe microscopy and inelastic electron tunneling
              spectroscopy.  Professor Weiss and his group at the Pennsylvania State
              University are using these methods to examine the effect of the local chemical
              environment on the chemistry of adsorbed molecules.  This information is useful
              for the fundamental insights it provides for a number of important
              technologies, including molecular electronic devices, micro-sensors, and
              heterogeneous catalysis.
