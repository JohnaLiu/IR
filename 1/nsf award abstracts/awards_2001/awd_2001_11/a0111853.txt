Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
              problem of new non-destructive testing methods.  The research will try to
              develop a smart composite based on inductive coupling.  Objectives include
              successful integration of magnetic material into the composite without causing
              delamination and successful transmission of the signal out of the composite. 
              The result will be a low-cost alternative to embedding sensors in composites
              and will be geared especially for thick composites.

Commercial applications
              may include all types of composites where monitoring is important.  This
              technology will be especially useful for civil structures where thickness of
              composites has often limited monitoring in the past.
