Abstract    :
              M. Frederick Hawthorne, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of
              California Los Angeles, is continuing his research into functionalized
              carboranes with the support of the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
              Chemistry Program. Methylation of carboranes leads to octamethyl derivatives.
              These methyl groups will be functionalized to give "camoflagued carboranes"
              with desirable properties. The methylated carboranes will be studied as ligands
              for electron-deficient transition metals analogous to
              pentamethylcyclopentadienyl.  Direct hydroxylation of boranes provides route
              into other new classes of boron clusters with tunable electronic
              properties.

Carboranes and boranes have interesting structures and have led
              to new insights into bonding. The functionalized clusters studied in this grant
              may have applications in water-soluble catalysis, drug delivery, and molecular
              electronics. The project incorporates synthesis, characterization and materials
              applications, making it an excellent project for training students.
