Abstract    :
              Dr. George Stanley of the Department of Chemistry, Louisiana State University,
              is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
              program of the Chemistry Division, National Science Foundation, for his work on
              the bimetallic cooperativity in homogeneous catalysis, a concept discovered in
              his laboratory that involves a catalyst architecture that implicates two metal
              atoms (in this case rhodium) bridged by a tetraphosphine ligand. This
              architecture has shown remarkable activity and selectivity as a
              hydroformylation catalyst. The work will explore further the bimetallic
              cooperativity and examine whether it can be applied to other bimetallic systems
              and whether it can also be applied to other useful catalytic reactions.

The
              project will have a great impact on industrial catalysis, especially in
              hydroformylation processes. Undergraduate and graduate students will be well
              trained in a variety of areas connected to homogeneous catalysis, highly
              relevant to industrial processes in the production of (new) materials and
              energy. Also, efforts will be made in educational outreach to K-12 audiences
              involving young undergraduates.
