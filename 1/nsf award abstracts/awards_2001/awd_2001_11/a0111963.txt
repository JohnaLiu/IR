Abstract    :
              This project will examine the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation and
              its role in the protection of the rights of citizens. Since 1992, tens of
              thousands of Russian citizens have filed petitions, asking the court to assist
              them in realizing their constitutionally guaranteed rights. In a typical year,
              the court gets more than 10,000 such petitions. While many fall outside court's
              jurisdiction, about half of the petitions raise a constitutional question that
              merits further analysis. And while the court answers few of these petitions
              through formal published decisions on the merits, the court answers every
              letter, trying to clarify petitioners' legal rights on a one-to-one basis or
              assisting in defining the petitioners' legal options without rendering a formal
              decision. The principal investigator will study this developing dialogue about
              rights by drawing a sample of petitions and examining the claims that
              petitioners have made, as well as the court's responses. By studying this
              interaction over the last ten years, this research will trace the emergence of
              constitutional consciousness in Russia in its first post-soviet decade.
