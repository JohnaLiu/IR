Abstract    :
              Protein mutation occurs as part of the evolutionary process, through mutagenesis
              and through post-translational modification.  As yet no resource has been
              developed that permits the systematic study of the effect of all these
              mutations on protein structure, and hence function, even though the literature
              is full of individual instances.  The new resource will contain all relevant
              PDB structures as its starting point and will be updated along with PDB.  A
              prototype has been established at http://pmr.sdsc.edu.  The production resource
              will bring together sequence, structure, and literature information using novel
              information acquisition tools and provide query and visualization tools for
              global analysis of the effects of mutation.  Research in protein structure and
              engineering will be enhanced through using the resource for prediction and for
              confirmation of methods.  The resource will be accessible through the web and
              other users may write software for doing direct querying of the resource.
