This grant provides 50% of the costs of acquiring a Maran
              Ultra NMR core analyzer for the Environmental Geophysics Laboratory currently
              being built at Stanford University.  The instrumentation will be used by the PI
              and graduate students investigating the use of NMR for environmental
              applications.  In addition, it is likely that others will use the analyzer for
              research applications in the petroleum industry.  There is growing interest in
              the use of NMR for characterizing the near-surface of the earth.  The Maran
              analyzer is the central piece of equipment that will be used for laboratory
              studies of the relationship between measured NMR parameters and the basic
              physical and chemical properties of porous geological materials.  The analyzer
              will be used to investigate the link between the NMR time constants and both
              the pore size distribution and tortuosity of materials.  A second focus will be
              on improving the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that control the
              NMR response in geological materials, with an emphasis on determining the role
              of paramagnetic species and the sensitivity to sorbed contaminants.  This
              analyzer will be the first low field instrument of its kind at Stanford
              University, providing the capability to obtain laboratory data at the same
              frequency as that used in the collection of field and borehole data.  The Maran
              analyzer will be housed in the Environmental Geophysics Laboratory, planned for
              construction in the summer of 2001.
