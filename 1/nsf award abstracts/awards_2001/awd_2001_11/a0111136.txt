Abstract    :
              The project is to gather information on pricing policies by interviewing a large
              number of businesspeople responsible for pricing in many different types of
              businesses and then to report the results in articles and a book.  The
              objective is to learn how prices are set and how they are adjusted when demand,
              costs, or financial conditions change.  The hope is to contribute to theories
              of macroeconomics and industrial organization by providing knowledge of price
              formation and of the microeconomic mechanisms linking inflation to the general
              level of economic activity.  I hope also to generate theoretical and empirical
              hypotheses that could be tested using other kinds of information, and
              especially quantitative data.
