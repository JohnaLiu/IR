This grant provides support for the costs of acquiring
              laboratory equipment to study elastic wave multiple scattering and resonance
              ultrasound spectroscopy.  
The equipment includes a vibration-isolated optical
              bench, a 16-bit high-speed digital oscilloscope board, an arbitrary waveform
              generation board, lock-in amplifiers and a low-noise preamplifier.
This new
              equipment will allow us to make a variety of measurements aimed at
              understanding and exploiting multiple-scattering of elastic waves and resonance
              ultrasound, in order to characterize the properties of geologic materials.  The
              new equipment will complement our existing facilities for laser ultrasonics, in
              particular a scanning laser-Doppler vibrometer.  The equipment will be housed
              in the Green Center at the Colorado School of Mines and jointly utilized by the
              Physical Acoustics Laboratory and the Rock Properties Laboratory.  It will also
              be available for use in undergraduate and graduate teaching and research within
              the Geophysics Department at CSM.
