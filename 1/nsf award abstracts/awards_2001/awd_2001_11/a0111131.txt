Abstract    :
              David P. White, Chemistry Department, University of North Carolina at
              Wilmington, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
              Chemistry Program for his work on chiral recognition by organometallic
              complexes. The project incorporates molecular modeling, computational and
              synthetic approaches to better understand stereoselective prochiral olefin
              binding to [(eta-5-C5H4R)Re(CO)(L)(NO)]+ complexes (R = Me, t-Bu, SiMe3, CPh3;
              L=PMe3, PMe2Ph, PMePh2, PPh3).

This award is made under the Research at
              Undergraduate Institutions Program (RUI) and emphasizes the training of
              undergraduate researchers in the complementary tools of synthesis and
              computation. This work on substituted cyclopentadienyl complexes of rhenium may
              also lead to better routes for enantioselective hydrogenation of olefins and
              other chiral transformations.
