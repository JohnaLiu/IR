Use of the geochronometer based on the decay of rhenium (Re)
              to osmium (Os) is rapidly expanding, and there are no reference materials
              certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for
              inter-laboratory comparison.  Advances in chemical and mass spectrometric
              procedures permit high precision determination of Re and Os, even on low-ppt
              level samples.  Molybdenite (MoS2) is uniquely suited for the Re-Os chronometer
              because it commonly contains high concentrations of the parent Re and
              essentially no initial daughter Os.  Thus, the decay of 187Re to 187Os yields
              precise ages, even in very young samples, without correction for initial Os. 
              With increasing demand for Re-Os dating, particularly of molybdenite, the need
              for an accepted reference material for inter-laboratory comparison has become
              crucial.  We propose to calibrate a Re-Os molybdenite reference material,
              working together with University of Alberta and NIST.  The proposed Re-Os
              reference molybdenite is from Henderson, Colorado, the location of a
              well-studied molybdenum deposit.  NIST will physically mix, split, and bottle
              the Henderson molybdenite powder.  Statistically representative sets of samples
              will be analyzed by the AIRIE Lab at Colorado State University and by the
              isotope lab at the University of Alberta.  The distribution of the reference
              material will be fully handled by NIST, and the cost for the molybdenite
              reference material will reflect only the costs incurred by NIST for their part
              of the work.
