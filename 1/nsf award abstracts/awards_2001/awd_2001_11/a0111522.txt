Abstract    :
              Professor Amy Howell in the Department of Chemistry at the University of
              Connecticut is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              for her research into the synthesis and reactivity of 2,3-dimethylenoxetanes
              and 1,5-dioxaspiro[3.2]hexanes.  The conversion of 2,3-dimethylenoxetanes into
              highly functionalized ketones and enynols will be studied and these key
              intermediates will be used in syntheses of rubifolide, a furan cembrane, and a
              new approach to enediynes.  The 1,5-dioxaspiro[3.2]hexanes will be utilized as
              intermediates in  the preparation of nucleoside analogs.  

With the support
              of the Organic and Macromolecular Program, Professor Howell is developing novel
              methods by which certain highly strained organic compounds can be further
              converted to nucleoside analogs and other natural products.  The nucleoside
              analogs may have potential applications as new chemotherapeutic agents.
