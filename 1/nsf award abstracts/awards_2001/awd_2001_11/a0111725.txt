Abstract    :
              As scholars struggle to understand homicide rates from their dangerous highs in
              1990 to their puzzling inconsistency in the late 1990s, long range perspectives
              become more essential. What precedents have there been? When? Where? What can
              we learn from them? Or, is the last decade shift a unique event? This project
              establishes age standardized homicide rates for six large American cities from
              the late nineteenth through the early twentieth century. It uses
              capture-recapture sampling when needed to correct unreliable public health
              reports or other individual level sources known to undercount, such as
              indictment records. When fully complete, the data set will allow the testing of
              several hypotheses related to violence. Did cities converge and begin to
              covary? When is it legitimate to discuss a national rate? Is sex distribution's
              impact on homicides a purely time dependent variable? When does the negative
              relationship between big city size and homicide rates that prevailed in 1900
              change to a positive one? Does internal migration from high (or low), affect
              rates?
