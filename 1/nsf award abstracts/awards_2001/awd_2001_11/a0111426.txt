Abstract    :
              This award provides for acquisition of items of equipment to replace equipment
              presently 
on loan to North Carolina State University from General Motors, the
              U.S. Air Force, and 
NASA.  Items to be acquired are a Nd:YAG pumped dye
              laser, a digital oscilloscope, and 
ultraviolet lenses for existing digital
              cameras.  They are to be used for studies of 
interaction between chemical
              kinetics and fluid dynamics in premixed and diffusion 
flames.
