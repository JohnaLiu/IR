Abstract    :
              David S. Glueck, Department of Chemistry, Dartmouth College, is supported by the
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for his work on
              stereoselective P-C bond formation. Glueck has recently shown that a chiral
              Pd(0) complex catalyzes the asymmetric coupling of a secondary phosphine
              (RR'PH) with an aryl halide (ArX) to give a chiral tertiary phosphine
              (RR'ArP*). The mechanism of this reaction and the factors leading to the high
              stereoselectivity will be explored. One key factor to be studied is the
              relative rate of phosphorus inversion and reductive elimination in Pd phosphido
              complexes. The stereochemistry and diastereoselectivity of transmetalation and
              of reductive elimination will also be examined.

Chiral phosphines are
              frequently used in asymmetric catalytic transformations such as hydrogenation.
              The new "chiral at phosphorus" ligands prepared by Glueck are a complement to
              the better-known "backbone chirality" phosphines where a chiral alkyl group is
              attached to the phosphorus. In addition to these potential industrial
              applications, students working on this project will develop a broad set of
              skills in synthesis, characterization and catalysis.
