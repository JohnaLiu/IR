Nagavajara

This is a planning visit proposal submitted by Dr.
              Suteera Nagavajara, AAAS, to request travel funds to visit Thailand for
              discussions with key Thai officials and researchers about developing a project
              on the ecosystem dynamics and human needs of the Mekong River.  The Mekong
              river basin is one of the most biologically and culturally diverse watersheds. 
              For centuries its riparian network has supported its residents, serving as a
              rich source of diverse foods, as a mode of transport, and as a source of
              irrigation and drinking water.  This visit will aid in the development of the
              AAAS long-term program on ecosystem dynamics and essential human needs.  The
              success of this program can enhance our understanding of one of the most
              important watersheds in Asia.
