Abstract    :
              Dr. Laurence A. Nafie of Syracuse University is funded for his research on small
              achiral ligands as vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) probes of active sites
              in metalloproteins by the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division.
               Improved experimental measurements and theoretical calculations will be used
              to complete the developement of VCD as a sensitive probe of metal-ligand
              active-sites in metalloproteins.  New information about the solution-state
              structure and conformaton of metalloprotein complexes will be generated, and
              new insight into the (1) low-lying electronic structure of associated metal
              centers, (2) protein pocket environments in metalloproteins, and (3) coupling
              of these structural elements to the vibrational modes observed in VCD spectra
              will be obtained.  Such studies will positively impact associated vibrational
              measurement techniques such as IR absorption and resonance Raman scattering in
              metalloprotein complexes.

The use of various spectroscopies to better
              understand protein structure and function is a long-standing goal of
              experimental physical chemistry.  The vibrational circular dichroism studies of
              metalloproteins and associated complexes at Syracuse University will extend our
              structure-function understanding of metalloproteins, so important to energy
              metabolism in biological systems.
