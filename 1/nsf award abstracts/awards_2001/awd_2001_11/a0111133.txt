Abstract    :
              Professor Bruce C. Gibb in the Department of Chemistry at the University of New
              Orleans is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for
              his studies on the synthesis of resorcinol-based cavitands, determination of
              binding constants with various small "guest" substrates, incorporation of a
              Zn(2+) catalytic site into the cavitand, and evaluation of these supramolecular
              hosts' ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of ester substrates.  The
              regioselective hydrolysis of diester guests based on the characteristics of the
              binding site will also be explored.

With the support of the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Gibb will prepare a series of
              large, cyclic organic compounds which have the capacity to bind to various
              smaller substrates.  A catalytic active site similar to that found in the
              enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, will then be attached to the cyclic host compound. 
              These enzyme mimics will be evaluated for their ability to catalyze a similar
              reaction to that of the natural enzyme.  By varying the characteristics of the
              cyclic host's binding cavity, different substrates will be bound to the hosts
              with varying affinities.  This in turn will affect the catalytic rate of these
              compounds with various substrates.
