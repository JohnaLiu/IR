Abstract    :
              Voltage gated channels are one of the ways that materials move into and out of
              cells.  They are important across biology. A channel can either be open or
              closed; the transition is called gating. However, these proteins do not
              crystallize easily and two-dimensional methods have had to be developed to
              consider their structure.  Each channel protein consists of six hydrophobic
              membrane-spanning segments and a membrane insertion region.  

The ability to
              predict or at least have good models for these transmembrane proteins is a
              significant need for the research community.  The techniques for this are now
              just beginning.  At the moment, there are no good homologues to VGC proteins in
              the PDB, because of the difficulty of crystallization.  However, alignment of
              sequence is possible.  Three-dimensional protein homology models will be
              developed from these aligned sequences, using a variety of software packages
              developed by the group.  The resulting tools will be available on the web.  
              Once the first models are made, all similarly aligned proteins can be
              automatically predicted.  This effort will produce models that could be used to
              refine the structure data coming from new studies and methods of considering
              membrane proteins.
