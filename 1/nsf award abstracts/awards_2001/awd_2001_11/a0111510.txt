Particle size distribution of aggregates influences many
              material properties, such as strength, friction, porosity and permeability.
              Grain-size distributions of fine-grained sediment yield important paleoclimate
              proxy data.  Temporal and spatial resolution of particle size distributions can
              be used to infer growth and nucleation rates in crystallite suspensions, and
              sediment sorption properties, as well as aridity and wind strength from
              sediment cores to name a few applications.  In contrast to more traditional
              methods, e.g. sieving, settling, or optical microscopy, laser light scattering
              has emerged as an efficient, accurate, and rapid method for particle size and
              volume distribution of aggregates and suspensions.  We propose to purchase a
              state-of-the-art Coulter LS230 Laser Particle Analyzer, which has an
              unparalleled sensitivity over the range of 0.04 to 2000 microns in a single
              analysis.  We will use two different sample introduction modules, allowing
              measurements in water, organic solvents, oils, or as a dry aggregate.  This
              instrument will be used in sedimentological, geochemical, rock mechanics, and
              reservoir characterization studies that include: strength and permeability
              evolution in fault gouge, microbial influenced nucleation and growth of
              carbonate and sulfate minerals, calibration and quantification of grain-size
              distribution information from borehole image well logs, climate interpretations
              of lacustrine sediment and loessite, and "sanding potential" of seafloor
              boreholes among others.
