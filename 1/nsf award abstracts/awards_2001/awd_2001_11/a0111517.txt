This grant provides partial support for the cost of acquiring
              two liquid scintillation counters and a benzene synthesis system [sample
              preparation] for isotopic studies at Brigham Young University [BYU].  The PI,
              Stephen Nelson, is an Associate Professor in the Department of Geology.  He and
              his colleagues in the department, Alan Mayo, Ron Harris, and Matthew Mabey,
              their students and collaborators will use this facility in support of
              hydrology, paleoclimate, and tectonic studies.  In addition to NSF, BYU is
              sharing 40% of the cost for this system.  The counters and sample preparation
              facilities will be housed in a laboratory that already contains vacuum lines
              and a Finnigan Deltaplus isotope ratio mass spectrometer for stable isotope
              analysis. These counters will be used primarily to make measurements of 14C and
              3H activity in water and 14C activity in organic matter and carbonate
              materials.  One low level and one ultra low level counter will be acquired to
              facilitate both routine counting as well as counting of low activity materials.
               Electrolysis cells will be constructed to permit 3H enrichment where
              necessary.  A majority of the work conducted in this facility will support
              studies of ground water systems, paleoclimate studies, estimates tectonic
              uplift rates, and fault slip rate investigations by BYU geologists and their
              collaborators.  Other departments at BYU provided substantial support for the
              facility, and it is anticipated that this facility will permit faculty and
              students from other departments to expand and augment their research
              capabilities.  The facility will be unique to Utah and it is expected to
              support additional collaborative studies in the geosciences with colleagues in
              Utah and nearby states.
