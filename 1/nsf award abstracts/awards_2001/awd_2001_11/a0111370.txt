Abstract    :
              This award funded by the Chemistry Division renews support for the Laser
              Research Facility (LRF) at the Harrison Spectroscopy Laboratory at MIT directed
              by Professor Michael S. Feld.  The LRF is a shared research facility in which
              physical scientists in chemistry, physics, biology and engineering pursue a
              broad range of problems using lasers and state-of-the-art spectroscopic
              techniques.  The research is focussed in five areas:  multidimensional infrared
              spectroscopy, high sensitivity spectroscopy for combustion and environmental
              science, spectroscopy of nanomaterials, proton-coupled electron transfer, and
              biological spectroscopy.  

The Laser Research Facility features training for
              undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students as well as outreach through
              dissemination of scientific results, topical seminars, and links with local
              schools.  The Laser Research Facility, as a shared facility with
              state-of-the-art equipment and personnel skilled in its use, enables new
              research opportunities to be seized upon and carried out quickly, economically,
              and effectively.  It leads to new collaborations and research programs that
              would not exist in the absence of the facility, sometimes resulting in
              significant discoveries that are unanticipated.
