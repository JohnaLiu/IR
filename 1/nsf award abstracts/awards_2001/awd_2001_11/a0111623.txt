              Summary:  This proposal requests support for a workshop to outline a strategy
              and protocol for constructing a community sediment model (CSM) that will 
              incorporate a series of modules that can be used to simulate evolution of
              landscapes and sedimentary basins on a variety of timescales .  Outcome of the
              workshop will be a document that outlines a strategy and  framework for
              developing and linking the components of the CSM.
