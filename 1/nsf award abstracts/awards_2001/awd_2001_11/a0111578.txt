Abstract    :
              Professor Cammers-Goodwin's research focuses on two biomimetic themes in
              molecular modularity. In one project the development of chiral foldamer-based
              molecular recognition is proposed and the other proposes the exploration of
              molecular encapsulation in the mimicry of the structure and function of viral
              bodies. The synthesis and study of solution-phase conformations of chiral
              oligoureas is planned. The binding phenomena between helical conformations of
              the proposed oligoureas will be studied. The helical conformations of the
              oligoureas will create hydrophilic internal and hydrophobic external molecular
              surface area, which will be useful when the oligoureas are included in
              hydrophobic membranes and on polymeric solid supports to transduce signal.
              These helical macromolecular conformers will possess protic and/or charged
              internal cavities and hydrocarbon-based exteriors. Molecular architecture of
              this sort may find use in chemical sensors or in chiral
              separations.

Molecular motifs will be used to assemble viral-like bodies to
              mimic both the structure and function of real viruses. Encapsulation of anionic
              species is sought in the structural and functional mimicry of natural viral
              particles. Perhaps structural mimicry of viral assemblies will lead to drug
              delivery to cells without the viral pathogenic response.

The Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research of Professor Arthur
              Cammers-Goodwin of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Kentucky.
              Professor Cammers-Goodwin's research addresses the nature of the interaction
              between biological molecules. Professor Cammers-Goodwin's educational
              activities include mentoring students and teaching a new course entitled
              Computational Molecular design.
