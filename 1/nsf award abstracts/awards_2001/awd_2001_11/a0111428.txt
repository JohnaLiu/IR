Abstract    :
                 This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
              program supports research by Professor Vincent L. Pecoraro at the University of
              Michigan on the synthesis of metallomacrocyclic complexes, which utilize metal
              ions as part of a cyclic structure surrounding a central metal ion.  Goals
              include the preparation of chiral metallacrown complexes, selective recognition
              of chiral guest molecules by metallacrown complexes and the modular synthesis
              of chiral solids.

   Chiral or asymmetric molecules occur naturally in
              biology and are also important in new drug synthesis where molecules of
              different chiralities must be quantatively prepared.  This research focuses on
              creating molecular recognition agents that may be employed in new methods for
              the separation of chiral molecules.
