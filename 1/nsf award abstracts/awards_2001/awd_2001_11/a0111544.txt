Abstract    :
              The project seeks to establish effective methods and infrastructure to transform
              an individual long-term ecological research (LTER) site data into a shared
              resource that would be accessible to a wide range of researchers.  The
              scientific community needs to transform data management into information
              management practices that incorporate interoperability and metadata (data about
              the data) standards.  The work with prototype tools will take place within the
              computational framework at San Diego, centered on existing metadata standards,
              such as the Morpho software, in collaboration with the national Center for
              Ecosystem Analysis and Synthesis (CEAS) at Santa Barbara.  New versions of
              Morpho will enable the installation and testing of modules as an integrated
              component.  Similarly, bibliographic software will be implemented using the
              Palmer (Antarctic) site bibliography as a test dataset.  The third type of
              prototype will involve tools for organizational documentation, such as surveys
              and other communication vehicles.
