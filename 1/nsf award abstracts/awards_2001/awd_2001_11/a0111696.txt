Abstract    :
              Dr. Victoria DeRose of the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              of the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for her work on
              investigating interactions between metal ions and RNA (ribonucleic acid) in the
              hammerhead ribozyme, a small catalytic RNA, using spectroscopic methods to
              probe ligands bound to manganese(II) and cadmium(II) positioned at specific
              sites in this ribozyme.

These studies will further our understanding of the
              metal-dependent mechanism of catalysis of ribozymes, which are novel
              biocatalysts, and the contributions of metals to the structure and stability in
              complex RNA systems. Students and post-doctoral associates will be trained in
              an interdisciplinary area that encompasses inorganic, spectroscopic and
              biochemical disciplines.
