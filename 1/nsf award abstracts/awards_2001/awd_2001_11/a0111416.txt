Abstract    :
              The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Division
              of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, supports the research work of Dr.
              Harry Gray (PI) and Dr. John Richards (co-PI) of the Beckman Institute at
              Caltech to develop and apply innovative "intra-complex" electron transfer
              reactions to examine reaction pathways of redox metalloenzymes, a host of
              proteins that have significant biological relevance. 

With this support, a
              new understanding of the chemistry of metalloenzymes will be forthcoming. The
              results from the proposed fundamental study will significantly add to the
              knowledge base that will cut across several disciplines, and will impact
              markedly into biological and biochemical fields. Students and post-doctoral
              associates will gain invaluable experience in a variety of experimental
              techniques and learn insights into interdisciplinary methodologies.
