This grant provides partial support for acquisition of a
              laser extraction system for (U-Th)/He chronometry. Laser heating and gas
              extraction from crystals for (U-Th)/He thermochronometry and geochronometry
              provides significantly lower He blanks, allows very small aliquots (single
              crystals) and very young samples to be dated, dramatically increases sample
              throughput, and allows dating of refractory minerals such as titanite, zircon,
              and garnet. The laser extraction system will be incorporated into a He mass
              spectrometry line and (U-Th)/He dating lab at Yale University, which is
              supported by a new geochemistry lab manager position in the Department of
              Geology and Geophysics, and a new HR-ICP-MS for U-Th determinations. The lab
              will focus on both experimental development of new (U-Th)/He approaches and
              applications, as well as routinely providing low-temperature cooling ages for
              establishing the timing and rates of tectonic and geomorphologic processes and
              dating of volcanic rocks. The laser extraction system will be a critical
              component of this lab, both because of its ability to provide relatively rapid,
              low-blank, He extraction from a wide variety of minerals for experimental and
              methodological studies, as well as its ability to process large numbers of
              routine samples for collaborative research projects (primarily apatite,
              titanite, and zircon He ages for tectonic studies).
