Abstract    :
              Professor William Fenical in the Marine Research Division at the University of
              California, San Diego Scripps Institute is supported by the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies on the defense chemicals
              utilized by marine plants and animals against a diversity of pathogenic
              microbes.  Bioassays for six known algal and invertebrate pathogens will be
              used to assess 1) the inhibition of microbial growth (antibiosis) and 2) the
              inhibition of microbial attachment (anti-settlement).  New assays for
              additional pathogens will continue to be developed.  Structure determination
              studies of several antifungal metabolites are ongoing and characterization of
              new bioactive metabolites discovered during the course of this project will be
              carried out.

With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program, Professor Fenical is isolating organic compounds which marine plants
              and animals use as a chemical defense against various pathogenic microbes. 
              There is a possibility that some of these novel bioactive compounds which
              exhibit antifungal or antibiotic activity may prove useful in controlling human
              infectious diseases.
