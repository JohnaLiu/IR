NARS-Baja: A 5-year Deployment of Broadband Seismic
              Instruments Around the Gulf of California

NARS-Baja is a 5-year deployment
              of seismic instruments along the Baja-California peninsula and Sonora province
              in Mexico. This network fills a gap of seismic instrumentation between
              present-day networks in California and southern Mexico Seismic data from
              NARS-Baja is key to constrain the structure of the crust and mantle and to
              study earthquake faulting in the Gulf of California region, where active
              rifting is taking place. NARS-Baja involves collaboration between the
              California Institute of Technology (Pasadena, USA), CICESE (Ensenada. Mexico),
              and the University of Utrecht (Utrecht, The Netherlands). The first seismic
              instruments of NARS-Baja will be installed in October of 2001.

The NARS-Baja
              network shares many similarities with other passive-source deployments,
              commonly funded by the PASSCAL program of the National Science Foundation. 
              However, in some aspects NARS-Baja stands out.
(1) NARS-Baja will be in
              operation for at least 5 years to ensure that a large seismic database is
              constructed.
(2) NARS-Baja bridges the gap in seismic stations between
              present-day broadband networks in California and the UNAM network in southern
              Mexico.  In combination with these networks, NARS-Baja yields an unprecedented
              3000-km long array along the tectonically active Pacific margin of Mexico and
              California.
(3) The NARS-Baja data will be made available via the Internet
              from the IRIS data center as soon as it is received and checked. This promotes
              involvement by the entire research community.
