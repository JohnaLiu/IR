Abstract    :
              In this project the methodology developed by Tripathi and Kitamura (2000) is
              extended  to test the validity of  conditional moment restrictions. This
              approach, referred  to as the ``smoothed empirical likelihood (SEL)'' approach,
              is an extension of the empirical likelihood (EL) technique developed elsewhere
              in the statistical literature. An extension is necessary because the
              conventional EL approach fails when dealing with conditional moment
              restrictions where the conditioning variables are continuously distributed. 
 
                  It is demonstrated that a likelihood  ratio type test based on the  SEL
              procedure is easy to construct and  straightforward to implement. It is
              asymptotically normal under the null  hypothesis and is able to detect local
              alternatives which converge to the null at rates only slightly slower than the
              parametric rate. A distinguishing feature of the proposed test is that it is
              asymptotically optimal in terms of an average power criterion used by Wald to
              demonstrate the large sample optimality of the parametric likelihood ratio
              statistic.
