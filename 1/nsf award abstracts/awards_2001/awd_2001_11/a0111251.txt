Abstract    :
              In this proposal funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, David Nesbitt of the University of Colorado will pursue a
              program of research on the spectroscopy and dynamics of chemical transients
              using state-resolved techniques.  The project will examine the spectroscopy of
              transient species, quantum state-selected reaction dynamics, and the
              development and exploitation of new methods to interrogate jet-cooled transient
              species.  Jet-cooled radicals, molecular ions, and molecular ion clusters will
              be investigated in slit supersonic discharges using direct absorption infrared
              laser methods.  High sensitivity overtone spectroscopy of clusters and reaction
              dynamics with aligned or oriented reagents will be studied using IR-UV-UV
              triple resonance methods.  The ultrasensitive visible absorption spectroscopy
              of jet-cooled chemical transients will be examined using novel optical
              heterodyne/high finesse cavity methods combined with slit discharge sources. 
              

This research program focuses on short-lived molecules and ions that are
              created under extremely energetic conditions, and thus they usually are not
              found in nature in stable forms.  Besides being of fundamental interest, these
              studies have practical relevance to solving problems in combustion and
              atmospheric chemistry as well as in astrophysical chemistry.
