Abstract    :
              This research will test theories that explain why rates of violent crime vary
              over time and space, including theories that emphasize economic conditions,
              criminal justice practices, and changes in demography. Although considerable
              criminological research, adopting either a cross-sectional or time-series
              approach, has been conducted to evaluate the importance of such characteristics
              in explaining violent crime, the understanding of these key factors remains
              limited. The most important factors affecting variation in homicide rates over
              time appear to differ from those affecting spatial variation. The principal
              investigator will explore these disparities by combining spatial and temporal
              information on homicide rates from 1970 to 1996 for all counties with a
              population of at least 100,000.  This research will provide a more precise
              gauge for law enforcement agencies and the public in predicting future trends
              in homicide levels and may suggest approaches to crime fighting.
