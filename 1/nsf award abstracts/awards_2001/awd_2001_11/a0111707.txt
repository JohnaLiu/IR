Abstract    :
              Five countries in the world possess completely digitized individual-level
              censuses for the late nineteenth century:  Canada, Great Britain, Iceland,
              Norway, and the United States.  At the end of the nineteenth century, these
              five nations had close economic ties, shared migration flows, and were
              undergoing rapid social, economic, and demographic transitions.  The
              availability of census data for these nations and this time period thus creates
              unprecedented opportunities for international collaborative and comparative
              social research.  The data sets allow for study of topics such as the
              employment of women and children, domestic service, boarding and lodging,
              marriage patterns, living arrangements of the aged and children, employment by
              industry and occupation, self-employment, and internal migration.  Moreover,
              because the data sets contain information on entire populations rather than
              samples, they allow for the study of small and dispersed population
              subgroups.

However, taking advantage of the opportunities to use these data
              to advance research in a variety of fields requires collaboration among five
              organizations that have been central to the creation and dissemination of the
              data in the five countries.  Funding agencies have already supported the
              collection of the data, but comparative research requires synchronized efforts
              among the five organizations to make the data comparable.  This project
              provides for synchronization by completing the following tasks: developing
              common classification systems for the variables, creating web-based software
              that allows researchers in multiple countries to share coding information,
              documenting the comparability of variable definitions and coding, creating
              machine-readable data, and disseminating the data to researchers through
              mirrored websites in each country.
