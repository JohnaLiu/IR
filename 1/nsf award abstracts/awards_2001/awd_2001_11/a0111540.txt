Abstract    :
              The Electronic Field Guide Project will provide a web-accessible, distributed
              object-oriented database for the identification of biological specimens and
              also electronic methods to record field observations.  The system uses Personal
              Digital Assistants (PDAs), either alone or in conjunction with GPS units.  The
              data management and software technologies are extensible and can be used by
              other developers for new applications or to add value. The user interface is
              designed for communicating with humans, but the rest of the software is
              machine-based.  The components will enable users to discover and integrate
              biodiversity data anywhere on the internet, convey information about quality of
              the data, and deal with data that may be sensitive.  Using XML, the components
              provide access to a wide variety of biological collection data sources, as well
              as to much government and museum data sources.  Three communities of user
              partners are involved in the development and testing, including field
              biologists, naturalist educators, and community science projects.
