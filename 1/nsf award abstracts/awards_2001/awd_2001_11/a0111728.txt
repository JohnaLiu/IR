Abstract    :
              Professor Harry Tom of the University of California Riverside is supported by
              the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to use terahertz spectroscopy to
              study hydrogen bonded liquids and the solid/liquid interface.  Time-domain
              terahertz spectroscopy will be improved by extending the range to as low as
              0.002 THz using instrumental and data analysis advances.  Secondly the low
              frequency features will be analyzed using memory kernal formalism to extract
              collective molecular orientation, angular velocity, and potentially also
              cross-coupling strengths.  These methods will be used to study ionic solutions
              as well as solutions of increasingly complex molecules leading up to
              biomolecules such as DNA.   Lastly, THz pump and time-resolved second harmonic
              generation will be developed for the study of solid/liquid interfaces (namely,
              phenol derivatives adsorbed at the water/silica interface).  

Terahertz
              spectroscopy has only recently come on the scene as a new method for probing
              very low frequency motions, and this new information promises to be of
              importance in understanding condensed liquids, interfaces, as well as
              biological media.
