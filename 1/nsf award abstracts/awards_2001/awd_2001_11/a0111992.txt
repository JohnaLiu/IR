Abstract    :
              This project examines the question of how and why states adopt particular prison
              policies. Current theories of imprisonment do not examine the processes by
              which state actors adopt prison policies, and social policy analysts largely
              ignore punishment as an area of inquiry. This doctoral dissertation research
              will fill this gap by developing a comparative-historical analysis of prison
              policy adoption, variation, and change in the American states from 1970-2000. 
              The researcher conceptualizes the practices of imprisonment as a social policy,
              because like social welfare, imprisonment is a means by which states manage
              risky populations; it is a state policy that affects structural inequality,
              unemployment, poverty, and crime. The researcher employs a synthetic approach
              that relies heavily on political institutionalist and state--centered
              theoretical frameworks.  The historical pattern of prison policy variation and
              outcomes has implications for contemporary corrections policy.
