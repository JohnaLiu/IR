This award, provided by the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics
              Program of the Office of Polar Programs, supports US scientific participation
              in a workshop of the international Antarctic Offshore Acoustic Stratigraphy
              (ANTOSTRAT) program. ANTOSTRAT is sponsored by the Scientific Committee on
              Antarctic Research (SCAR) and it represents an important community-based group
              for discussing emerging research issues related to the long-term history of the
              Antarctic and its ice sheets. The program focuses on coordinated efforts to
              understand Antarctic paleoenvironments and paleoclimates of the last 130
              million years (late Mesozoic and Cenozoic) as recorded in sediments and
              structures on the continental margin and in the surrounding ocean basins. The
              ANTOSTRAT activity has been instrumental in achieving several successful Ocean
              Drilling Program (ODP) drilling legs. This workshop will facilitate integration
              of results from ODP Legs 178 and 188 with results from the Cape Roberts Project
              and other related projects. In addition, the program aspires to delineate
              scientific target areas for potential drilling and to define the drilling
              technologies that will be required to further advance our understanding of this
              important time in Earth's history. This workshop will be held in Erice
              (Sicily), Italy, in September 2001.
