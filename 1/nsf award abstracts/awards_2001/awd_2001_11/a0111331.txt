Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to produce
              transgenic citrus and rice plants carrying novel gene fusions for the purpose
              of controlling citrus canker and rice blight disease.  The fusions consist
              mainly of peptide aptamers and single chain variable region fragments from
              monoclonal antibodies (SCFVs) that bind to and interfere with bacterial
              pathogenicity (Pth) proteins that must be injected by the pathogens into host
              cells to cause disease.  Fusions will be selected that show improved binding at
              physiologically appropriate pH and temperature ranges by BIAcore analyses.
              Binding affinities of aptamer SCFV fusions over a range of pH and temperatures
              will be determined.

The Phase II project will lead to a new, cost-effective
              genetic method to control a variety of important plant diseases caused by
              bacterial plant pathogens.  Commercial potential would be to the agricultural
              and forest industries.
