Abstract    :
              This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support investigation examines standardized
              survey interview procedures to determine if these procedures depress
              respondents' motivation and ability to engage in effortful thinking, by
              alienating, confusing. and rushing respondents through the interview. The
              investigator tests this interviewer-respondent interaction with three
              complementary survey experiments.  These experiments provide different means of
              exploring how to induce effortful thinking, how to detect it, and how to
              determine its effects.  The experiments compare political opinions constructed
              under standardized procedures with those constructed under "ideal conditions"
              that are designed to encourage effortful processing.
