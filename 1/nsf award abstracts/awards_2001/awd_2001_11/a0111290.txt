Kempchinsky & Slabakova 0111290

The National Science Foundation
              supports the Workshop on Syntax, Semantics, and Acquisition of Aspect to be
              held at the University of Iowa in 2002. The goal of this workshop is to bring
              several intellectual threads together and to stimulate communication across
              sub-disciplines of linguistics that investigate aspect. Presenters will be
              selected on the basis of anonymously reviewed abstracts. The papers of all
              presenters will be eligible for inclusion in an edited volume, and the workshop
              findings will be disseminated on the web.
