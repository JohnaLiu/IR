Abstract    :
              Dr. Mark A. Johnson of Yale University is funded for his research on
              spectroscopic studies of anion hydration and intracluster photoreactions by the
              Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division.  Survey spectra of band
              origins via a mass-selected argon matrix isolation scheme will be recorded and
              analyzed.  The clusters studied will be grown in an argon cluster and mass
              selected before its spectrum is scanned with an IR laser.  When the laser is
              tuned to a resonance of the embedded complex, the absorpotion of a photon leads
              to heating.  Evaporation of several argon atoms leads to cooling.  Mass is
              readily determined by mass spectrometry.  The structure and assembly mechanism
              for hydration and small water network formation around dihalides, trihalides,
              and organic functional groups such as carboxylates will be elucidated in such
              survey spectra.  The fine structure hidden beneath argon-mediated spectra at
              rotational resolution will be obtained by using two-color laser methods, and
              the rotational structure will be used to refine the structures of the
              complexes.

The solvation of anions by water molecules is one of the most
              basic aspects of physical chemistry and an extremely important phenomenon in
              nature and everyday life (e.g., the use of salt to clear highways of snow and
              ice is an important public safety issue in the northeast).  The detailed and
              simple hydration reactions that will be studied will greatly advance our
              understanding of hydration chemistry and how to study similar complexes and
              chemistry involving other compounds.
