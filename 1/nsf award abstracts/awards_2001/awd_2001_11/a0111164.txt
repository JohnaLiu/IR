Abstract    :
              This award to the University of California at Berkeley supports the work of
              Professor Jeffrey R. Long, Department of Chemistry, aimed at the synthesis and
              characterization of expanded clusters using multinuclear cyanometalates as
              building blocks to make open frame and microporous materials. These clusters
              prepared by solution chemistry, after dehydration will result in porous
              materials with large void volumes and without loss of structural integrity.
              Cluster-cores with edge-bridged octahedral geometry will be prepared from
              cobalt, zirconium and other metal chlorides with boron or beryllium for
              potential applications in ion exchange reactions, porous magnets and chemical
              sensors.  In addition, inclusion properties of pores will be modified for
              specific applications. Students involved in this project will learn advanced
              synthetic methods and will gain interdisciplinary experience in chemistry,
              materials, and physics relevant to nanoscience and engineering.

Porous
              clusters with large void spaces, open-framework and microporous solids will be
              robust and reusable.  These clusters may be functionalized with inclusion
              groups for different applications such as ion exchange reactions, porous
              magnets for separations, and sensors for volatile organic compounds. In
              addition, students involved in the project will gain experience in solid state
              and inorganic chemistry.
