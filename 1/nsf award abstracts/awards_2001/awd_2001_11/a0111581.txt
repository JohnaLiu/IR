Abstract    :
              The PIs will investigate the effect of including the hydrodynamic effects due to
              the large lakes in east Africa on climate variability of the region. Prior work
              by the PIs has demonstrated that the hydrodynamics of Lake Victoria plays a
              critical role in determining the coupled variability of the lake and regional
              climate. Adopting the traditional approach in which the model formulation is
              entirely based on thermodynamics and the motion in the lake is neglected, has
              not proven satisfactory for this region. The PIs will also study the role of
              coastal Indian Ocean thermodynamic forcing on climate variability of the
              region. In addition, the physical mechanisms responsible for extreme climate
              conditions over east Africa during the recent 1997-1998 El Nino Southern
              Oscillation event will be examined. There is strong educational collaboration
              related to this research between University of Nairobi, Kenya, and University
              of North Carolina Raleigh. The work is important because it will lead to better
              understanding of regional climate variability over east Africa. This has
              important societal benefits.
