Abstract    :
              The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Division
              of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, supports the work of Dr. Marcetta
              Darensbourg (Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M) directed at delineating
              structure/function relationships for Ni/Fe and Fe-only hydrogenase enzymes
              through the use of synthetic model systems. Specifically, the PI (i) will
              develop synthetic routes to amine-containing S--S bridges in iron carbonyl
              compounds, (ii) will use functionalized diphosphine ligands as "models of the
              models" for the hydrogenase active site, (iii) will explore the hydrogen
              activation chemistry of (-SR'S)Fe2(CO)6 compounds that possess a functionalized
              S--S bridge, and (iv) will explore the organometallic chemistry relevant to
              active site cluster synthesis for the hydrogenase enzyme.

Students mentored
              by Prof. Darensbourg are poised to make a real and significant contribution to
              the scientific infrastructure of the country. Their work will have a lasting
              impact on both the biochemical and chemical communities. The results will help
              in initiating efforts to design a cheaper industrial process to produce
              hydrogen, a potential clean source of energy.
