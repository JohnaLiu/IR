Abstract    :
              
Scientists at the Kansas State University Plant Resistance to
              Insects
Laboratory have identified several molecular markers linked to
              genes
expressing resistance to the Russian wheat aphid, a serious pest of
              cereal
grain crops in Africa, North America, and South America.  In order
              to
conduct more detailed research, the Principal Investigator of this Minority
              Career Advancement Award, Dr. Smith, will obtain hands-on research training
in
              the use of RFLP marker linkage analysis, cDNA cloning, and cDNA and
              BAC
sequencing.  The specific new skills to be acquired will be plant RNA
              and
plasmid DNA isolation, Southern and Northern blotting and
              hybridization,
construction of a subtractive cDNA library, and sequence
              analysis of DNA
clones. Experiments will be conducted during the training that
              will provide
information about the linkages of various RFLP loci to the Dn6
              Russian wheat
aphid resistance gene, and initial information about possible
              DNA sequences
related to Dn6.  Thus, this information will serve as a starting
              point for
further research on aphid resistance gene sequences.  Dr. Smith will
              also
attend a course in bioinformatics at Kansas State University and attend
              two
continuing education conferences which emphasize bioinformatics. 
              Knowledge
gained from these educational activities will be used to update
              three
courses dealing with plant resistance to pests in which Dr. Smith serves
              as
instructor or co-instructor.  Information and experience derived from
              the
research and training objectives of the current proposal will
              provide
students enrolled in these courses current information on plant
              genomics,
bioinformatics, and gene sequencing.

RFLP - restriction fragment
