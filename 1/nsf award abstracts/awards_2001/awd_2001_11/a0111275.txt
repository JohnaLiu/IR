Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, explores the mechanisms and kinetics of the reactions of chlorinated
              hydrocarbons on iron and palladium surfaces.  Using a unique suite of
              experimental tools, including laser induced thermal desorption and reflection
              absorption infrared spectroscopy, developed in Professor Donald P. Land's
              laboratory, Land and his colleagues at the University of California-Davis are
              obtaining kinetic information about the decomposition of chloroethylenes on
              well characterized iron and palladium in ultra-high vacuum.  These model
              studies promise a fundamental understanding of reactions that are important in
              wastewater remediation chemistry.  In addition, the work provides basic
              molecular level information about an important class of surface reactions.
              

The decomposition of chlorine containing hydrocarbon compounds is of
              significant relevance to the remediation of wastewaters and ground waters in
              industrialized areas.  The work carried out in this project at the University
              of California-Davis is exploring the detailed molecular mechanisms of these
              reactions on well characterized metal surfaces.  The insight gained from these
              studies will enhance clean-up strategies, as well as provide fundamental
              understanding of an important class of surface reactions.
