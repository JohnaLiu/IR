Abstract    :
              ith the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
              Grant R. Krow, of the Department of Chemistry at Temple University, is studying
              a novel rearrangement route of 1,2-dihydropyridines to
              2-azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes.  The scope and generality of this method will be
              explored with regard to the enantioselectivity, regioselectivity, and
              stereoselectivity.  Target azabicyclic compounds will include methanoprolines
              as potential collagen mimics, aryl and aryloxyamines as potential 
              antinociceptive nicotinic receptor agonists, and diamine subunits for the
              preparation of potential fluroroquinolone antibacterial agents.

Professor
              Grant R. Krow in the Department of Chemistry at Temple University is studying a
              new synthetic procedure for constructing nitrogen-containing bicyclic organic
              compounds.  This compounds will be used as building blocks for potential new
              antibacterial agents and may prove useful in preparing pharmaceutical agents
              for diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
