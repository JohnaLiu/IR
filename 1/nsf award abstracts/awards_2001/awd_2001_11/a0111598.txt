The PI
              requests funding for the purchase of a high-resolution stereoscopic particle
              image velocimetry.   This system will be used to characterize complex turbulent
              flows at very small scales in four different projects under the directions of
              the PI and the three Co-PI's.  The projects include atmospheric boundary
              layers, relationship between interfacial mass transfer and free-surface
              turbulence, effect of small-scale motion on biological systems, and two phase
              flows associated with partial cavitation. All four investigators have currently
              funded projects in each of the four proposed fields of study and research
              studies are in active progress.
