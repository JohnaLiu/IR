Abstract    :
              Professor Patty Wisian-Neilson in the Department of Chemistry at Southern
              Methodist University is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program for her studies on the preparation of a series of grafted poly
              (alkyl/arylphosphazenes) using anionic, ring opening, and atom radical transfer
              polymerization and characterization of their fundamental properties by NMR
              spectroscopy, elemental analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, thermal
              gravimetric analysis, and gel permeation chromatography. The number, length,
              and type of graft will be systematically varied and correlated to their
              physical properties.  Gas permeability, flammability, and the ability to
              stabilize and organize inorganic nanoparticles will be closely examined by
              standard ASTM flammability tests, permeation studies involving gas
              chromatography, and transmission electron microscopy, respectively.

With the
              support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
              Wisian-Neilson will prepare a series of inorganic polymers and examine their
              fundamental properties such as thermal stability, solubility in common organic
              solvents, miscibility, gas permeability, and flame retardancy.  The ability of
              these polymers to stabilize and organize metal and semiconductor nanoparticles
              (particles with nanometer dimensions) will also be investigated.
