Abstract    :
              The ultimate goal is to build a mathematical model that captures the cross-talk
              between cell proliferation and cell death signaling pathways.  The focus of the
              proposed work is on the Ras/Raf and P13K/Akt pathways.  Preliminary data will
              be gathered that investigates and illustrates the cross-talk between these
              pathways.  With an improved understanding and a mathematical description
              in-hand, an improved base for optimizing cell culture or developing
              pharmaceutical compounds can be envisioned.
