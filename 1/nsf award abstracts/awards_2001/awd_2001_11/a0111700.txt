Abstract    :
              Since the passage of the 1988 Constitution, the prosecutors of the Brazilian
              Public Ministry have become the "watchdogs" of environmental agencies, bringing
              investigations and lawsuits on behalf of the public interest against agencies
              that neglect their enforcement duties. This research seeks to determine whether
              a new model of environmental regulation has emerged in Brazil capable of
              stemming the under-enforcement of environmental laws. Two questions are asked:
              (1) How do Brazilian environmental agencies and the Public Ministry differ in
              their approaches to the enforcement of environmental law? and (2) How have the
              enforcement practices of Brazilian environmental agencies been reshaped by the
              Public Ministry's environmental "watchdog" activities? The researcher will
              conduct nine months of field research in two Brazilian states, Sao Paulo and
              Para, using ethnographic and quantitative data collection methods. The research
              contributes to three academic literatures: the sociolegal and political science
              literature on comparative regulatory institutions; the sociological literature
              on state capacity in developing countries; and scholarship on the
              democratization of Brazilian legal institutions.
