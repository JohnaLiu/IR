This grant provides partial support to build a 24-node dual
              processor PC Cluster for geodynamic modeling in the geophysics group at the
              University of Colorado. The PC cluster will be used by the PI, Shijie Zhong,
              and his group to model viscoelastic deformation for Earth's mantle with 3-D
              mechanical structure (a project currently funded by the NSF), 3-D thermal
              convection with temperature-and stress-dependent rheology, and other
              geophysical problems. The PC cluster will benefit geodetic and gravity modeling
              and seismic modeling in our geophysics group (Professors John Wahr and Mike
              Ritzwoller). It will also help us in high performance education for
              undergraduate and graduate students.  The PC cluster may have the following
              features: 24 nodes each with two Pentium III 866 MHz processors (dual
              processor), 10-100 bps fast Ethernet communication, and 2 Gbytes RAM and 20
              Gbytes disk space per node (total 48 Gbytes RAM and 480 Gbytes disk space for
              the cluster). We will mainly use the 3-D spherical finite element software
              CitcomS on the proposed cluster. CitcomS is a piece of software that we have
              developed specifically for studying thermal convection and viscoelastic
              deformation. CitcomS has been proven highly efficient on parallel computers
              including PC clusters. CitcomS along with the PC cluster will enable us to
              tackle various geodynamic problems with adequate accuracy and
              resolution.
