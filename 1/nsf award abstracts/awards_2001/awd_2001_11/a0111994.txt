Abstract    :
              
This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support investigation examines the causes
              of cabinet instability in the presidential regimes of Latin America. The
              appointment of a president's cabinet and its subsequent performance generally
              get a high level of attention both from observers of current politics and from
              scholars. Notwithstanding the general perception that cabinet turnover is
              important in determining the outcomes of the policy making process, there has
              been little work done that discusses the causes of instability, that suggests
              theoretical arguments about the relationship between these factors and cabinet
              turnover, and that tests these arguments empirically in the context of
              presidential political systems. This project tackles these issues by proposing
              a theory that relates institutional features of the political environment and
              the rate of cabinet turnover in presidential regimes. The research has testable
              hypotheses and uses original data on cabinet changes to test them in 11 Latin
              American countries. This data set will contribute to the debate on cabinet
              stability by providing a means to measure different conceptions of turnover and
              relate these to the institutional context.
