Abstract    :
              The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this award to
              University of California San Diego.  With the award, Professor William Trogler
              will study different methods such as photochemistry, chemical reduction,
              electro-polymerization and thermal polymerization to prepare new layered
              polymeric materials based on carbon diselenides, which will be free from
              elemental selenium. Doped thin films prepared from poly (carbonselenide)s will
              be studied for electrochemical, electronic conductivity and chemical redox
              properties. Complexation of cadmium with poly (carbondiselenide) at the surface
              would produce cadmium selenide nanoparticles and quantum dots with unique
              optical and electronic properties for potential applications in devices. 
              

New polymeric materials based on carbon selenides and cadmium selenide
              quantum dots with electronic and photonic properties will be prepared.
              Synthetic methods to prepare poly (carbondiselenide)s free from elemental
              selenium and physical methods to characterize these materials would provide
              basic science knowledge for the future development of new electronic and
              photonic materials.  Doped thin and flexible films of carbon diselenides would
              have unique electronic and photonic properties for applications in devices. 
              The research, in addition, will provide training to graduate students in
              electronic and photonic materials.
