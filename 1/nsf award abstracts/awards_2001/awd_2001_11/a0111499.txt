Abstract    :
              This project will study a number of risk management problems in finance
              requiring efficient computation of optimal trading decisions that are designed
              to account for various "frictions" found in modern markets.  Some examples of
              common frictions investigated here are: uncertain volatility, influence of
              competition for resources, and trading restrictions. The results will be
              implemented as software that can be downloaded, tested and implemented by
              interested parties, which may range from large trading  institutions to
              individuals with pension funds.

The spectacular growth in the size of the
              derivatives market over the last twenty-five years (currently it has a turnover
              of trillions of dollars in the US), plus recent infamous (and equally
              spectacular) risk (mis)management disasters, such as the Barings, Orange County
              and Long Term Capital Management fiascos, have created an urgent need for smart
              mathematical and computational models to quantify the respective risks and
              rewards of such investments. This project aims to build on the methodology
              introduced by Black, Scholes and Merton, to take into account the fluctuating
              nature of market volatility and other frictions.  The main mathematical tools
              are in the realm of stochastic control and asymptotic analysis.
