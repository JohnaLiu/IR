Abstract    :
              This project provides for summer workshops for computer science faculty on the
              use of history in improving undergraduate computer science instruction. The
              workshops target computer science faculty who agree to incorporate units or
              modules dealing with history into their courses in the year after the workshop.
              First year workshop participants serve as mentors to the second year
              participants. Speakers at the workshops are individuals known nationally for
              efforts on behalf of computing history and instructional curricula and
              materials that include computing history. This project encourages the
              participants to develop and adapt exemplary materials for use in their classes
              and includes dissemination to the computer science community for possible use
              and adaptation by others.
