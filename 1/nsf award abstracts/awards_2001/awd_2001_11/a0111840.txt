International Meshing Roundtable (IMR) takes place every year
              in the United States.  IMR attracts researchers from universities, national
              laboratories, and computer vendors from the US, Canada, many countries from
              Europe, Japan, and some countries from South America.  IMR is an ideal forum to
              attract and excite young researchers in the field of mesh generation.  
              Graduate students selection for travel support will be based on two criteria:  
              ( i ) advanced students will present their own papers accepted by the IMR
              program committee  ( ii )  not so advanced students will be asked to submit one
              page statements of interest signed by their advisor and/or chairman of their
              department.
