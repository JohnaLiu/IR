Abstract    :
              Dr. Dong-Sheng Yang of the University of Kentucky is funded for his research on
              spectroscopic studies of weakly bound metal-molecule complexes by the Physical
              Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division.  Pulsed field ionization-zero
              electron kinetic energy (ZEKE) spectroscopy will be used to provide the
              electronic structure of metal (Al, Ga, in, Sc, Y, La) ligand (ammonia, amines,
              phosphines, arsines) 1-1 complexes.  These complexes will be prepared by pulsed
              laser vaporization and identified with photoionization mass spectroscopy.  The
              ionization energies and vibrational frequencies measured by ZEKE spectroscopy
              will be used, in combination with ab initio calculations, to elucidate the
              bonding and structure of these complexes.  The spectra and understanding
              obtained will be useful for detection and process development for semiconductor
              applications and for studies of the reaction mechanisms of these
              complexes.

It is important in the semiconductor industry to have sensitive
              spectroscopic methods for detecting ammonia, amine, phosphine, and arsine
              complexes of important metals such as aluminum, gallium, and indium. Dr. Yang's
              work will elucidate the electronic structure of these complexes.  Such results
              will provide critically needed data for the study of these species in
              industrial processes and will increase our understanding of how metals interact
              with such useful molecules in organometallic complexes, bioinorganic complexes,
              and at metal surfaces.
