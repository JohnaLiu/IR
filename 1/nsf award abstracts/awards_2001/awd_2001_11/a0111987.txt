Abstract    :
              Can some candidates benefit from being in contests with more than two
              candidates?  Traditional theories of political choice assume that increasing
              the number of candidates in an election campaign cannot influence voter
              preferences.  However, a growing body of literature on consumer behavior
              suggests that varying the menu of alternatives can influence choices in
              systematic ways.   This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support project tests
              whether these findings apply to collective choices and electoral politics.  The
              student hypotheses that the menu of available options can influence a voter's
              decision.  When there are more than two candidates in the race, a compromise
              effect benefits moderate candidates.  Consequently, when there are more than
              two candidates, race and party influence how voters evaluate candidates
              differently than when there are only two candidates divided by party label
              and/or by the candidate's race.  The student focuses on how perceptions of the
              alternatives and affect towards the candidates are affected by the set of
              alternatives.   The hypothesis is tested by collecting experimental data from
              subjects in different choice situations with a varying menu of
              alternatives.

This interesting and innovative project promises to enhance
              our understanding of the topic.
