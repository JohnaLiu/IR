Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Division will support Virginia Polytechnic Institute's proposed
              expansion of the use of their Mobile Chemistry Laboratory (MCL) that had
              received initial startup support from NSF and various other private, public,
              and corporate funding sources.  Specifically, their planned program will expand
              the use of their MCL into more rural regions of southwestern Virginia and will
              establish two additional weeks of teacher workshops.  In addition, a kit-based
              program will be developed for those schools that have adequate lab space but
              limited budgets and equipment.  They plan to continue to develop the curriculum
              they initiated this past year.  There will be increased efforts in the
              recruiting of teachers from underrepresented areas.
