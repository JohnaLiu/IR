This grant provides three-years partial salary support for an
              Phase I Ph.D. level technician to work for the Watershed Studies Program at
              Dartmouth College.  This program, a collaborative effort between PIs Carl
              Renshaw and Xiahong Feng, emphasizes an interdisciplinary approach to
              understanding the mechanisms of contaminant transport through watersheds.  The
              principal duties of the technician will be to work with the PIs to oversee and
              manage the technical requirements of the Watershed Studies analytical chemistry
              laboratories.  Specific duties include: the assembly and testing of new
              instruments for high resolution monitoring of fluid and contaminant transport
              in heterogeneous media, including snow, soils, and streambeds; assisting the
              PIs with a series of pilot studies of new methods and ideas related to
              understanding fluid and contaminant transport through heterogeneous media;
              assisting the PIs in related collaborations with researchers outside of
              Dartmouth; and to oversee the operation, maintenance, and student training for
              our analytical instruments including an ICP-OES, an IC, a TOC analyzer, and
              isotopic extraction lines.
