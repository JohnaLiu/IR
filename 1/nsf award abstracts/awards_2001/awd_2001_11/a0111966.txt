Abstract    :
              The AIM Research Conference Center (ARCC) will foster progress in
the
              mathematical sciences and contribute significantly to the
current and future
              productivity of mathematicians.  Through the
sponsorship of focused workshops,
              ARCC will provide a new venue
for research mathematics which will enhance and
              complement
existing conference centers and institutes.  ARCC
              focused
workshops will be distinguished by their emphasis on a
              specific
mathematical goal, such as a significant unsolved problem,
              an
important new result, or the explanation of the convergence
between two
              distinct areas of mathematics.  Also planned are
workshops exploring
              connections between mathematics and other
sciences.  A small team of
              researchers will carefully plan each
workshop so as to maximize its
              effectiveness in achieving this
goal.  Central to each workshop will be a
              public website which,
during the lead-in phase, will outline the scope of the
              workshop
and provide resources to the participants.  Most workshops will
last
              for one week and will feature a small selection of talks
coupled with several
              problem and discussion sessions.
Immediately following the workshop, the
              website will be expanded
to serve both as a record of the workshop and as a
              comprehensive
resource for the current status of important problems
              and
results.  The website will remain up-to-date through the
incorporation of
              future work and new developments.  The
collection of all workshop websites
              will grow to become a
comprehensive and interconnected resource for the most
              important
problems and results in modern mathematics.

In recent years,
              mathematics has become an increasingly
collaborative endeavor, and many of
              today's important unsolved
problems will require techniques from several areas
              of the
mathematical sciences.  The ARCC focused workshops will provide
an
              ideal forum for a team of researchers, working together, to
map out
              strategies, set priorities, work toward a solution, and
set in place a
              framework for progress on important problems.  It
is expected that these
              workshops will often lay the groundwork
for significant efforts, both by
              focused research groups and
through special, longer term programs at other
              institutes.  When
it is operating at full capacity, ARCC will sponsor 20-25
              focused
workshops per year, each designed to facilitate
              collaborative
progress on an important area of the mathematical sciences. 
              To
ensure that these collaborations will be successful, the leaders
in each
              field will be involved in the planning of the workshops.
Equally importantly,
              junior scientists and graduate students will
be actively involved in the
              workshops, thereby ensuring the
long-term development of the ensuing work and
              contributing to the
education of new mathematicians.  Special attention will
              be
devoted to facilitate collaborations which include women,
minorities, and
              researchers at primarily undergraduate
institutions.  This will allow for a
              more effective use of the
nation's collective mathematical knowledge and
              resources.  The
AIM Research Conference Center's emphasis on
              focused
collaborative research will foster significant progress on
important
              mathematical problems and will be of significant
benefit to both current and
              future generations of mathematicians.
