Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further
              develop and optimize the NZP (sodium zirconium phosphate type) ceramic-based
              thermal barrier coating (TBC) technology for use in advanced turbine and power
              generation systems. These advanced systems drive the need for higher operating
              temperatures to achieve better efficiencies without compromising durability.
              Such requirements heighten the threat of: (i) microstructural changes which
              reduce thermal barrier effectiveness; (ii) premature oxidative spalling;  and
              (iii) susceptibility to mechanical stresses in conventional yttria-stabilized
              zirconia (YSZ)-based TBCs. Some NZP ceramics have very low thermal and oxygen
              conductivity, excellent thermal cycling resistance and high temperature
              stability but also have low thermal expansion.  Phase I demonstrated the
              feasibility of thermal spraying simple and functionally graded (to minimize
              thermal expansion mismatches) TBCs of NZP with YSZ that are better thermal
              barriers and also have very good thermal cycling resistance to 1200 degrees C.
              The primary goal for Phase II is to complete the scientific and engineering
              development in order to commercialize the NZP-based TBC technology.  A team of
              academic and industrial collaborators will work under the guidance of committed
              end-users to achieve this goal. 

Potential successful development of the
              NZP-based TBC concept will enable applications in high efficiency power
              generating systems and gas turbine engines; specifically, for turbine vanes and
              blades, and combustors and afterburners. Coatings based on NZP can also double
              up as environmental barrier coatings (EBCs), and find use in diesel engines and
              as abradable seals. The financial benefits of the NZP-based coatings could be
              over $100M arising from reduced component maintenance and fuel and operational
              costs.
