Abstract    :
              The research project submitted by Dr. Peter Williams and Dr. Richard Hervig of
              Arizona State University entitled "Analytical, Fundamental and Instrumental
              Developments in Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS)" is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  The goals for the project are 1) to
              develop methods for real-time, quantitative analysis on the influence of oxygen
              on sputtered ion yields.  2) Fundamental studies in sputtered neutral analysis.
              This will include establishing mechanism of ionization and studying
              contamination problems.  3) To explore massive cluster ion source experiments
              for gathering information on sputtering yields and behavior.    The
              quantitative, real-time measurements are innovative and well thought out.   The
              massive cluster impact source experiments are challenging, and of great
              interest for the depth profiling of semiconductors and biological
              surfaces.

There are potential societal impacts from this research because
              the quantitative calculation of impurity content and distribution at shallow
              depths could significantly improve microelectronics manufacture.  The
              fundamental  research is important to the field of surface mass spectrometric
              analysis.
