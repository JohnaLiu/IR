Abstract    :
              This project contributes to Western Arctic Shelf-Basin Interactions (SBI) by
              focussing on a) biogeochemical modifications of Pacific water over the Beaufort
              and Chukchi shelf and slope regions,
with emphasis on carbon and nitrogen; and
              b) comparative analysis of the findings over the broad Chukchi shelf and narrow
              Beaufort shelf and adjacent slopes to facilitate integration of the Western
              Arctic into a Pan-Arctic perspective. The project will evaluate the processes
              of carbon and nitrogen transport, exchanges and transformations in the regions
              of interest.  Specific objectives are: a) determination of mass transport and
              fate of carbon and nitrogen associated with the volume transports calculated by
              SBI collaborators; b) interpretation of carbon and nitrogen spatial
              distributions and temporal variability relative to biological
and physical
              conditions; c) evaluation of partitioning of organic matter between dissolved
              and particulate phases; d) determination of net community production and it's
              fate; e) determination of C:N stoichiometry as a complement to biological
              studies, particularly in relation to community structure and seasonal
              progression of intense phytoplankton blooms in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas;
              and f) evaluation of the contribution of dissolved and particulate organic
              material to apparent oxygen utilization development in the Arctic halocline and
              export from the shelf.
