Abstract    :
              0124415  Saitou  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a general
              method for designing products with embedded disassembly processes that can be
              invoked by "pressing a disassembly button".  This will be achieved by
              developing a new class of reversible integral attachments (RIAs) that can be
              detached by the application of localized heat.  Design methodologies will be
              developed that will facilitate: (1) the identification of the components to be
              recovered, and (2) the embedding of RIAs into the product to facilitate the
              most efficient access to the components of interest upon product disassembly. 
              Specific research tasks include: (1) extension of existing approaches toward
              determining recovery targets to include environmental validation metrics with
              the intent of considering both environmental and financial factors during
              design for disassembly, (2) development of a design method for a new class of
              RIAs that can be detached by application of localized heat, based on the
              structural topology optimization algorithm, and (3) development of a systematic
              procedure to generate the design specifications (attachment location,
              engagement type, removal direction, heating spot location) for RIAs using
              computer aided design technology in order to realize the most efficient access
              to components, based on the overall product geometry and the desired
              disassembly sequence.  ***
