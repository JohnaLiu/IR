This U.S.-Brazil Program award will provide support for
              cooperative research between Dr. Jose Barros-Neto of Rutgers University and Dr.
              Fernando Cardoso at the Universidade Federal do Recife in Brazil.  The
              researchers intend to study fundamental solutions to a class of partial
              differential equations that have been the subject of extensive studies and
              generalizations for their usefulness as a mathematical model in gas dynamics
              and flows.

More specifically, this project involves the study of fundamental
              solutions of the Tricomi equation, which is the classical prototype of a
              partial differential operator of mixed type, and its generalizations at certain
              spatial points.  Building on the important role that certain hypergeometric
              functions play in the finding of fundamental solutions to the Tricomi operator,
              the researchers aim to develop new analytic facts about differential operators
              of mixed type and push forward standard Euclidean analysis to higher
              dimensional manifolds with more complicated symmetry structure.
