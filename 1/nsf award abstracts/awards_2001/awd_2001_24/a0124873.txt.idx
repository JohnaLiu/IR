Abstract    :
              Abstract  The information revolution has led organizations worldwide to rely
              heavily on numerous databases to conduct their daily business. Because
              databases usually exist in broad, highly dynamic network-based environments,
              formally accessing the resources in a secure manner poses a difficult
              challenge. Specially, the healthcare industry has recently tried to transit
              from their old and disparate business models based on ink and paper to a new
              and consolidated ones based on digitalized information since last a few years
              for their customers' and stakeholders' needs.  In addition, the proposed rules
              of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), circulated
              by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) through the Health
              Care Financial Administration (HCFA) strongly require the services of security
              and privacy. Along with this movement, a secure solution for the complex
              environment like healthcare industry has been highly demanded. Recently, the
              President's Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC) has issued a
              report about how security can be deployed to modernize the nation's healthcare
              systems. Nobody has taken a leadership role and demanded investment in
              information technology. Without active leadership it will be difficult, if not
              possible, to get the highly decentralized healthcare industry to come up with a
              standard secure information system. This motivates us to propose a scalable
              application that can serve as a security tool to the complex environment like
              healthcare industry. The problem we seek to address in this research is to
              provide authentication of individual identity in the context of accessing
              critical information including secure transmission of data across the Internet.
              These problems have technical solutions that are well known, but the solutions
              in general are strongly biased toward a single individual interacting with a
              single application. When an individual needs to access more than one
              application, or even the same application at a different location or
              institution, he or she needs another set of electronic keys. In a collaborative
              and research environment, individuals must collect and maintain a key set of
              electronic access mechanisms that quickly becomes cumbersome and difficult to
              manage. For this reason, we focus on token-based solution. In this research,
              we propose scalable token-based authentication architectures & mechanisms and
              demonstrate how we can implement them using commercial-off-the-self
              technologies. Our approach focuses on vendor-neutral specifications including
              the feasibility of the construction of password, certificate and
              signature-based authentication mechanisms.
