Abstract    :
               The limits to temporal resolution imposed by processes of time-averaging (i.e.,
              age mixing of fossils that determines the temporal resolution of the fossil
              record) have broad implications for interpretation of the fossil record in a
              wide variety of types of studies.  Almost no information on time-averaging is
              currently available for brachiopods, the predominant organism comprising
              Paleozoic and many later marine shell assemblages.  We propose to use a
              combination of amino acid racemization and radiocarbon dating to document
              time-averaging in surficial accumulations of mixed brachiopod-mollusk shells on
              the southern Brazilian shelf.  The resulting data will provide quantitative
              estimates of age structures of dated shells of brachiopods and mollusks from
              seven sites along a depth gradient. The study is expected to produce (1) the
              first quantitative estimates of time-averaging for brachiopod shell
              accumulations, (2) the first comparative data on time-averaging for two groups
              of biomineralized organisms (brachiopods vs. mollusks), and (3) the first
              estimates of time-averaging along an onshore-offshore bathymetric gradient. By
              adding taxonomic and environmental dimensions to the current knowledge of
              time-averaging, this study will provide a significant contribution to our
              understanding of the temporal resolution of the fossil record.
