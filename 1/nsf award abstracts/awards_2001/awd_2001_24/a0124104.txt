Abstract    :
              The Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship program provides an
              opportunity for current elementary and secondary mathematics, science, and
              technology classroom teachers with demonstrated excellence in teaching to serve
              in federal agencies that impact science and mathematics education. All Einstein
              Fellowship candidates have been recognized for excellence through the
              Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics or Science Teaching or a
              similar meritorious award. Einstein Fellows bring to Congress and selected
              federal agencies the insights, extensive knowledge and practical experience of
              teachers working in science and mathematics classrooms. This project supports
              one Einstein Fellow assigned to NSF's Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE)
              for an 11-month period. The Fellow serves as a valuable resource by working
              with DUE Program Officers on programs focusing on effective mathematics and
              science classroom teaching, preservice teacher preparation, projects that link
              teacher preservice and inservice activities, and national teacher education
              issues.
