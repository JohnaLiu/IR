Abstract    :
              
The proposal uniquely plans to connect IIT to Argonne National Laboratory and
              then vBNS and Abilene, as part of an I-wire initiative.  This network will
              enhance fluid dynamics research by making instrumentation in the IIT Fluid
              Dynamics Center available to other researchers via the national network;
              biological simulation research which are too large to run on the local IIT
              computer cluster; and research on improved methods of data-transfer among
              computational grids.
