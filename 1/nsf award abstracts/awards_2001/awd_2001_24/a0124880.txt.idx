Abstract    :
              The proposal plans to connect CSU to OARNet and then to the Abilene Network to
              support research requiring a high performance connection in the following
              areas: Computational chemistry (supercomputer requirements) Enzyme research
              (supercomputer requirements) Health Sciences and Curriculum & Foundations
              Departments(distance education)
