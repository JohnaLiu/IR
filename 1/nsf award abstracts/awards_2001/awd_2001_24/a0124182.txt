Abstract    :
              This award will provide funds to partially support 10 junior researchers and 5
              invited speakers to participate in an international research workshop on
              "Developments and Challenges in bump hunting, mixtures and measurement error
              models" to be held in Cleveland, June 2-4, 2002.  The workshop has multiple
              purposes.  It brings together statisticians and a collection of scientists from
              different fields, yet all working towards similar scientific goals, to exchange
              new techniques and explore merging ideas.  The workshop provides a unique
              opportunity for young statisticians to interact with leaders in these related
              fields.  It invites experts with a national reputation from astronomy, biology
              and medicine, to discuss challenges to statistics, particularly in bump
              hunting, mixture modeling, clustering and measurement error models.
