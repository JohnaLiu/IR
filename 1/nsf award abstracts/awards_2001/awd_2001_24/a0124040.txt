Abstract    :
              This award will provide support for graduate students and junior
investigators
              to attend the International Nuclear Physics Conference
in Berkeley,
              California.  The conference will cover all aspects of
nuclear physics
              research, with special emphasis on new directions,
new opportunities, and the
              impact of nuclear science on society. 
Held every three years, this marks the
              first time that the
conference venue has been in the United States since
              1980.
