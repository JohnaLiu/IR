Abstract    :
              0124761  Stuart  The goal of the proposed research is to develop a modeling
              framework and rapid materials identification methodologies to significantly
              improve resource utilization in the thermoplastics supply cycle.  The specific
              goals are to: (1) design and develop an instrumental methodology for the
              off-line and in-process composition monitoring of pure and mixed polymer feed
              stocks (resin pellets/regrind, and (2) design and develop a computational model
              that links composition information derived from material analysis in the supply
              chain with knowledge of molder demand to decide new criteria for selecting
              blending compositions and inventory quantities in the plastics supply cycle. 
              The ultimate objective is to provide viable means to overcome significant
              barriers to the development of a sustainable supply cycle for plastics
              manufacturing.
