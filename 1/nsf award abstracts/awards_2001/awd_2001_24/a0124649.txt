Abstract    :
              Since its inception as a formal program, one of the unique characteristics of
              the I/UCRC Program has been its commitment to a systematic and objective
              evaluation effort.  As it has evolved over the years, the evaluation effort
              relies heavily on standardized collection of data by independent on-site
              evaluators at every IUCRC Center.

An evaluation system built upon a national
              network of local evaluators requires a considerable amount of support and
              coordination.  Although the support and coordination provided by NSF staff and
              the "evaluators coordinating committee" are essential to the program's success,
              these mechanisms are not adequate to meet the needs of an evaluation project
              that has grown to be national in scope.

Funding is also being provided for a
              one-year project, "Quantifying Industry IUCRC Benefits"  The project will
              attempt to develop quantitative measures of some of the benefits firms might
              receive via their participation in IUCRCs.
