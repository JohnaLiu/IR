Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of highly reactive catalysts for
              synthetically useful reactions such as the Heck, Suzuki and Buchwald-Hartwig
              couplings. To this end, water-soluble alkylphosphines will be synthesized and
              used in conjunction with aqueous-phase palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions. 
              These reactions efficiently provide structures of interest in areas ranging
              from pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals to electronic materials and
              commodity chemicals.

With this new NSF/EPA Technology for a Sustainable
              Environment (TSE) award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and
              the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate of Mathematics
              and Physical Sciences are supporting the research efforts of Dr. Kevin H.
              Shaughnessy of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Alabama,
              Tuscaloosa.  Professor Shaughnessy will focus his research on developing
              methodology for the use of a new class of sterically demanding, water-soluble
              alkylphosphines in palladium-catalyzed C-C and C-heteroatom bond forming
              reactions using environmentally benign aqueous solvent. Adoption of this
              methodology by industry could result in the decrease of hazardous waste
              generation, decrease in energy consumption and decrease in the use of volatile
              organic solvents.  The undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students
              working on this project will gain a fundamental education in organic and
              organometallic chemistry and approaches to developing environmentally benign
              chemical reactions.
