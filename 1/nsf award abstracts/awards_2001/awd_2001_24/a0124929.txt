Abstract    :
              The proposal plans to connect HWI to vBNS and Abilene via the University at
              Buffalo. Scientists at HWI are engaged in protein research and will use this
              connection for real-time access and control of diffraction experiments
              conducted at synchrotron sites around the country in order to conduct protein
              analyses, for data-mining and data-warehousing.
