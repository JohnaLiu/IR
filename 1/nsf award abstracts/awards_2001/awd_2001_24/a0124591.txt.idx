Abstract    :
              The Biochemical Engineering Conference serves as the premier meeting for the
              Biochemical Engineering community. The focus of this Conference will include
              important core areas of Biochemical Engineering (fermentation/cell culture and
              downstream process development) as well as exciting new frontiers of
              Biochemical Engineering (nanotechnologies, the "omics" of proteomics, genomics
              and physiomics, marine and environmental biotechnology). The Conference will
              illustrate how the same engineering fundamentals (unit operations, mass and
              energy transport, thermodynamics, and kinetics) that form the basis of
              traditional areas of Biochemical Engineering are being applied to drive
              advances in both areas. In addition to the regular sessions, two workshops are
              planned. A workshop entitled "Biochemical Engineering Education: fundamentals
              versus state-of-the-art" will focus on the often-competing needs to incorporate
              engineering fundamental into the curriculum as well as state-of-the-art
              applications. This workshop will feature representatives from industry and
              academe. A second workshop entitled "New Directions in Biochemical Engineering
              Research" will focus on potentially new areas for research in Biochemical
              Engineering. The discussion will have as panelists both academic and industrial
              representatives. Each panelist will be asked to prepare a single transparency
              and speak for no longer than 5 minutes. Following the presentations, input from
              the audience will be requested.
