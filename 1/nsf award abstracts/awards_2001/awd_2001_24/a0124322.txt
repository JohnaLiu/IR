Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research project has as its primary
              objective the investigation of the feasibility of a novel 360-degree display
              monitor concept for video conferencing.  Videoconferencing technology has long
              sought to facilitate more natural and effective one-on-one and group
              communications and collaboration among people separated by distance.  The plan
              is to build a 360-degree monitor to show panoramic video images from the center
              of the table to all 360-degree viewing angles.  All participants can see the
              displayed image from where he/she is seated.  At the same time, all
              participants in the conference room can see each other directly, while
              communicating with people from the other site via the 360-degree display
              monitor and a 360-degree camera.  
     Genex Technologies' proffered
              technology will be of interest for a broad range to a broad range of consumers.
               Its applications include videoconferencing, security, and the entertainment
              industry.
