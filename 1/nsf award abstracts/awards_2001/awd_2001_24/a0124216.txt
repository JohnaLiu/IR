This award supports a three-year collaborative research
              project in mathematics between Dr. Astrid an Huef of the University of Denver,
              Dr. Dana Williams of Dartmouth University, and Dr. Iain Raeburn of the
              University of Newcastle in Australia.  This project will focus on three goals:
              1) to prove a symmetric imprimitivity theorem for commuting proper actions on a
              non-commutative C-algebra, 2) to show that this new symmetric imprimitivity
              theorem applies in a wide variety of examples, and 3) to extend related results
              known for reduced crossed products to full crossed products.  The proposed
              research is central in operator algebra theory and has applications to
              representation theory.
 
The project brings together the efforts of three
              laboratories (two in the United States and one in Australia) that have
              complementary expertise and research capabilities.  An Huef is well versed in
              the modern theory of integrable and proper actions, Williams has expertise in
              vector-valued integration and harmonic analysis, and Raeburn is an expert on
              nonabelian duality.  This project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and
              promote international understanding and cooperation.
