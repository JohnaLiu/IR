Abstract    :
              The proposal plans to connect Gallaudet to MAX and then to the Abilene Network
              to enhance research into quality of service at a national level with
              experiments focused on improving the delivery of sign language and captioned
              video over the Internet. The proposed connectivity will more closely connect
              researchers at Gallaudet University to their current collaborators at other
              universities and will enable Gallaudet researchers to expand their efforts to
              move the applications they are developing beyond the edge of their campus.  
              Although the research described in the proposal is not standard or traditional,
              it may contribute significantly to improving applications which will improve
              accessibility to the Internet.
