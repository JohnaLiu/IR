Abstract    :
              This starter-grant is for 2:1 matching (institutional:NSF) for start up
              equipment costs for a researcher who has completed two years of an NSF
              post-doctoral fellowship and now has a tenure-track position at San Francisco
              State University. The equipment costs support an analysis of how social
              fragmentation, characterized by racial, class, and economic inequality, are
              related to spatial inequalities in pollution exposures and associated health
              risks. The research will address the question of how racial and economic
              segregation relate to disparities in exposures to environmental hazards and
              associated health impacts among diverse communities and whether communities
              characterized by high levels of segregation and socioeconomic inequality
              experience higher levels of environmental health risks overall. These questions
              will be examined at both the regional and state levels, using the Los Angeles
              Air Basin and California as a geographic area of analysis. Study results from
              this research in California will have implications for the development of
              public health interventions and policy initiatives for community and economic
              development.Indices of social and racial stratification (such as race, class,
              and income segregation, rapid demographic change and indicators of economic
              inequality, such as the Gini coefficient) for regions and counties in
              California will be derived using variables from the 1990 and 2000 US Census.
              Using conventional environmental health risk assessment methods, air toxics
              exposures and health risks indicators will be calculated by combining modeled
              air toxics concentration estimates with cancer and non-cancer toxicity
              information. Multivariate regression analysis will be used to assess the
              relationship between environmental health risks (dependent variables) and
              social stratification indicators (independent variables) while controlling for
              important covariates such as population density, land use, political power and
              civic participation. Furthermore, a theoretical framework will be developed for
              understanding how inequality diminishes social capital and social cohesion
              which in turn can increase community vulnerability to the placement of
              environmental hazards and exposures to pollution.
