Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to functionalize water-soluble enzymes to
              provide hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts, which are expected to self-assemble
              and catalyze reactions at organic-aqueous interfaces.  Current methodologies
              with enzymes placed in either aqueous or organic solutions suffer significant
              solubility and mass transfer limitations for reacting systems.  The proposed
              interfacial configuration provides reagents in the biphasic systems the maximum
              access to the biocatalyst so that solubility and mass transfer limitations can
              be reduced.  The polymeric modifying groups will alter the microenvironmental
              interactions around the enzyme moieties and reduce the interfacial tension, and
              thus affect the interfacial assembly and activation of enzymes.  Fundamentals
              related to the interfacial assembly and reaction kinetics, particularly the
              effect of interfacial tension, will be explored both experimentally and
              theoretically.  The feasibility of this interfacial biocatalysis will be
              examined and demonstrated for the enzymatic production of epoxides and
              glycosides.  These enzymatic syntheses may lead to more
              environmentally-friendly routes for large-scale production of valuable
              chemicals.
