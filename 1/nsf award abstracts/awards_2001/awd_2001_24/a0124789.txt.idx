Abstract    :
              This NSF/EPA Technology for a Sustainable Environment project seeks to address
              fundamental issues associated with replacing existing petroleum-based glass
              fiber - polypropylene composites with eco-friendly, sustainable, bio-composites
              from renewable resource-based natural/bio-fibers and bio-plastics for
              automotive applications. The research will focus on:  (1) innovative bio-fiber
              surface treatments and the design of engineered natural fibers; (2) synthesis
              of cellosic bio-plastics with acceptable mechanical properties; and (3)
              research into the processing methods to produce void free bio-composites sheets
              for stamping processes. The use of an electrical field during the processing
              enhances control of fiber alignment.  It is expected that this will result in
              a break-through process for the new generation of bio-composites that is cost
              effective as well as environmentally friendly. University - industry
              collaboration is expected to add knowledge of the material and process
              engineering as well as to create a consciousness in designing value-added
              composite materials from bio-resources for the automotive and transporation
              industries. Knowledge gained from this research will enhance the education of
              students and practitioners in engineering design as well as manufacturing and
              production engineers concerned with environmentally benign manufacturing.
