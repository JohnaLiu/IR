Abstract    :
              This project will analyze ice nucleating particles in real-time for chemical
              composition using single-particle mass spectrometry. A continuous flow ice
              thermal gradient diffusion chamber (CFDC) will be coupled to the NOAA PALMS
              (Particle Analysis by Laser Mass Spectrometry) instrument and deployed in the
              field. This research will provide an assessment of the role of various aerosol
              types as ice nuclei for cirrus cloud formation, and the role of certain
              constituents as promoters or inhibitors of ice formation. The results of this
              project are likely to have broad societal impacts by providing new insights
              into the mechanisms for cloud formation, a topic critical for better
              understanding climate change.
