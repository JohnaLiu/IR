Weller
This award supports Henry Weller and students from Duke in a
              collaboration with Hans Arends of the Institute for Nuclear Physics at the
              University of Mainz, Germany.  The project will focus on measuring the validity
              of the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule for the deuteron.  The low-energy part or
              the measurement will be performed in the US, with participation by the German
              group, and the high-energy part of the measurement will be performed on the
              Mainz Microtron in Germany.  The measurements will compare the sum rules on the
              neutron and proton to that on the deuteron, for which both high- and low-energy
              measurements are required.  A possible continuation of the collaboration could
              then work on measuring the sum rule for Helium-3.  The work plan provides for
              extensive participation by graduate students in the international travel and
              research.
