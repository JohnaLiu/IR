Abstract    :
              The PI received a postdoctoral fellowship in 1998 (DBI 9804178) to explore how
              changing climate might affect the long-term demographic strategies of plants
              and red deer in Norway.   Dr. Post collaborated with Dr. Stenseth in Norway on
              quantitative aspects of the project.  The PI in now in a tenure track position
              at The Pennsylvania State University.  He proposes to use highly resolved field
              data at multiple spatial and temporal scales to resolve the interactions
              between climate and trophic structure (predators, herbivores, and plants) using
              cutting-edge individual-based models.  This project will advance ecological
              understanding in that hypothesis-driven and process-oriented perspectives will
              replace current approaches involving retrospective time-series analyses.  The
              integration of well designed field studies of wolves, moose, and vegetation in
              the environs of Denali Park in Alaska, and advanced quantitative modeling will
              facilitate development of a unifying theory regarding the effects of climate
              change on community stability.
