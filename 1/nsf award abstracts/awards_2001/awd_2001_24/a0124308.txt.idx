Abstract    :
              CTS-012430 de Pablo, Juan J U of Wisconsin - Madison  Abstract  It is
              proposed to organize a series of lectures at universities and research
              institutions whose goal will be to disseminate recent advances in the area of
              molecular thermodynamics and complex-fluid behavior, and to foster
              collaborations and exchanges between the U.S. and Mexico.  The speakers will be
              selected in order to represent a broad overview of current research activities
              and new directions being pursued at U.S. institutions.  While in Mexico, the
              speakers will be hosted by scientists and engineers from the National
              Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the Metropolitan University (UAM), the
              Polytechnic Institute (IPN), and the Mexican Petroleum Institute (IMP).  The
              net result of this project will be an increased level of interaction and
              collaboration between U.S. scientists and engineers, their Mexican
              counterparts, and Mexican students.
