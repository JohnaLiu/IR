Abstract    :
              This award is made under the NSF/EPA Partnership for Environmental Research TSE
              2001.  The research objective of this effort is to demonstrate the technical
              feasibility of mass replication of high-aspect-ratio metallic miroparts by
              fabricating aluminum cross-flow heat exchanges.  Currently a major technical
              barrier to mass replication of aluminum parts by high temperature micromolding
              is the undesirable interaction between the hot/molten aluminum and micromold. 
              This leads to soldering and consequently the inability to separate the mold
              from the molded aluminum part.  The approach to be taken is to uniformly coat
              highly nonplanar micromolds in a manner that it makes it possible to eject the
              aluminum part from the miromold after molding operation.  This will be achieved
              by using plasma-assisted, vapor-phase deposition technology to deposit
              conformal coatings with uniform chemical and mechanical properties onto the
              surfaces of high-aspect-ratio micromolds.  Mircomolds are fabricated using the
              deep X-ray lithography/electrodeposition based microfabrication technique at
              the Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices at Louisiana State
              University.

If successful, this research will allow modification of the
              near-surface properties of the micromold to enable easy and repeated mold/part
              separation, hence removing a major existing technical barrier in mass
              replication of aluminum parts by high temperature micromolding.  This will lead
              to increased end-use energy savings and efficiencies associated with the
              creation of compact heat exchangers.
