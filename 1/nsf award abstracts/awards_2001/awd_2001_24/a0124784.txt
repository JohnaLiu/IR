It is proposed to
              build nanostructures by controlled self-assembly: they would be made of unit
              protein rods (approximately 50nm long rods) which would be organized in the
              shape of equilateral triangles, the sides of which would be made of
              complimentary binding pairs.  Assembly of these triangles will be carried out
              by stages in a third dimension, with the desired order and growth.  In this
              manner, the "bottom up" parallel manufacture of nanoarrays will become a
              practical possibility.  A sequential assembly of three binding pairs is used. 
              There are three major challenges: addressing the relevant binding pairs;
              positioning them in proper spacing and identifying the staging procedure for
              each new desired nanostructure.  The complexity of these tasks, for any truly
              desirable assembly of nanostructures, demands a large number of steps (design
              and produce modular unit rods, associate one of the rods to a matrix and
              assemble the unit rods in a programmatic generation of triangles).
