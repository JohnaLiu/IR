Abstract    :
              The proposal plans to connect SLU to the Abilene Network to enable research in
              the areas of 
 meteorological research in conjunction with the University
              Corporation for Atmospheric Research, 
 radar data analysis in conjunction
              with the Center for the Analysis and Prediction of Storms in Oklahoma and the
              National Weather Service, 
 neuroscience where surgery is guided via
              real-time, remote supercomputing to analyze tissue images, and in silico
              experiments in genomic sequence.
