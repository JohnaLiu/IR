     The investigator and his colleagues organize a
              conference on
theoretical immunology.  The field of theoretical immunology
              has
become a prominent direction in biomathematics and it
              concerns
mathematical modeling of the biocomplexity in the immune system,
and
              more specifically the generation of immune responses to
infections, generation
              and maintenance of immune memory,
understanding the mechanisms that govern
              persistent infections,
designing optimal strategies for antibiotic treatment
              of
infectious diseases, and vaccine development.  The main goals of
this
              conference are to advance the interaction between
theoretical and experimental
              directions of immunological research
and to facilitate a better communication
              between science and
medicine.  The conference focuses on modern approaches
              to
mathematical modeling of immune processes using differential
equations and
              dynamical systems, game theory, mathematical
statistics, stochastic processes
              and computer simulations, as
well as mathematical algorithms for data mining
              and data fitting.
The conference features lectures by prominent scientists
              on
fundamental results in the field as well as reports on work in
progress. 
              A special session is devoted to the discussion of new
directions and most
              significant problems of theoretical
immunology in the near future.
     The
              immune system is our primary defense against viruses and
infections. 
              Theoretical immunology is a relatively young field of
science that deals with
              theoretical modeling of interactions
between immune system and invading
              parasites.  Mathematical and
computer models are used to unify our
              understanding of the
extremely complex functioning of the immune system. 
              Such
theoretical models allow scientists to sort through the growing
wealth
              of experimental and clinical data and extract
fundamentally important features
              of immunity, design new
experiments, and optimize the performance of drugs and
              vaccines.
The meeting aims to bridge the gap between theoretical
              and
experimental biology and medicine and advance the theory of
immune
              processes to address the current needs of medicine and
biotechnology.  The
              conference has an educational impact by
exposing younger researchers and
              graduate students to the present
challenges in immunology and facilitating
              their future scientific
careers.
