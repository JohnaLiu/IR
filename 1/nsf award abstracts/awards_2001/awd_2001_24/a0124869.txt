Abstract    :
              Approximately 20% of the relative motion between the North American and Pacific
              plates is accommodated along a system of active right-lateral strike-slip
              faults which runs from southern California through western Nevada and into
              southern Oregon. This zone is known as the Eastern California Shear Zone and
              Walker Lane. The remaining 80% of relative offset occurs along the San Andreas
              fault. The northern portion of the Walker Lane, near Reno, Nevada, is
              especially poorly studied but is believed to be the youngest portion of the
              zone and, thus, may well be the best region within which to study the beginning
              stages of an intra-continental transform. This study will attempt to determine
              primarily the timing and amount of right-lateral offset across the fault zone
              by applying a variety of geologic and geochronologic techniques. The results
              will have significance for understanding the evolution of plate boundaries but
              will also be of considerable significance in evaluating the seismic risk for
              the Reno area.
