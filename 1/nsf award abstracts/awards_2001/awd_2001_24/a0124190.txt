Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the issue of integrated versus segregated primary and
              secondary schools and their effects on academic achievement.   The first
              objective of the study is to thoroughly document previous studies modeling
              academic achievement as a function of the school's racial composition. 
              Preliminary investigation suggests that while there has been substantial
              research on academic achievement of the general population and on the white
              male population, little has focused on determinants of academic achievement of
              black students, and on the effects of racial composition on academic
              achievement.

The second objective of this study is to use data from the
              National Survey of Black Americans (NSBA) to empirically investigate the issue
              of the impact of school and neighborhood racial composition on educational
              achievement.  This allows an indirect test of the effectiveness of actions
              stemming from the Brown v. Board of Education decision to integrate schools.   
              The NSBA data, however, lack one critical variable - school quality. 
              Therefore, the third and final objective of this study is to determine a
              feasible method of collecting these data, to improve estimates of the impact of
              racial composition
