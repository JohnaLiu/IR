               Abstract  The broad objective of this project is to develop an efficient
              electrochemical pumping process for separating an acid gas from emission
              sources and concentrating it for recovery and/or disposal.  The electrochemical
              pumping approach is being applied to the specific problem of removing and
              recovering CO2 from dilute gas streams.  The research activities include the
              identification and synthesis of appropriate molecular carriers for CO2.  Three
              different types of molecular-based carriers for CO2, which differ in their
              advantages and disadvantages, are being evaluated.  In one approach, a
              redox-active quinone is reduced to produce a base of sufficient strength to
              bind CO2 directly in absorption from the waste-stream source.  After CO2 is
              captured in this manner, the quinone-CO2 complex is oxidized electrochemically
              to release concentrated CO2 and to regenerate the oxidized form of the carrier.
               A second approach develops redox-active metal complexes that function in a
              similar cycle with bicarbonate ion.  These have the advantage of being
              air-stable and water-soluble.  A third approach investigates quinone carriers
              that produce an electrochemically controlled pH swing.  CO2 is complexed at
              high pH by hydroxide ions generated by quinone reduction and released at low pH
              produced by quinone oxidation. Work on each carrier system includes
              electrochemical studies of the reaction-absorption rates and binding constants
              of CO2 as functions of carrier oxidation state and studies of the
              electrochemical-pumping systems to determine appropriate operating parameters,
              characteristics of reproducibility and stability, and energy efficiencies.  In
              addition, process-modeling studies and investigations of absorption/desorption
              and related mass transport phenomena are being carried out.     Current CO2
              concentrations in the atmosphere have increased significantly from
              pre-industrial levels, and as the use of fossil fuels continues, CO2 levels
              will continue to rise.  In this scenario, climate models predict a significant
              global warming with serious environmental impacts.  Efficient methods must be
              developed in which CO2 is captured and stored for future use or sequestered in
              a stable form.   The easiest point to capture CO2 is from the waste streams of
              large producers such as power plants, chemical plants, etc. before the CO2 is
              diluted by mixing with the atmosphere.  It is estimated, however, that with
              today's best technology the recovery of CO2 from the exhaust of power plants
              will result in a 20-30% reduction in their overall efficiency.  Estimates based
              on prior research and modeling studies suggest  that an electrochemical pumping
              process with appropriate molecular carriers can be much more efficient than
              current conventional approaches for CO2 recovery.  As appropriate carriers are
              developed, this process should find application in the efficient removal of CO2
              as well as other acid gases from waste streams of industrial plants.
