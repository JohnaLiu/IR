Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              prototype of an integrated set of software tools for computer aided optimal
              design.  This tool box will require interfacing with large scale proprietary
              codes for the simulation of physical phenomena.  The industry problems to which
              will be addressed are such that conventional optimization techniques are not
              applicable. Intelligent search methods and parallel computing in distributed
              networks will be the basic tools to be considered. and the applicability of a
              recently developed system for asynchronous parallel pattern search. 

The 
              system, that exist today, needs to be extended so that nonlinear constraints
              can be introduced and larger dimensional problems can be solved. Initial focus
              will be on optimal structural design, piezoelectric transducer design and the
              design of optoelectronic devices.
