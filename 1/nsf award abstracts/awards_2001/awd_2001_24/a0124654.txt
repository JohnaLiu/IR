This Americas Program SGER (Small Grants for Exploratory
              Research) award will allow Dr. Louie Marincovich and a group of U.S. and
              Canadian researchers to undertake a three-week trip in July 2001, near Bay
              Fiord in west-central Ellesmere Island, as a pilot study that will, for the
              first time, coordinate the efforts of several specialists to decipher the
              paleobiogeographic and paleoclimatic importance of the unique biota of this
              area. The award will be jointly supported between the Division of International
              Programs and the Geology and Paleontology Program of NSF.

Rocks of the
              Eureka Sound Group on Ellesmere Island, northern Canada (78-79 degree N
              latitude), record an unusual time, 50-60 million years ago, when the high
              Arctic was home to alligators, giant tortoises, diverse mammals, (including
              primates and rhinoceroses), woodlands and vast lowland swamps. Mollusks thrived
              on land and in the adjacent warm ocean.  Although little-known overall, these
              diverse and abundant fossils are the only well-preserved record of the Earth's
              early Cenozoic arctic climate, and comprise the northernmost known marine and
              terrestrial biota of this age  These animals and plants lived in an extinct
              environment, combining a warm-temperate climate with an arctic light regime of
              bright summers and dark winters. The presence of this diverse and abundant
              early Cenozoic marine and terrestrial biota at such high latitudes comprises
              what may be the most profound paleontological mystery in the Arctic.  Studying
              the fossil vertebrates, plants and mollusks will increase our understanding of
              this rich biota, refine its age, provide insights into long-severed
              European-North American land connections, and decipher the polar expression of
              the warmest global climate of the past 65 million years.
