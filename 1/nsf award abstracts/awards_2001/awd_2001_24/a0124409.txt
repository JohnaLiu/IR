Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)
This project is developing a curriculum framework for
              undergraduate and graduate programs in Information Assurance. The framework
              includes: identification of broad areas of knowledge considered important for
              practicing professionals in information assurance, identification of key
              learning objectives for each of these areas, identification of a body of core
              knowledge and skills that all programs should contain, and a model curriculum
              including scope and sequence.

The framework's development is undertaken via
              a workshop of leading information assurance educators leading to a draft
              document which will then be widely distributed for comment and dissemination.
