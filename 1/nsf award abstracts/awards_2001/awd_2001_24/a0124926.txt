Abstract    :
              This is a seismological study of shear-wave splitting in the source volume of
              the large Mw 7.6 Chi-Chi, Taiwan, earthquake of 1999.  The study also
              investigates the guided fault zone waves, and non-linear wave propagation
              effects in damaged fault zone rock, using one of the best data sets in the
              world in a region of high natural seismicity.  A comprehensive measurement is
              carried out on the stress-induced crustal anisotropy, augmented by other
              possible signatures of damaged fault zone material, and the project also
              evaluates the relationship of observations with (therefore predictive potential
              of) the occurrence of great earthquakes.  The extensive data set is used that
              has been collected by the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau Seismic Network (CWBSN)
              from 1990 to 2000.  Rigorous tests are conducted on the correlation of
              shear-wave splitting and on other signals with regional crustal stress
              variations and lapse time before and after the Mw 7.6 event.  This data set
              extends back to 1970, providing a 30-year seismic database for monitoring the
              bulk crustal properties before, during, and after the Chi-Chi earthquake
              sequence.  The CWBSN operates a network of more than 650-station (at 5-km
              station spacing) of 3-component, large dynamic range, and broadband
              accelerographs and a network of 75-station 3-component high-gain short-period
              seismometers.  Thousands of M > 3 events from the middle-lower crust have been
              beautifully recorded with excellent S/N ratios.  For most M > 3 earthquake in
              the data set, found that there are a number of recording stations directly
              above the source with epicentral distance less than 20 km.  The software for
              this project performs particle polarization analysis and at the same time
              extracts the shear-wave spiltting delay times through an automated maximization
              of the cross-correlation function of the two matched horizontal component
              signals.  This allows accurate measurements to be made for testing the idea of
              shear-wave splitting as a potential indicator for a large earthquake in the
              future.  This research project has the potential of being more comprehensive
              and definitive than any shear-wave splitting work that has so far been done to
              date.
