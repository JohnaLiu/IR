Abstract    :
              This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) award will support a project
              investigating the application of near-field enhanced micro-Raman Spectroscopy
              to ferroelectric thin films.  Micro-Raman spectroscopy has been shown to be a
              useful tool for material characterization.  However, in transparent
              ferroelectric thin films grown on insulating substrates the Raman signal drops
              to undetectable levels.  In some materials the Raman signal can be enhanced
              through the use of the surface enhanced Raman scattering effect (SERS).  An
              attempt will be made to create SERS conditions in thin ferroelectric films of
              interest by introducing metallic (Au) nano-particles at the surface, the
              substrate interface, or within the bulk of the films.  A second method will
              employ a gold plated atomic force microscope (AFM) tip to act as a single
              metallic particle placed on the back side of a transparent substrate.  This
              second method will also be explored as a way to map out, on the nano-scale,
              properties of extended ferroelectric thin films. %%% Ferroelectric materials
              play a great role in many technological applications.  The next generation of
              advanced and compact integrated electronics will require thin films of new
              classes of complex electroceramic and other optoelectronic materials.  Recent
              developments in material processing and thin film fabrication techniques have
              made available high quality thin films suitable for these applications. 
              Ferroelectrics are a class of electroceramics that offer a wide range of useful
              properties that could be used to develop devices, such as smart sensors and
              structures, radiation-hard non-volatile computer memories, and pyroelectric
              detectors.  Successful implementation of these devices will require materials
              with well-defined properties and device figures of merit.  Micro-Raman
              spectroscopy has emerged as an excellent non-destructive tool for comprehensive
              materials characterization by investigating the effects of size, stress/strain,
              temperature, pressure, and electric field on the dynamic scattering behavior. 
              To obtain Raman signals of measurable strength from thin films, it is necessary
              to enhance the electric field strength of the exciting radiation.  The method
              of surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has proven to be extremely
              successful in applications to macroscopic systems.  The present exploratory
              research will investigate methods of applying the SERS process to characterize
              ferroelectric thin films in the nano-domain.. ***
