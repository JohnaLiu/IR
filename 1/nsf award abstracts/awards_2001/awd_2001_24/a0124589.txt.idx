Abstract    :
              The Mathematical Education of Teachers (MET), published in book form in August,
              2001, (and currently available on the CBMS web site www.maa.org/cbms), is the
              mathematics community's agenda for improving the mathematical preparation of
              future teachers. The Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS),
              which guided the development of this document, is launching MET with a Press
              Conference in September, 2001, (funded by the ExxonMobil Foundation) and a
              National Summit on the Mathematical Education of Teachers in November, 2001,
              both to be held in Washington DC. The Press Conference involves high profile
              leaders of the business community, the mathematics community, policy making
              organizations, and funding agencies, and focuses upon the policy implications
              of this report, positioning it as the mathematics community's plan to improve
              teacher education in mathematics. The National Summit engages 250 college and
              university mathematics faculty in the hard work of beginning to implement the
              vision of the mathematical education of teachers presented in MET. Participants
              are being invited in teams from about 75 diverse institutions across the
              country. Plenary sessions frame the issues and problems and set them in broader
              context. Small group working sessions engage the participants in thinking about
              how to address specific challenges in carrying out the recommendations MET
              locally.
