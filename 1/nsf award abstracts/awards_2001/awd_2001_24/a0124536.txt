This project will
              investigate the effect of small amounts of elasticity on the performance of
              fluids flowing through spray nozzles.  The work is motivated by a desire in the
              agricultural spraying industry to produce relatively monodisperse drop size
              distributions that can be effectively targeted to specific crop regions and can
              avoid dispersion over adjacent land.  This general problem is complicated by
              several issues, including (1) variations in nozzle design and application
              method, (2) variations in fluid properties, and (3) requirements for different
              sized drops for different applications.  The research described in this project
              will provide fundamental experimental results that will address all of the
              issues outlined above.  It is well known that adding polymer can enhance the
              drop properties in spraying applications.  This work will focus on
              well-characterized elastic liquids that will be employed in carefully designed
              nozzles to determine the impact of material properties and geometry on spray
              properties.
