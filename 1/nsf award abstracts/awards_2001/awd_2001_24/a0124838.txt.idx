Abstract    :
              Abstract  Award:  DMS-0124838 Principal Investigator:  David Eisenbud  The
              Banff International Research Station (BIRS), supported by the Mathematical
              Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley in collaboration with the Pacific
              Institute of the Mathematical Sciences in Vancouver, Canada, will provide an
              environment that optimizes creative interaction and the exchange of
              ideas, knowledge and methods within the mathematical sciences and
              with related sciences and industry. It is modeled on the extremely successful
              European mathematics centers in Oberwolfach and Luminy, and the US physics
              center in Aspen.  It is a collaborative Canada-US venture. BIRS will pursue an
              extremely broad program, embracing all aspects of the mathematical sciences,
              from the most fundamental work on the great problems of algebra, geometry and
              analysis to modern pure and applied mathematics, theoretical and applied
              statistics, financial and industrial mathematics, the mathematics of
              information technology and computer science, and bio-mathematics. Conferences
              on math education, and Schools ranging in level from high-school
              to postgraduate will also be regular features.  A conference center in
              Germany called Oberwolfach has played an enormously important role mathematics
              for more than half a century.  Conferences there bring the greatest
              mathematicians from around the world to Germany, and this flow of people
              and ideas is often credited with aiding the quick recovery of
              German mathematics from the devastation it suffered during the war.  It also
              helped by introducing generations of graduate students to the great men in
              their fields and to each other.  The Oberwolfach model was so successful that
              the French eventually copied it at the center in Luminy.  Senior US
              mathematicians are often visitors to these centers, but often graduate
              students and younger mathematicians from the United States and Canada are
              not invited, and there are many other ways in which those centers benefit
              Europe much more than the US. The physics center in Aspen has provided a
              resource for the US physics community that has provided related services, and
              the mathematicians who happen to have been involved have been impressed with
              what can be done in this mode. It has long been a dream of North
              American mathematicians to have a conference center of their own that would
              provide similar opportunities here, and the goal of the Banff International
              Research Station is to provide this important resource for mathematics and
              related fields.
