This project is to develop a new technology to create a
              biologically based source of clean hydrogen from wastewater.  The main barrier
              to efficient conversion of dissolved organic matter in wastewater is preventing
              interspecies hydrogen transfer so that hydrogen generated through fermentation
              processes is not lost to anaerobic microorganisms.   To prevent interspecies
              transfer, the microbes responsible for fermentation will be separated from
              those responsible for methane production using a two-tank membrane bioreactor. 
              The purpose of the membrane is to control cell detention time in the first
              reactor so that slow-growing methanogens are not able to exist in the first
              tank and will therefore be unable to significantly degrade the hydrogen
              produced from fermentation.  The reactor is to be operated in a mode that has
              been shown to limit membrane biofouling in suspended growth reactors.
