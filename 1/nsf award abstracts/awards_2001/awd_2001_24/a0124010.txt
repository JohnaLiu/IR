Abstract    :
              This request would support college students (graduate and undergraduate) to
              attend an international conference on "Computer Support for Collaborative
              Learning" (CSCL) of about 700 researchers and practitioners in Boulder Colorado
              in January 2002.   The theme for the conference is: foundations of the research
              field in theory, technology, methodology, and community building.  

The
              requested funds will support activities at conference such as creating a
              "community memory" which involves digital video, the Web, and DVD media to
              capture and disseminate ideas from the conference.  It will also support
              activities that involve teachers directly in the conference process in order to
              provide the other participants with the perspective of practitioners.  Also, it
              will support a doctoral consortium to introduce graduate students to the
              research community as they explain their dissertation work.
