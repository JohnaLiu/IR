Abstract    :
              Sufficiently fast fluid flows over erodible beds of sand and gravel entrain
              surface particles, which then roll and hop along as bedload.  This project aims
              to develop quantitative predictive relations between fluid flow and bedload
              transport that more precisely incorporate the role of the fluctuating flow
              velocities due to turbulence, which always is present.  Such relations will
              apply to the non-uniform or unsteady flows that are ubiquitous in streams and
              beneath waves and will provide new insight into the formation of erosional and
              depositional sedimentary features from ripples and dunes to bars and channels
              to sorting and grading.  The project will investigate (1) turbulence structure
              and bedload transport over simple bedforms such as bedload sheets and low
              dunes, (2) turbulence structure over abrupt streamwise changes in bed
              roughness, (3) turbulence structure and the fluctuating forces on fixed natural
              bed particles, (4) turbulence structure and the fluid forces that act on
              bedload particles during entrainment, and (5) the modification of fluid
              velocity and turbulence structure by moving bedload particles.  In addition,
              the project will further develop our discrete-particle computational model for
              sediment transport by (1) incorporating into it better treatment of the lift
              forces on bed and bedload particles and of the reaction forces on the fluid as
              the particles accelerate and (2) coupling it with an existing numerical
              simulation of turbulent flow over three-dimensional bedforms.  The proposed
              research addresses three intertwined issues: how the forces exerted on
              particles on the bed and moving over it are related to the temporal and spatial
              distribution of the near-bed fluid velocities, how the entrainment and motion
              of those particles are related to the forces, and how the near-bed fluid
              velocities are modified by the presence of the moving bedload.
