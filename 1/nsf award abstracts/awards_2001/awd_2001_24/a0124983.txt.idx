Abstract    :
              Abstract  Research Mentoring for Junior Faculty in Human Sciences  Richard
              Fabes  The need to develop competitive grantsmanship skills is particularly
              evident among junior faculty.  Senior faculty from Arizona State University and
              Auburn University propose to bring together outstanding junior faculty from
              departments of Human Sciences to interact with, and learn from, senior faculty
              who have been successful in obtaining research funding.  The objective of the
              workshop is to establish a mechanism whereby senior faculty provide guidance
              and mentoring to these junior faculty in order to increase their abilities in
              obtaining research support.  Underrepresented young scholars in Human Science
              programs will be specifically targeted for participation.
