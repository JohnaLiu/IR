Abstract    :
              This project will develop a prioritized research agenda for studies of the
              effects of climate change and variability on estuarine systems. Although there
              is a general understanding of the physical effects of such changes, the
              consequences to the biodiversity and functioning of these ecosystems-or their
              biocomplexity-are poorly understood.  The investigators are particularly
              interested in the mechanisms by which estuarine and coastal biocomplexity
              allows ecosystems to adapt to climate forcing in the context of human
              population impacts. Drs. Boesch and Giblin plan a community town meeting at the
              biennial conference of the Estuarine Research Federation, and a focused
              workshop involving estuarine, social and climate scientists. The objective of
              these meetings is to facilitate idea sharing and team building among climate
              change scientists, social scientists and scientists working in traditional
              estuarine disciplines.  This project is expected to accelerate the involvement
              of the estuarine science community in addressing the complex and critically
              important questions of climate change effects in the fragile coastal zone.
