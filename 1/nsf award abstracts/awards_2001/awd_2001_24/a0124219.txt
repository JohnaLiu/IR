Abstract    :
              Proposal - 0124219
P.I. - Alberts

The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,
              on behalf of the Academic Research Fleet proposes to undertake a multiple
              procurement of electro-mechanical oceanographic cables, torque-balanced wire
              rope, and fiber optic cable to meet the needs of the research fleet for a
              12-month period beginning 1 November 2001.

Since 1982 similar efforts in the
              procurement of both electro-mechanical oceanographic cable and wire rope have
              resulted in substantial cost savings as compared to procurement by individual
              laboratories, as well as a better utilization of available stock.  In the past
              reels of cable were consigned directly to universities at the time of
              manufacture to meet their immediate needs.  Subsequent requirements were filled
              from "Pool" inventories.  In 1992, the procedure of delivering all new
              procurements to the cable pools in San Diego and Woods Hole was initiated.  The
              result is that currently all cables are allotted to UNOLS vessels from the
              pools as the need arises.  This will continue.  The Woods Hole Oceanographic
              Institution proposes to act in the management role for the inspection,
              acceptance, maintenance, record keeping and storage of the cables and ropes. 
              The pools will remain under the control of the National Science Foundation.
