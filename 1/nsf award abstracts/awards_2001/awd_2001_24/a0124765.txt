Abstract    :
              This project addresses the design, synthesis, characterization, processing and
              applications of novel multifunctional heterogeneous catalysts for
              environmentally benign and high efficiency organic transformations in aqueous
              media. It emphasizes metallic, organometallic-complex, and multifunctional
              catalysts capable of catalyzing multiple reactions simultaneously, examining
              the activity and selectivity of the catalysts for industrially important
              organic reactions, and engineering the structures and catalytic chemistry to
              achieve optimal performance through a fundamental understanding of catalytic
              reactions. This multidisciplinary project involving chemistry, chemical
              engineering, materials science, and environmental science provides a strong
              opportunity to integrate research with education to address important
              industrial issues such as how to reduce volatile and toxic organic pollutants
              in the environment.  

The development of new catalysts and methodologies for
              efficient and environmentally benign transformations of volatile organic
              pollutants will  help achieve sustainable long-term economic growth while
              maintaining a cleaner industrial environment. Students trained in the
              synthesis, characterization, processing, optimization and recovery of catalysts
              will be highly competitive in both  the academic and industrial job market.
              This Technology for a Sustainable Environment project is part of the National
              Science Foundation / Environmental Protection Administration partnership
              program. It is being jointly supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary
              Activities and the Division of Materials Research.
