Three projects will assess or utilize mass
              transport by diffusion in silicate melts to better understand the properties of
              granitic liquids.  In Project I, we will complete a self-consistent
              thermodynamic, kinetic, and transport model for the crystallization of
              water-bearing granite melts under near- and far-from-equilibrium conditions.
              The mathematical algorithms are now mostly developed, and we have recently
              completed a large number of 
experiments that provide constraints on the
              kinetics of crystallization in the granite system. Project II addresses a
              simple but intriguing question, namely how do granitic melts become homogeneous
              by diffusion through the melt (i.e., once eutectic grain-boundary contacts are
              lost)?  Preliminary experiments indicate that rapid diffusion of alkalis
              promotes the attainment of an equilibrium proportion of alkali feldspar
              components throughout the melt, and that mixing then occurs between this alkali
              feldspar component and silica derived from the melting of quartz. Project III
              will address longstanding presumptions about the relationships among
              ore-forming metals (e.g., Nb, Ta, Sn, W, Zr, Hf, and REE) and potential ligands
              (halogens F, and Cl, and oxyanions of H, B, P).  Not only will the case for
              speciation be tested, but the stoichiometry of the probable melt species, along
              with their diffusion coefficients, will be derived.  The results of Project III
              will elucidate the extent to which anions other than oxygen enhance or
              
decrease the solubility of ore-forming metals in melt.
