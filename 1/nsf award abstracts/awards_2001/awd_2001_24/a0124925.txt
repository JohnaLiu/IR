Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will apply agile
              manufacturing, and lean production concepts in studying the real time workflow
              patterns at plant level in a manufacturing-related company. The results will be
              used to develop a new generation ERP (enterprise resource planning) software
              system.  This project will develop a web-based modularized software for
              upper/middle levels and as well as shop-floor-level production planning,
              execution, monitoring, and evaluation using agile manufacturing and lean
              production principles.

The commercial application will be directed toward
              the U.S. Manufacturing industry.  This new ERP system will provide rapid and
              quality responses to plant-level production needs of manufacturers.
