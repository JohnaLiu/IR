Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to increase the number of women entering graduate
              programs in CISE areas by providing opportunities for female undergraduates to
              be involved in research projects with mentors at major research universities so
              as to experience research and graduate life.  The Distributed Mentor Project
              (DMP) has been running successfully since 1994 and CRA proposes to build on
              that success by significantly increasing the number of students participating
              in DMP.  To do this, CRA will initiate a new outreach program targeted at
              undergraduate institutions and universities without active research programs. 
              The project will initially provide support for 30 students and will increase
              that number by 5 each year until, by the fifth year, 45 students will be
              working with experienced qualified mentors during the summer months.  In
              addition, the project includes a significant evaluation component, a plan for
              dissemination of the results of the evaluation, and a plan to secure long-term
              funding and therefore institutionalization of the project from industry and
              other foundations.
