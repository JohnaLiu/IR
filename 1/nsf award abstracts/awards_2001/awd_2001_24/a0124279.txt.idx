Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funding for an advanced network connection in order to
              facilitate research and education in the areas of real-time surfzone wave,
              current and morphology observations, impacts of mesoscale processes on
              biogeochemical fluxes in the North Atlantic, topics in the role of the Arctic
              Ocean, organic geochemistry of subsurface gas flow, and subsurface sensing and
              imaging systems.  In addition, this award will enable new projects in the areas
              of a 10 Gigabit per second network on the seafloor around the Juan de Fuca
              plate (offshore Oregon and Washington), a Martha's Vineyard Coastal
              Observatory, and the temporal and spatial dependence of broadband ambient
              seismic noise.
