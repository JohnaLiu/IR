Abstract    :
              Under their previous grant, the PIs have shown that diabatic heat anomalies at
              the surface due to snow have large and extensive impacts on atmospheric
              dynamics, especially in mid- to high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (NH).
              Work under this award will examine the role of snow cover in forcing or
              triggering the dominant mode of variability of NH winter climate. Two parallel
              paths of research will be followed: (i) to focus on the relationship between
              Eurasian snow cover and winter climate through observational analysis; and (ii)
              to study cause and effect mechanisms using general circulation modeling. The
              work is important because it will enhance understanding of NH winter climate
              variability, and consequently, the potential of improved seasonal forecasting.
              This has great societal benefits.
