Abstract    :
              Most research on foreign direct investment (FDI) examines the manufacturing
              sector yet the service sector has been growing significantly over the last
              decade. For example, in the late 1980s, the average annual inflow of foreign
              acquisitions in services amounted to $22 billion, nearly three times the yearly
              amount in the first half of the decade and at a rate comparable with
              investments in manufacturing.  Between 1983 and 1988, the worldwide stock of
              service foreign direct investment by Japan, West Germany, and France, increased
              by more than 20 percent per annum totaling $757 billion dollars. This suggests
              that the foreign presence in U.S. service sectors is expanding rapidly;
              however, research in this area remains sparse.  This project involves planning
              research to answer three important questions related to Japanese foreign direct
              investment into U.S. service sectors: (1) Do volatile exchange rates deter
              Japanese service FDI? (2) Are Japanese plants less likely to fail if they
              invest in U.S. service industries that support their U.S. manufacturing
              operations, and (3) What determines whether a Japanese firm acquires a U.S.
              firm, builds a new plant in the U.S., or enters into a joint venture with a
              U.S. firm?  This project aids in answering important questions regarding
              policy on Japanese FDI into the U.S. and U.S. competition with Japanese firms.
              Many services can only be delivered to foreign markets if they are produced in
              those markets, hence understanding the motives for service FDI and firm
              behavior after entry is imperative.
