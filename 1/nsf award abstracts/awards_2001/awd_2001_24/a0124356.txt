This 3-day workshop
              will assemble quantitative stratigraphers and database specialists from diverse
              research teams.  The goals are to coordinate database standards and
              compatibility; design strategies and tools for information retrieval and
              analysis of all types of global and regional stratigraphic data; and to discuss
              future directions for database integration and centralization of currently
              distributed depositories.  The workshop will (1) propose standards for
              stratigraphic data storage, formatting, retrieval and conversions, (2) identify
              key needs for data acquisition, accessibility and manipulation tools, and (3)
              recommend a development strategy for the necessary integration of
              infrastructure for present and future growth of a distributed stratigraphic
              database system
