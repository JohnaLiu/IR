This award provides partial support for
              participants at the
Sixteenth Summer Conference on Topology and  Its
              Applications,  
to take place July 18-21, 2001 at City College in New York,
              NY.
This Conference series addresses the need of topologists  to 
share new
              ideas at a time of year when most are free of academic commitments, a need
              demonstrated by its continued growth.  
This series began in 1984 at the City
              College of New York with 35 participants and 13 talks. Over the past decade,
              attendance has averaged  about 150,  with participants all inhabited 
              continents 
and  about 100  talks.  Today, after much concentration on
              
problems internal to  topology, emphasis in this field is again  turning
              toward  applications to other areas.  Thus we have 
organized the following
              Special Sessions: Asymmetric Topology and Computer Science, Dynamical Systems,
              Topological Algebra and 
Functional Analysis, Set-theoretic Topology, and
              Topological 
Groups and Semigroups.  Further  information, including  invited 
              speakers, schedule of talks, and housing information, is available 
at
              sumtopo.att.net.
