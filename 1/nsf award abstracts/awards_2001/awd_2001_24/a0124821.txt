The objective of this project is to perform combinatorial
              mutagenesis to improve the functioning of a Fe-hydrogenase for the production
              of hydrogen gas from algae in the presence of oxygen.  The specific components
              of the research include: (1) the Fe-hydrogenase sequences of multiple organisms
              will be used as the basis for a PCR-mediated multi-parent shuffle to create
              recombinant hydrogenase sequences, (2) these sequences will be cloned into a
              Chlamydomonas vector, the vectors will be transformed into C. reinhardtii, and
              transformants for oxygen-resistant hydrogen production will be selected using a
              chemical selection procedure, and (3) a subset of the survivors will be
              selected using chemochromic and gas chromatographic hydrogen production assays.
               The goal of this research is an oxygen tolerant Fe-hydrogenase that may
              ultimately combined with other oxygen-inhibition-elimination mechanisms to
              facilitate commercial algal hydrogen production.
