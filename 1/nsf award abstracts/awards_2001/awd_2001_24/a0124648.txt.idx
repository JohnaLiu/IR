Abstract    :
              Technology for a Sustainable Environment: Novel Hydrogen Reactor/Separator
              Design for a Fuel Cell Vehicle Infrastructure   James M. Fenton University
              of Connecticut  Abstract  This project explores the merits of a new type of
              membrane for high-temperature hydrogen purification so that pure hydrogen can
              be obtained directly from a hydrocarbon steam reformer. The new membrane is
              fabricated from a class of ceramic compounds called perovskites that can be
              formulated to be both electron and proton conductors. These conductivities
              allow the hydrogen produced by the reforming reaction to be converted to
              electrons and protons on one surface of the membrane and converted to pure
              hydrogen on the other surface. In addition to producing pure hydrogen for
              fuel-cell use, extracting the hydrogen directly from the reformer shifts the
              reaction equilibrium to favor the formation of more hydrogen. Samples of these
              membrane materials are being fabricated and their properties determined for use
              in this application. Hydrogen permeability is measured and calculations
              performed to design an integrated reformer-purifier.  Current
              proton-exchange-membrane fuel-cell systems require a complex fuel processor
              containing several components to produce a hydrogen gas of suitable purity for
              use in the fuel cell. This new hydrogen reactor/separator provides a smaller,
              simpler fuel processor for use in fuel cell systems. For on-board vehicular
              hydrogen production from gasoline, fuel-cell-system power density will be
              increased, startup time and transient thermal response will be improved, and
              cost reduced. Also, for either vehicles or stationary power generation, this
              unit will allow use of the existing natural-gas infrastructure for the
              formation of a hydrogen infrastructure through a network of small, low cost
              natural-gas reformers. These advances could have a significant impact on the
              rate of fuel cell commercialization to maintain a sustainable environment. 
              Pollution that now results from fuel combustion will be prevented.
