Abstract    :
              This recommendation memo provides support and justification for funding the
              Principal Investigator to participate in a DELOS Digital Libraries Workshop to
              be held in San Cassiano, Italy in June, 2001. This meeting, entitled "Digital
              Libraries: Future Research Directions for a European Research Programme," is
              expected to be a seminal event for producing the core intellectual agenda and
              operational framework for the next phase of European activities in digital
              libraries research and applications.  The US and EU agendas are naturally
              linked by common goals to achieve interoperability at the networking, systems,
              content, usage and other stages in the information lifecycle.  A long-term
              overall goal is the development of shared resources for a global information
              cyber-infrastructure. The meeting is being organized by the DELOS Network of
              Excellence on Digital Libraries, in cooperation with the Cultural Heritage
              Applications Unit of the 5th FP IST Programme of the European Commission.
