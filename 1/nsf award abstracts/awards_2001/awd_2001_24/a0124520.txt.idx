Abstract    :
              The proposal plans to connect SIUC to the Illinois Century Network, MREN, and
              then to the Abilene Network for research and education purposes: Soybean Genome
              Integration and Publication Project requiring real time instructional access to
              large remote data sets;  Apoliptoprotein Structure Project requiring an
              advanced connection due to delay sensitive tranfer of NMR control information
              and its latency sensitivy vs. bandwidth requirements; and 3-D vizualization of
              Geological Structures
