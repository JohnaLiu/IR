This two-year award supports U.S.-France collaboration in
              materials research between Richard T. Scalettar, University of California,
              Davis, and George Batrouni of the University of Nice.  The project addresses
              the problem of interacting, disordered electron systems.  The objective is to
              determine quantum phase transitions in disordered superfluids and
              superconductors using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. The investigators will
              conduct numerical simulations of the Boson-Hubbard model for superfluids and of
              supersolid formation in the Fermion-Hubbard model.  The US investigator brings
              to the collaboration expertise in fermion determinant QMC methods.  This is
              complemented by French expertise in dual algorithm bosonic QMC.

Disordered
              electron systems exhibit remarkable properties including universal
              conductivity, two-dimensional metal-insulator and superconductor insulator
              phase transition, zero temperature liquid behavior and novel glassy phases.
              These systems represent fundamental problems in solid state physics and have
              important technological applications.
 
This award represents the US side of
              parallel proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific
              Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses of the US
              investigator and student.  The CNRS will support the visits of the French
              researchers. The collaboration will advance fundamental understanding of
              disordered electron systems in solid state physics and provides an
              international research training opportunity for a US student.
