Abstract    :
              The adaptation of natural communities to changing environments is of growing
              practical concern.  Rising sea levels and increased salinity are impacting
              coastal ecosystems, interactions between plants and animals, and community
              structure.  We will investigate how Iris hexagona, a native freshwater species,
              responds to rising salinity, spatial isolation, and flower consumption by deer.
              Previous results indicate that salinity stress reduces biomass, but increases
              seed production.  In contrast, large-scale flower consumption by deer
              eliminates seed production and stimulates vegetative growth.  This
              interdisciplinary project combines field experiments, phytochemistry, molecular
              genetics, and predictive modeling.  Field experiments will examine how
              interactions between salinity and deer influence growth, sexual and clonal
              reproduction, and belowground dynamics of I. hexagona populations.
              Phytochemical analyses will investigate physiological responses to salinity
              stress, including phytohormone, nutrients and minerals, proteins, and volatile
              floral compounds.  Genetic analyses will reveal variation within and between
              freshwater and saltmarsh I. hexagona populations.  Quantitative modeling will
              integrate our findings to predict plant population growth and the evolution of
              salinity-tolerance. This project can help advance our understanding of how
              coastal ecosystems and their natural communities respond to global climate
              change.
