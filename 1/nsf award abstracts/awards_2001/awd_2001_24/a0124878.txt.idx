Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to investigate the retrieval and reuse of
              information in organizations. Research has shown that many organizations waste
              valuable information because these processes are complicated and difficult.
              Detailed systematic insights are necessary to understand how organizations can
              more effectively reuse information and engage in productive "knowledge
              management" practices. Based on their previous work, the PIs will examine key
              theoretical issues through micro-level distributed cognition analyses in two
              technical support organizations to better understand these processes and
              organizational practices. Such a project is necessary to move beyond the hype
              often associated with the discourse about knowledge management in the scholarly
              and management literatures.
