Abstract    :
              The proposal focuses on determining the mechanisms of reactions catalyzed by
              heteropolyacids.  A goal of the work is to understand the role of trace amounts
              of water in enhancing the performance of these catalysts.  The experimental
              tasks will focus on catalyst characterization and the computational one will
              make use of DFT calculations to characterize reaction mechanisms.  The effects
              of water treatments on catalyst activity will be examined during hydrocarbon
              isomerization and alkylation reactions over supported heteropolyacids.  Other
              important goals are to develop stable solid acid alkylation catalysts that are
              active at low temperatures and to identify factors controlling acid site
              density and strength in solid acid catalysts.  Computational efforts will be
              aimed at understanding plausible mechanisms for hydrocarbon activation, which
              can lead to isomerization and alkylation, over tungsten heteropolyacids.  The
              role of water on the structure of the working catalyst and the relationships
              between the degree of hydration and the activity of these materials will be
              investigated. This work has the potential to lead to the development of
              improved solid acid catalysts, which can replace environmentally less desirable
              liquid acid based processes.
