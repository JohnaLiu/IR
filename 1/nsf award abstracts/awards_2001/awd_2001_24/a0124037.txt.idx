Abstract    :
              This is a tie project between the Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center for Biocatalysis and Bioprocessing of Macromolecules at the Polytechnic
              University of New York, and the I/UCRC for Advanced Studies on Novel
              Surfactants at Columbia University, New York.  The research program includes
              (1) synthesis of new functional polymers from renewable resources by selective
              biocatalytic transformations, and (2) investigation of fundamental
              relationships between the polymer structures, adsorption and conformational
              characteristics at surfaces and interfaces.  Surface and interfacial properties
              of the polymers and copolymers synthesized at the Polytechnic University will
              be studied at the I/UCRC at Columbia University.  A companion award
              (EEC-0124037) will support the research at the Columbia University.
