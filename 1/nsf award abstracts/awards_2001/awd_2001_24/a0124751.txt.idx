Abstract    :
              Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions from the refrigeration and air conditioning
              sector in the U.S. currently amount to approximately 13 million metric tons of
              carbon equivalent (MMTCE).  This number is expected to grow to 27 and 38 MMTCE
              in 2005 and 2010, respectively.  Second only to automotive refrigeration
              systems, retail food refrigeration accounts for 25% of these emissions: a
              typical supermarket leaks about 1 ton of refrigerants every year.   Secondary
              refrigeration loops have the potential to reduce primary refrigerant charges to
              as little as 10% of that required in a traditional refrigeration system. 
              Nonetheless, secondary refrigeration has found acceptance in only about 200 out
              of over 30,000 supermarkets and 300,000 convenience stores in the U.S. With
              profit margins comparable to their electric bills, retail food enterprises are
              concerned that secondary refrigerants may not be as energy-efficient as the
              HFCs that are currently used in direct refrigeration.  Improving the energy
              efficiency in this sector is of government concern as well since the retail
              food industry currently accounts for approximately 4% of electricity
              consumption in the nation.  The primary goal of this project is to work
              towards addressing the following questions: (a) What are the families of
              compounds that can act as secondary refrigeration fluids? (b) What is the
              energy efficiency of these compounds and how does it compare to that of the
              HFCs that are currently used in direct refrigeration? (c) Are these compounds
              safe and environmentally benign?  Towards answering these questions, this
              project integrates theoretical and experimental research that will: (1)
              develop a mathematical model which selects the atomic composition of a
              refrigerant in such a way that environmental and chemical constraints are
              satisfied while the energy efficiency, total warming impact of the refrigerant
              life-cycle, and other economic and environmental objectives are optimized; (2)
              devise an algorithmic procedure to solve the above model in a way that
              overcomes the combinatorial difficulty of the problem as well as difficulties
              associated with nonlinearities in property prediction estimation
              techniques; (3) establish an experimental procedure for calibrating the
              mathematical model through measurement of physical properties of potential
              refrigerants; (4) verify experimentally the theoretical findings through
              laboratory synthesis of compounds identified by the model and measurement of
              their thermal transfer properties in actual refrigeration equipment.
