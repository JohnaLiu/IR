Abstract    :
              Delineation of crustal elements of different origins and histories found in
              ancient orogenic belts is a prerequisite to meaningful tectonic analysis. In
              the S. Appalachian orogen, a classic collisional system, it has proven
              difficult to convincingly assign units to Laurentia or to the opposing
              continental mass, Gondwana. Lack of clear-cut evidence has stymied full
              understanding of the otherwise well-known belt that has been instrumental in
              the development of major tectonic concepts. This project will investigate the
              hypothesis that the Smith River Allochthon in the Piedmont Zone, previously
              thought to be of peri-Laurentian or transitional affinity is, in fact, of
              exotic (Gondwana) origin. Results are of considerable local importance, and
              because the Appalachians provide an influential model for interpretation of
              other ancient tectonic belts, has broad significance.
