Abstract    :
              The 2002 Keystone Symposium on "Chromatin Structure and Activity" will be held
              January 26-31, 2002, in Sante Fe, New Mexico.  The objective of this meeting is
              to provide a forum for graduate students, postdocs and leading chromatin
              researchers to interact and discuss the current status of the fiels.  Many
              exciting discoveries have revealed an intimate relation between chromatin
              structure and transcriptional activity.  Some transcriptional coregulators
              function to modulate chromatin structure.  Other coregulators catalyze
              reversible chemical modifications of chromatin that enhance or repress gene
              expression.  Beyond the basic chromatin filament, higher-order chromatin
              structures are involved in the regulation of enhancer activity and in global
              transcriptional repression.  In addition, new experimental approaches to the
              study of chromatin structure and function are being devised.  It is anticipated
              that current models will be refined and, in some instances, disputed.  In this
              manner, there will emerge new concepts and ideas on the molecular mechanisms by
              which chromatin functions in the cell. This project will provide funding for
              the participation of graduate students, postdocs, and new independent
              investigators that lack funding. Specific emphasis will be placed upon the
              financial support of individuals from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups.
