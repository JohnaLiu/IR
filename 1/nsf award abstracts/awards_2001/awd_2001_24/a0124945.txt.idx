Abstract    :
              The proposal plans to connect SMAST (School for Marine Science and Technology)
              directly to the Northern Crossroads GigaPoP in Boston and then to the Abilene
              Network in support of the following research and education activities  Become
              a major supplier and clearinghouse for distributed data and information related
              to its programs in ocean environmental observation/modeling and fisheries
              oceanography and management research. C Collaborate more effectively with its
              Harvard University colleagues on the  development of data assimilation modeling
              system. Become more actively engaged in the real-time exchange of large
              observational and model data that accompanies our joint development of an
              Advanced Fisheries Management Information System (AFMIS). Collaborate more
              effectively with colleagues in (1) large eddy simulation modeling of coastal
              winter-mixed layer evolution and (2) direct numerical simulation of ocean
              physical-biological systems on a remote supercomputer. Collaborate more
              effectively in its GLOBEC/Georges Bank studies on the relation of
              satellite-derived temperature fields and biology. The establishment of an
              ACCESS GRID node would establish reliable support for distributed (remote)
              research and education collaborations. Provide IGS/SMAST researchers and
              students with high-speed access to the virtual libraries that are being built
              to augment traditional libraries. Begin employing advanced visualization
              technology to analyze and synthesize results
