Abstract    :
              During secondary aluminum processing, oxidation of the aluminum in reverberatory
              furnaces leads to the formation of dross, which contains aluminum in metallic
              form that is entrapped within its oxide.  Among the detrimental effects are
              loss of aluminum, promotion of metallurgical defects in aluminum products and
              reduced furnace efficiency, due to the insulation effects of the dross layer. 
              The PI proposes to study the transport processes that lead to dross formation
              through a numerical and experimental study of the oxidation of molten aluminum
              alloys in a furnace environment. The goal will be to determine optimal furnace
              conditions that will minimize the formation of dross.  The project is
              collaborative between the University of Illinois at Chicago and the Gas
              Technology Institute. Reduction of dross formation has potential for
              significant increases in energy efficiency and reduction of waste in this
              industry, which produces 1/3 of the aluminum produced in the United States.
