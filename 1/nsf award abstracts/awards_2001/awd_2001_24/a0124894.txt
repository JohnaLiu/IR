Abstract    :
              Transfer of organic material and organisms from Arctic shelves to the deep
              Arctic
basin may impact significantly the biogeochemical characteristics, and
              ecosystem
function and structure, of both Arctic basin and the Arctic shelf
              ecosystems. However,
the physical and biological processes influencing both
              the distribution of organisms and
biological material on the Arctic shelves
              and the potential input of these materials into the
Arctic Ocean and basin
              presently are poorly understood. It is critical to increase
understanding of
              the biological-physical coupling in the shelf-slope region in order to
better
              predict the potential impact of large-scale changes in climate on the
              Arctic
ecosystem.  The project will describe the role of mesoscale physical
              processes in the
exchange or transport of biogenic material and plankton
              populations between the Chukchi
Shelf and neighboring Beaufort Sea as part of
              the Shelf Basin Interactions Phase II field
program (SBI). The proposed
              research has two distinct yet interrelated components: 1) description of the
              abundance, taxonomic and size composition of plankton and particles and aspects
              of behavior of plankton in physical features at two locations along the
              Beaufort/Chukchi shelf break during two July-August process cruises (2002 and
              2004) using a Video Plankton Recorder, 2) a description of the abundance of
              zooplankton on the outer shelf and upper slope and the mesoscale physical
              features that exchange water and biogenic materials between the two regions
              over two annual cycles using the absolute backscatter intensity data from an
              array of fourteen moored calibrated acoustic Doppler current profilers.
