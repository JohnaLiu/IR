Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
The recent sequencing of the human genome and
              continuing efforts to sequence and analyze genetic sequences of many species
              demonstrate the need for effective pedagogies in genomic studies. This project
              acquires the equipment and develops the materials necessary to engage
              undergraduate students in a novel genome project adapting and implementing
              materials from James Madison University. A DNA sequencer and sequence analysis
              software are being used to initiate the Lynx Genome Project as a unit in the
              Molecular Biology Laboratory course. Students are sequencing cDNA clones from
              lynx species (the Rhodes College mascot) and using the resulting data in
              evolutionary and functional prediction analyses. Results are expected to lead
              to insights in efforts to conserve these threatened species. High school
              students and teachers, a significant number of whom are members of groups
              underrepresented in the sciences, are participating through a Summer Scholars
              Program.
