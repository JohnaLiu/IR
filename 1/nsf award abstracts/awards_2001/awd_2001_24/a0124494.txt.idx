Abstract    :
              0124494 Snyder  This award will support Michael Snyder and colleagues at the
              American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to travel to Seoul,
              Korea for a feasibility study aimed at developing plans for the pilot program
              of an international science and engineering youth summer camp in South Korea. 
              AAAS will work with the Korea Science Foundation and the Korea-US Science
              Cooperation Center in developing their plans.  The primary objective of the
              study is to explore the possibilities of giving American youth with
              demonstrated interest in science and technology a hands-on research and
              educational experience in an international context.
