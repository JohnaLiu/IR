This Americas Program award will support Dr. Milton W.
              Cole of the Pennsylvania State University Park in collaboration with Dr. Susana
              Hernandez of the University of Buenos Aires.  The research aim is to predict
              the behavior of fluids in confined geometries.  These include films, carbon
              nanotubes and porous media.  The emphasis will be on quantum fluids but some
              attention will be given to classical fluids as well.  

The research effort
              will bring together successful research groups with the U.S. side contributing
              their expertise in forces and statistical mechanics associated with physically
              absorbed film, while the Argentina side will contribute their expertise in
              many-body theory to treat quantum films, clusters, and their
              excitations.
