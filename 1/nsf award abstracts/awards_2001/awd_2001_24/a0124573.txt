Abstract    :
              The proposal plans to connect Fond du Lac to the University of Minnesota at
              Duluth and then to the Abilene Network. Fond du Lac Tribal and Community
              College (FLTCC) has excellent existing computing facilities for a community
              college and is able to leverage their facilities and projects jointly with the
              University of  Minnesota. The connection will be used to enable ongoing
              collaborations with the forestry institute and the University of  Minnesota.
