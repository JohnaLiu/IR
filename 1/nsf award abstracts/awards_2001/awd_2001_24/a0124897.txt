Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to continue research aimed at improving and
              expanding the technology of immunomagnetic cell separation.  This technique can
              be used to separate stem cells, cancer cells and fetal cells from other
              components of whole blood as well as pathogens from food.  The specific goals
              of this research are to: (1) measure the degree to which cells are
              immunomagnetically labeled using Cell Tracking Velocimetry, (2) explore the
              fundamental relationships and parameters that govern magnetophoretic mobility,
              and (3) continue experimental studies on a variety of cell and immunomagnetic
              labeling systems.
