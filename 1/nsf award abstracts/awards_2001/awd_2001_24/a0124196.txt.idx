Abstract    :
              The goals of this project are to help facilitate development of community
              consensus regarding planning for ocean observations, long time series and
              observatory systems and to provide technical expertise to OCEAN.US. This will
              be accomplished through workshops designed to bring disparate participants
              together for strategic discussions on the future of technology and through
              coordination with other planning activities internationally.
