Abstract    :
              CTS- 0124237  Toxic and Nutrient Pollution Prevention by Use of Anion Binding
              Polymeric Hydrogels  Peter Kofinas, University of
              Maryland  ABSTRACT Methods that will effectively remove nutrient and toxic
              anion pollutants even at extremely low concentrations from wastewater effluents
              are a major environmental need.   This work develops an approach that
              introduces novel crosslinked cationic polymeric materials for removal of such
              anions from aqueous waste streams.  Phosphate, nitrate, and perchlorate-binding
              polymeric amine hydrogels are being synthesized using various crosslinkers. 
              Their morphology is being characterized by use of atomic force microscopy, and
              the rate of anion transport as well as anion-binding capacity of these
              hydrogels is being optimized though testing in various wastewater conditions in
              batch experiments and lab-scale packed column systems.  An economic evaluation
              of the cost to produce bulk quantities of the polymers will be developed, and
              the possibilities for adsorbent regeneration or disposal will be
              explored.  This project has local and regional significance within the
              vicinity of the Chesapeake Bay, but it also addresses national issues important
              to environmental managers and the general public concerned with the
              eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems. Missile propellants containing toxic
              perchlorate anions and poultry farms and aquaculture facilities which discharge
              nutrient pollutants to natural waters pose a serious pollution problem.  The
              ability of the proposed hydrogels to bind phosphates, nitrates, and
              perchlorates from such effluents may lead to a cheap and efficient way to
              remove nutrient and toxic anions in wastewater-generating systems before the
              water is discharged and to control pollution at the source for some of the most
              difficult environmental problems facing the U.S.
