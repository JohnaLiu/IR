The objective of this project is to optimize the activity and
              expression of monooxygenases for the purpose of converting naphthalene to
              1-naphthol and (chiral) styrene epoxide.  Replacing the current method for
              producing 1-naphthol and styrene epoxide with the proposed enzymatic
              alternative may prove to be more environmentally benign in that less solvent
              and by-product wastes will result.  There are two components to the work: (1)
              enzyme "breeding" (University of Connecticut) and (2) regulation of expression
              and bioprocess optimization (University of Maryland), which are highly
              synergistic.
