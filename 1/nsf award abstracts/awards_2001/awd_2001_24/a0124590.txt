Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the properties of ultrafine (particle diameters
              less than 0.1 micrometer) aerosol aggregates in the atmosphere.  Aerosol
              aggregates with high carbon content may significantly affect light absorption
              and scattering and hence the global radiation balance.  Particles in this size
              range are also of public health concern.  The morphology of aerosol aggregates
              in the atmosphere will be studied, including the fractal dimension and number
              and size of the primary particles that compose the aggregates, concentrations
              and size distribution of the aggregates, and fraction of total ultrafine
              particles that are aggregates.  These properties are important because aerosol
              transport rates and gas-particle partitioning factors can vary as a function of
              aggregate morphology, affecting the atmospheric residence time and patterns of
              deposition of aerosols in the lung and on other surfaces.
