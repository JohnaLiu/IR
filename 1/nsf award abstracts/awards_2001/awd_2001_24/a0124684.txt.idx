Abstract    :
              The proposal plans to connect Bowling Green to OARNet and then to the Abilene
              Network to enable parallel rendering research in the areas of numerical
              relativity and relativistic astrophysics.  The PI also proposes the development
               of an "Internet2 Task Force" on campus to help promote the use of the
              high-speed network resources by other researchers.
