Abstract    :
              This award provides support of the ACS Polymer Division symposium Nobel
              Laureates n Polymer Chemistry, to be held on Monday, 27 August 2001 at the
              National ACS Meeting in Chicago, Illinois.  These funds will be used to
              facilitate attendance of 1 young faculty member and 3 graduate
              students/postdocs.

The 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was won by
              Professors Hideki Shirakawa (Tskuba University), Alan MacDiarmid (University of
              Pennsylvania), and Alan Heeger (UC California, Santa Barbara).  In the Nobel
              laureates in Polymer Chemistry Symposium, the winners of the 2000 Nobel
              Laureates in Polymer Chemistry Symposium, the winners of the 2000 Nobel prize
              in Chemistry will give lectures in the exact order of their Nobel addresses
              that were given in Stockholm in December 2000.  This Symposium is scheduled for
              Monday, 27 August 2001 at the Chicago ACS Meeting.  To recognize the importance
              of international interdisciplinary research in polymer science and the
              longstanding research collaborations with Japanese polymer scientists, The
              Society of Polymer Science of Japan (SPSJ) was asked to "cosponsor" the "Nobel
              Laureates in Polymer Chemistry symposium" and has responded enthusiastically. 
              The President of SPSJ, Professor Tisato Kajiama (Fukuoka University), will give
              opening remarks highlighting the close friendships and research collaborations
              of U.S. and Japanese polymer scientists.  Industrial participation in this
              symposium includes a talk by a research leader and session chairing by key
              industrial technology managers who are involved in transitioning basic research
              into conducting polymer and optoelectronic technologies.
