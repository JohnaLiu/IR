This award supports the participation of American scientists
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on primes and knots to be held at the Johns Hopkins
              University in Baltimore, Maryland from March 15-22, 2003.  The co-organizers
              are professors Jack Morava of the Johns Hopkins University and Professor
              Toshitake Kohno at the University of Tokyo in Japan.  The theory of primes and
              the theory of knots are perhaps the most venerated branches of algebra and of
              topology, and in many ways, they are both still the most accessible.  However,
              it is only relatively recently that researchers have begun to perceive deep
              relations between them, via analogies between the Galois groups of number
              fields and the fundamental groups of link complements.  

The topic has the
              advantage of being approachable from many directions and on many levels.  The
              theory of knots and the theory of primes are both intuitively accessible, and
              the participants expect this seminar to foster the development of a common
              language between researchers in these areas.  A prime resembles a knot, and the
              ideal generated by an algebraic integer is like the boundary of an embedded
              surface.  In both subjects, relations between abelian constructions such as
              Alexander invariants are relatively well-understood, and much current research
              centers on deeper nonabelian questions; for example, it is now known that {5,
              41, 61} is the first set of Borromean primes (in which no two are nontrivially
              linked, but all three are).   Seminar organizers have made a special effort to
              involve younger researchers and graduate students as both participants and
              observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field
              will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage
              for future collaborative projects.  Dissemination of information on the seminar
              will be available on the World Wide Web.
