Abstract    :
              0124271 Wyneken This award supports Jeanette Wyneken of Florida Atlantic
              University and primarily junior researchers from various U.S. universities to
              participate participation in an international symposium on turtle research in
              Jena, Germany.  The goals of the symposium include identifying important
              integrative directions in the field, exchanging ideas among experts with
              varying perspectives, facilitating contacts between those early in their
              careers and experienced researchers, and enhancing the opportunities for
              researchers on both sides of the Atlantic to engage in longer-term
              collaboration.
