Abstract    :
              0124922 Descour The aim of this project is the demonstration of an array of
              miniaturized microscope objectives. The area of immediate application is
              telepathology, a subspecialty of telemedicine that permits an expert
              pathologist at one location to provide diagnostic services to remote locations
              using digital video microscopy and modern telecommunications links. The goal of
              this SGER project is to explore the essential technical challenges associated
              with construction of an 80-microscope array In this project a sub-array of
              four, NA = 0.4 microscopes will be fabricated that will demonstrate a
              substantial imaging capability, i.e., imaging a 1-mm wide swath along the
              length of the slide. Image data will be recorded with 1-micron spatial
              resolution.  The long-term goal of the research is to construct an NA = 0.7,
              80-microscope array capable of  0.5-micron resolution over a 20-mm wide field
              of view. This SGER project will establish the technology foundations on which
              the NA = 0.7 microscope-array design will be based.
