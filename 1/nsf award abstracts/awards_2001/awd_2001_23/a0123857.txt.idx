Abstract    :
              Braslau 0123857  This is a three-year project submitted by Dr. Rebecca
              Braslau of the University of California at Santa Cruz, for establishing a
              Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site focusing on organic chemistry
              in Bangkok, Thailand.  This site will be an American Workforce and Research
              Education Program (AWARE)-REU site including the following collaborative
              institutes in Thailand:  Chulalongkorn University,Mahidol University, and
              Chulabhorn Research Institute.  The program will support a ten-week, summer
              international REU for 6-8 upper division U.S. undergraduates in Bangkok,
              Thailand.  The U.S. participants will be matched to research faculty at three
              of the Thailand's best universities and will be able to select from among
              research projects in supramoledular chemistry, novel organic polymers, natural
              product isolation and synthesis, bioorganic chemistry and synthethic organic
              chemistry methodology.  Thailand is an important country in Southeast Asia that
              few young Americans have a chance to visit.  Exposure to Thailand and its
              research establishsment and especially the personal relationships that result
              will constitute an extraordinary educational experience.  This presents a
              strong AWARE-REU opportunity.  This proposal addresses an important educational
              need in AWARE and could provide an excellent experience for U.S. undergraduates
              in chemistry.
