Abstract    :
              This Leadership Award is to recognize and support the role of Prof. Richmond
              in  increasing the participation and advancement of women in the chemical
              sciences through her leadership role in COACh. The funds will allow her to
              maintain her very active research program at the University of Oregon while
              providing her with more time to direct the COACh activities at a level
              appropriate for the demands and needs of women chemists, chemical engineers,
              and the chemical community in this country.   Over the past twenty years the
              number of women getting undergraduate degrees in chemistry, entering graduate
              school in chemistry and obtaining doctorate degrees in chemistry has been
              increasing. Women currently receive ca. 41% of the bachelor's degrees and
              almost one-third of the Ph.Ds granted in this field. Unfortunately, this
              increased number of women in the pipeline is not resulting in the significant
              changes in the chemical workforce that many had predicted. This is
              particularly noticeable in the academic workforce. Women make up approximately
              16% of chemistry faculty in four-year colleges and less than 10% of the
              chemistry faculty at doctoral granting institutions. Given the profound role
              of academic institutions in shaping the workforce in the chemical sciences and
              the expectations of future, efforts to enhance the numbers, success, and
              visibility of women chemists in academia are essential to improving the
              participation of women in the broader chemical sciences workforce. With the
              anticipated high turn-over in faculty positions in the coming decade, it is
              imperative that swift action be taken to assure that underrepresented groups
              are actively recruited and promoted into these vacated positions to produce a
              more balanced representation of gender and race in academia in the chemical
              sciences. COACh was developed in response to these concerns.   This project
              is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE
              Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and
              engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of
              women in academic science and engineering careers.
