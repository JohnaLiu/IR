Abstract    :
              The proposal focuses on the deployment and support of the NSF Middleware
              Initiative (NMI) and is designed to serve as the Service Provider for the NMI
              program.  The NMI program will expedite the development of middleware functions
              and services to support the national research and scientific community, and
              will also accelerate the deployment and use of new and emerging applications
              across the Internet.  The purpose of the NMI program is to enable members of
              the advanced networking community to collaborate in developing and assembling
              common network services and resources (middleware) to optimize the network for
              applications and to share limited resources for the common good of all
              users.  This proposal has three primary goals; - Provide production-quality
              software releases, support, training, and outreach, with the goals of ensuring
              that early adopter user communities are successful and that new user
              communities are trained in the use of the infrastructure.  - Leverage the
              PI's long history in running production facilities to develop tools and
              procedures to ensure that the resulting software is acceptable, deployable and
              supportable on a wide variety of end systems, including production environments
              at campus and laboratories.  - Provide dedicated operations capability
              providing 24x7 support for infrastructure elements, monitoring of grid
              infrastructure, and capture and analysis of grid usage data.  In doing so, NMI
              will enable the construction of a national scale infrastructure that can be
              used by application communities such as NEES and GriPhyN, or
              discipline-specific communities, or research communities, to explore the use of
              the middleware infrastructure on full scale, meaningful applications  The
              program will will  build on widely used research middleware, such as the Globus
              Toolkit, the de facto standard for Grid environments, Condor, and Storage
              Resource Broker, heavily leveraging open (e.g., IETF and W3C standard)
              protocols.  The results of the project will rely on open protocols and open
              source implementations. In undertaking these activities, NCSA will work closely
              with major U.S. projects including the NSF PACIs, which will help reach out to
              other user communities, and with UCAID, which has committed to working to
              address the challenging and important problem of integration with campus
              infrastructures and the larger education and research communities.  NCSA will
              work aggressively to support interoperability, transition relevant technologies
              to standards, and develop strong industrial relationships.
