Abstract    :
              Abstract  THERMES 2002 is a workshop/conference which will focus on the recent
              advances in thermal management and characterization schemes, as well as
              forecasts and analyses of future trends.  It is to be held in Santa Fe, New
              Mexico, in early 2002.  Thermal issues are key in electronic product
              development at all levels of the electronic product hierarchy, from the chip to
              the ultimate system. Shrinking system sizes are resulting in increasing
              volumetric heat generation rates and surface heat fluxes in many products.  In
              addition to the U.S. participants, a significant international participation
              from Europe and Asia is expected.  Invited talks in selected emerging areas
              will be complemented with contributed papers.  Panel discussions focusing on
              technology and market trends and identification of research challenges will be
              included.  The funds will help support travel for U.S. participants consisting
              of undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and non-tenured
              faculty with limited research funding.
