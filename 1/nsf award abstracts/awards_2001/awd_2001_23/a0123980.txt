Abstract    :
              A major trend in distributed computing is toward environments consisting of
              numerous wearable, handheld and embedded devices.  Rapid growth in inexpensive,
              short range, and low-power wireless communications and hardware, are now
              enabling experimentation with ubiquitous computing environments.  In order for
              ubiquitous environments to work well, it is essential that devices be able to
              detect their current context, that they must be aware of relationships between
              the users and the devices, and handle ad-hoc groups and their
              communications.

The proposal plans to take an integrated hardware and
              software approach to developing essential services to support a wide variety of
              distributed applications in heterogeneous environments.    The services include
              investigation of:
situation-aware inter-object communications
group
              management service to establish device communities
feasibility of using
              cellular automata computational model to design a scalable dissemination
              service
a service that will use the concept of context-sensitivity to perform
              trade-offs between transparent and QoS assisted adaptations.
The proposal will
              develop a Reconfigurable and Context-Sensitive Middleware, which will be
              open-source, open-schematic and open standard middleware based on top of
              Bluetooth standards.
