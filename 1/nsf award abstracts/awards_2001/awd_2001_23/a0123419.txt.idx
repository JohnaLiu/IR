Abstract    :
              This project will explore new connections between fundamental concepts in
              quantum theory, developed for use in nuclear physics, with areas of practical
              application in optical communication.  On the theoretical side, the proposal
              will extend recent research on three-dimensional topological solitons or
              "skyrmions".   Existing theories describe the electron either as a kind of pure
              point of infinite energy (which leads to many well-known mathematical problems)
              or as a vibration of a string or membrane in an 11-dimensional space (which
              leads to rather intractable computations). In nuclear physics, skyrmion models
              have made it possible to describe basic particles as stable whirlpools of force
              in three dimensions, whirlpools whose properties can be  computed and predicted
              more easily than those of vibrating strings. As part of this proposal, a
              leading expert in skyrmions will try to apply this approach to develop a new
              theory of how the electron behaves. The behavior of the electron is fundamental
              to all of electronics.                On the application side, the proposal
              will also use skyrmion mathematics and concepts to try to develop "optical
              bullets" for high-speed optical communications. Simpler one-dimensional soliton
              mathematics have been used already in optical communications, but the success
              so far - while significant - has been limited by the severe approximations used
              in that mathematics. It is hoped that the use of more complete and exact three-
              dimensional theory will lead to more powerful and more reliable design of new
              optical communication systems.  Furthermore, because optical experiments and
              technology depend on the details of the interaction between light and
              electrons, it is hoped that new experiments on these interactions, designed
              around the concept of skyrmion, will enrich both the applications side and the
              theoretical side, together.
