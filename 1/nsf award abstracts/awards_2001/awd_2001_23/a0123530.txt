Abstract    :
              This project will carry out an invitational conference for 35 U.S. and Russian
              experts in mathematics education, mathematics, materials development and
              psychology in late January, 2002.  The conference will determine the usefulness
              of the Elkonin-Davydov mathematics curriculum for the U.S.  The conference, a
              collaborative project of a non-profit organization with expertise in
              international education (Best Practices in Education) and the University of
              Hawaii's Curriculum Research and Development Group, is expected to be the first
              phase of a multi-year effort in curriculum analysis, materials development,
              field testing and professional development.  The project will investigate how
              the key features of the Russian (Elkonin-Davydov) curriculum, with its emphasis
              on mathematics as an integrated whole and its foundation in Russian research on
              mathematics learning, make it responsive to concerns that traditional U.S.
              curricula are fragmented and lack a sound basis in research.  The results of
              the project will be published by Information Age Publishing Company.
