Nisenson, Peter

This effort is to design, build, integrate and
              test a camera system to detect and characterize extra-solar planetary systems
              using a unique square aperture and dark speckle in the field.  Direct imaging
              is extremely difficult because of the large dynamic range required to separate
              out the scattered light from the parent star and the weak reflected light from
              a planetary object. The camera system will be used with the 900+ element
              adaptive optics system at the US Air Force Advanced Electro-Optical System
              telescope at Haleakela Hawaii for astronomical research.
