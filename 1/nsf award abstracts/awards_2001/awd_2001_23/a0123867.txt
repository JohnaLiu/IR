Abstract    :
              A newly acquired aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) will be deployed at the PROPHET
              (Program for Research on Oxidants: Photochemistry, Emissions, and Transport)
              site in Northern Michigan during the summer of 2001. The PI will attempt to
              measure deposition fluxes of individual species associated with aerosol
              particles. The size-segregated ambient aerosol composition will be measured at
              a fast rate, including the ions sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium. Fluxes will be
              determined using the eddy correlation method. This project is supported as a
              Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) and is a collaboration with
              Aerodyne Research Inc., the manufacturers of the AMS instruments.
