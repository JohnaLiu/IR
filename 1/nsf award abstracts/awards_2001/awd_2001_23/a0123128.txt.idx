Abstract    :
               This program provides scholarships for students pursuing degrees in
              mathematics, electrical engineering technology, mechanical engineering
              technology, pre-engineering, and computer science. Technology Scholars are
              supported through a series of orientations, seminars, mentoring activities,
              internships, and other special events to ensure that they persist in their
              educational and career goals. Scholars develop experiential knowledge of job
              prospects in high technology fields and establish valuable connections with
              other professionals, prospective employers, and higher education
              representatives. Scholars maintain an on-line personal growth portfolio that
              is monitored by faculty advisors.
