Abstract    :
              The PIs propose to educate women geoscientists on the barriers to their progress
              in academia
and on strategies to overcome those barriers. Their goal is to
              increase the proportion of women in
geoscience tenure track and tenured
              positions in academia in the United States.

Project objectives are to:
1)
              determine the current status of women in academia through a survey of
              geoscience
departments in the United States,
2) conduct focus groups and
              surveys of students, tenured and untenured faculty and non-tenure
track
              faculty at national geoscience meetings to determine what is the perception of
              barriers
to women's progress in the field,
3) hold a 1-day workshop to
              investigate the causes of the low representation of women in
academic
              geoscience positions in the United States, and
4) Disseminate the information
              to geoscience students, junior faculty and to academic
administrators to
              educate women students and faculty on strategies to overcome
              barriers,
encourage women to pursue academic geoscience careers and teach
              administrators how to
recruit and retain qualified women in geoscience.
This
              approach to increasing women's representation in the geosciences takes a
              'supply-side' or mentoring approach, with a focus on teaching women what they
              need to
know to become (i) educated in the field without discrimination, (ii)
              to negotiate salaries and
contracts, and (iii) to find out what is required to
              achieve tenure at their institutions.

This project is supported by the NSF
              ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the
              participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the
              increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and
              engineering careers.
