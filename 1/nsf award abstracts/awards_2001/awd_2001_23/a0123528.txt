Abstract    :
              The demand for patent-based indicators has been growing steadily over the past
              decades, both for macro and micro-economic analysis as well as for policy use,
              as reflected in national S&T statistical publications like the NSF's Science
              and Engineering Indicators and the European Commission's Report on European S&T
              Indicators.  To address a lack of a common database designed to construct
              internationally comparable patent indicators, the Organisation for Economic
              Cooperation and Development (OECD) will conduct a project that will construct a
              database and supporting methodology that will be accessible to Member
              governments.  This work consists of three broad modules:  constructing the
              database, developing an internationally agreed upon methodology and organizing
              a workshop where a variety of users, data providers, and analysts can
              contribute to the project.  Major output of the project are:  (1) a database
              available to all participants in the project, regularly updated; (2) guidelines
              for calculating indicators:  published as working papers, they will feed into a
              revised version of the OECD Patents manual; (3) indicators published on a
              regular basis by the OECD and made available to institutions such as the NSF in
              OECD member countries; (4) an international workshop in 2002 on patents
              indicators, with participation of experts from the institutions supporting the
              project; and (5) a compendium of patent statistics published in 2002,
              collecting new indicators, an analysis of technological trends drawn from these
              indicators, and methodological explanations.
