Abstract    :
              This project is for The American Mathematical Society to administer a program
              for selecting approximately 130 U.S. mathematicians for whom travel awards of
              about $2000 each will be provided to attend the International Congress of
              Mathematicians in Beijing, China, August 20-28, 2002 (ICM-02).  

Held every
              four years, the International Congress of Mathematicians is one of the most
              important gatherings of the world's leading mathematicians, where major
              mathematical developments across subdisciplines are discussed.  The Congress
              promotes cross-fertilization among the different subcommunities of the
              mathematical world. Significant U.S. representation at ICM-02 is important to
              the scientific health of the nation.

Applications will be evaluated by a
              panel of professional mathematicians, who use their judgment both in evaluating
              professional qualifications and guaranteeing that early career and minority
              applicants are not overlooked.  The awards are intended to cover travel, and a
              portion of subsistence or registration fee coverage, except in the case of
              early career mathematicians, who will be awarded more subsistence.  The AMS
              administered similar programs for ICM-90 in Kyoto, Japan, ICM-94 in Zurich,
              Switzerland and ICM-98 in Berlin, Germany.
