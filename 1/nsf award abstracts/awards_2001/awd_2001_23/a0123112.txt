Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

The project would work with teachers who are involved in the RSI
              reform.  It would provide professional development opportunities to the
              teachers in the RSI schools, and would develop a sustainable leadership
              component for the central Appalachian region.  These activities are strongly
              aligned with the goals of the RSI project.  The professional development
              offered to teachers would be heavily content-oriented, with some pedagogical
              training.
