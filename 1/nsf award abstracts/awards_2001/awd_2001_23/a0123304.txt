Graham, James R.

The solar neighborhood within 50 parsecs will
              be examined for spectral type L and T dwarf companions using the adaptive
              optics system at the Advanced Electro-Optical System telescope on Haleakela,
              Maui Hawaii.   Late-type binaries of low magnitude contrast will be examined to
              search for these companions.  So few of these stars are known to exist today
              using classical techniques of observation, that discovery of new ones, which
              may result from the application of adaptive optics, will have a profound effect
              on our understanding of these objects.
