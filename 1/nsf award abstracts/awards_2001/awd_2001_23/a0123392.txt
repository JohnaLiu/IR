Abstract    :
              A two-year, systematic observational study of the seasonal variations in
              mid-latitude metal layer dynamics is proposed at the Arecibo Observatory.  The
              occurrence and behavior of various metal layers (Na, Fe, K, Ca) will be
              investigated using the Arecibo lidars and the incoherent scatter radar during
              summer, winter and equinox periods.  Such a study will provide a comprehensive
              view of metal layer dynamics as a function of season allowing us to explore the
              coupling between neutral dynamics, chemistry and the plasma.  Past studies at
              Arecibo have concentrated on case studies of metal species at particular times
              of year, but the PI proposes a systematic year-round study utilizing the
              complete capabilities of the Arecibo lidars.  In addition, observations during
              summer Es maximum coupled with observations at other times of year will provide
              insight into the relationship between metal layer dynamics and the formation of
              Es and associated plasma irregularities.  Past observations at Arecibo have
              shown that sporadic ionization layers are often associated with sporadic metal
              layers, such as sodium, but the relationship between such layers when
              instabilities are present has not been explored in detail.  The proposed study
              represents an exciting opportunity to establish a baseline for the
              understanding of metal layer morphology and dynamics at mid-latitudes.  It will
              also produce important insights into Es formation and associated
              irregularities.
