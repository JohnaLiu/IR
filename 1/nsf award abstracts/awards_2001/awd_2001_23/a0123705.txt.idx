Abstract    :
               The proposal is a collaborative proposal involving University of Pittsburgh &
              Case Western Reserve University.  The proposal plans to explore fundamental
              questions and associated middleware development issues to support broadcast and
              multicast data dissemination.  When many people try to access the same
              information (for example, news sites during the Election),  servers are often
              overwhelmed resulting in long delays.  If an effective multicast capability
              existed across the Internet, a single server could have served all the
              requests, saving both computer power as well as reducing the amount of overall
              Internet traffic.    The approach will highlight gaps in the state-of-the-art
              and will research and explore new techniques and algorithms.  The objectives
              include 1. transparently provide applications with data management services
              such as caching, scheduling and consistency maintenance,  2. improve internet
              functionality, performance, and cost-effectiveness, and 3. reduce the
              application development time while improving performance and
              reliability.  The proposal plans to make the information and developed
              software available to
