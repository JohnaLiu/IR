Abstract    :
               A minimum of 29 low-income, academically talented students pursuing
              baccalaureate degrees in computer science and computer technology are receiving
              scholarship awards of up to $3125 per academic year. These awards are allowing
              these students to pursue their education on a full-time instead of part-time
              basis.
A host of support activities including tutoring and study-skills
              programs, an honors program, personal and financial counseling, and a full
              range of cooperative education and career services are available to the
              students. Each scholarship receipent is assigned a faculty mentor who maintains
              a portfolio on the student's progress.
