Abstract    :
              A number of opportunities exist for COLLEGE OF MENOMINEE NATION that require
              further  development of SMET programs currently offered at the College. To
              forward its 8,000  years of stewardship and expertise in sustainable forest
              management, the Menominee Nation is committed to ensuring that future
              generations are prepared as stewards  well-schooled in sound sciences and best
              practices in Menominee autochthony. Our challenge is to assure that quality in
              SMET education is commensurate with that  stewardship.  COLLEGE OF MENOMINEE
              NATION will enhance student opportunities in science, math, engineering and
              technology through a planning process that will provide assessment  of the
              SMET infrastructure and the development of an institutional plan to enhance
              its SMET program.  The process will also assess the needs of the communities
              on the  Menominee Reservation, as well as the Oneida, Mohican and Potowatomi
              Nations and  neighboring non-Indian communities to determine the constellation
              of SMET programs that will promote sustainable development in the communities
              of northeastern  Wisconsin.  In addition, assessment of the current math
              offerings as a necessary interface is a priority.  We envision such an
              analysis as the key to our delivery  of student research opportunities in
              eco-toxicology, environmental science and  environmental health.
