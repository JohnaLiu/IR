Project Abstract
This project provides 40 scholarships to talented
              low-income students majoring in computer science and engineering. The program
              called the Collaborative Interdisciplinary Research Community (CIRC) Scholars
              Program, includes a CIRC Academic Enrichment Program and the Research
              Orientation Workshops (ROW) Program. This project enables ASU to recruit and to
              retain high quality students with financial need who, without this support,
              might not be able to continue their education on a full time basis. The focus
              of the recruitment is on students of junior or higher standing and transfer
              students, but also includes some sophomores and some graduate students with
              special financial needs. Underrepresented minority students in computer science
              and engineering (African American, Hispanic, Native American, and women) are
              especially recruited for these scholarships. 

The College of Engineering and
              Applied Sciences (CEAS) at ASU has a well, established infrastructure to
              support the project. Key to the support of the scholars, is the requirement to
              participate in an Academic Enrichment Program that includes workshops on study
              skills and close mentoring and monitoring by ASU staff and faculty, as well as
              the Research Orientation Workshops (ROW) Program, which concentrates on
              research and graduate school. Scholars are also offered the opportunity to
              participate in one of ASU's high profile research groups in the CEAS.
