Abstract    :
              This program provides financial and academic support for students at the
              upper-level sophomore, junior and senior level who possess the potential to
              graduate with a baccalaureate degree with majors in computer science,
              engineering, engineering technology, and mathematics. The program strives to
              attract underrepresented individuals into these disciplines. Academic support
              structures include close faculty advising, professional development events, and
              internships and career positions through an industrial advisory board.
