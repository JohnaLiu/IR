Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to contribute to the development of a national
              science and engineering academic workforce that includes the full participation
              of women in all levels of faculty and academic administration, particularly at
              the senior academic ranks, through the transformation of institutional
              practices, policies, climate and culture.  The Unviersity of Puerto Rico,
              Hamacao proposes to implement a five year program to increase the participation
              and advancement of women in the natural and social sciences.  The University of
              Puerto Rico (UPR), Humacao Campus is an undergraduate institution with
              approximately 4,300 students; 99% of Puerto Rican origin and 65% women. For
              years UPR has had one of the highest rates of recruitment and graduation of
              undergraduate women in science, mathematics, and engineering in the United
              States. At the Humacao campus, 68% of the students in the Biology and Chemistry
              programs and 50% in Mathematics are women. In Physics, the only program with a
              minority of women the number has increased to 26% after the efforts of the last
              7 years. Although the number of women in science is high compared to
              universities in the US mainland, women are still underrepresented in the
              faculty and do not advance to the highest academic ranks at the same rate of
              male faculty.   The proposed project includes the following activities:
               Investigate the causes and consequences of the participation of women in
              science in the UPR-Humacao to develop strategies that can be used in UPR and
              elsewhere. Identify problems that inhibit the advancement of women faculty and
              determine how they might differ between universities in Puerto Rico and other
              US universities.  Set-up a coordinated campus effort to revise procedures, and
              to define and implement policies and practices for the recruitment, retention
              and advancement of faculty to increase the participation and advancement of
              women faculty. Set-up training for new faculty on career transitions,
              including on gender related issues and how to advance in academic
              positions.. Set-up training for administrators on approaches to improving
              gender equality and diversity. Increase the recruitment of women in Physics
              and Electronics and Computational Mathematics by providing scholarships for
              graduate studies (with funds from UPR-H) to talented students.  UPR-H will
              carry out an assessment and evaluation program on the proposed activities
              throughout the project to develop short and longterm interventions, and to
              measure the  effectiveness of the proposed approach.  The program will serve as
              a model for other Hispanic universities, both in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in
              the US.  This project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall
              mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the
              scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and
              advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers.
