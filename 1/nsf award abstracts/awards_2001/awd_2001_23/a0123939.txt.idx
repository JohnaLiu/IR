Abstract    :
               	The convergence of telecommunications networks rely heavily on the
              interconnection of networks and related Quality of Service (QoS).  The Internet
              is evolving into a multi-class service, integrated network, which is trying to
              support various applications, which require QoS in addition to the traditional
              best-effort applications.    The goal of the proposal is to design, evaluate,
              develop and test new dynamic Quality of Service and bandwidth management
              mechanisms and systems that allow secure and scalable dynamic open provisioning
              for the interconnection of Differentiated services.  The proposal will develop
              a Bandwidth Management Point to manage scalable and secure control, and
              performs the functions of service assignment, admission control, traffic
              conditioning and class routing.  The Bandwidth Management Point will support
              intra-domain communications, which is useful for applications within the same
              domain.  It will also support inter-domain applications including policy
              information such as reservation process, edge-to-edge admission control and
              peer-to-peer access control.  The deliverables include the design, analysis and
              implementation of software.
