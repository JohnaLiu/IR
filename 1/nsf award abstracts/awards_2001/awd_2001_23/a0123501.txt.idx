Abstract    :
              This proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation NSF 01-65 on
              "Ultra-High Capacity Optical Communications and Networking." The present
              state-of-the-art in wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), ~100 signal
              transmission channels in the fiber C-band (1525-1565 nm), employs only a small
              fraction of available fiber bandwidth. While erbium-doped fiber amplifiers
              (EDFAs) for the L-band (1565-1605 nm) are presently being developed and
              deployed, there is a widely-recognized need to develop systems for other
              portions of silica glass fiber's low-loss transmission "spectral window"
              (1200-1700 nm). Present C-band systems utilize various approaches for hybrid
              integration of both active InP-based optoelectronic devices (photon laser
              sources, amplifiers, and detectors) and passive InP or silica-on-silicon planar
              lightwave circuits (or PLCs, for multiplexing, demultiplexing, and add/drop
              functions). Greater functional and/or monolithic integration of the active and
              passive components used in WDM systems will reduce their costs and accelerate
              deployment.  Researchers have recently demonstrated GalnNAs quantum well
              heterostructure semiconductor lasers operating at 1310 nm (cw, 300 K) and 1520
              nm (pulsed, 300 K). These devices overcome the performance limitations inherent
              to lnP-based heterostructures due to weak carrier confinement by low potential
              barriers. This exciting development also has enabled GaAs-based
              heterostructures to access optical fiber communication system wavelengths for
              the first time. The potential for complex lightwave circuitry with monolithic
              integration of active and passive components for optical communications is much
              greater than exists in the InP material system due to the much larger range of
              material parameters afforded by GaAs-based 111-V alloys. In particular, the
              compatibility with A1GaAs and InAlP alloys, which can be converted through wet
              thermal oxidation to insulating and transparent low refractive index oxides,
              provides a significant advantage for advanced waveguide integration
              techniques.  In this project, the development of new approaches for the
              fabrication of GaAs-based photonic integrated circuits for WDM applications in
              optical communications will be explored. Wet thermal oxidation of A1GaAs and
              InA1P alloys will be applied to low-loss waveguide fabrication for both active
              and passive waveguide devices. Novel structure designs and processing
              approaches will be combined to realize fully-oxidized A1GaAs heterostructures
              as broadband passive ridge waveguides for monolithic integration with active
              components. Rare-earth doping of native oxide waveguides will be explored using
              both Pr3+- and Er3+-doping for 1.3 um and 1.55 um band amplifiers,
              respectively. Phased-array (PHASAR) based WDM devices will be designed,
              fabricated and characterized in native-oxide based waveguides. This will lead
              to curriculum enhancement in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the
              University of Notre Dame.
