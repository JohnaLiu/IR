Smith, Ian

A sensitive CCD camera system to enable imaging
              photometry, spectroscopy and polarimetry of the out burst and the following
              brightness decay of Gamma Ray Bursters will be designed, fabricated, assembled,
              aligned, tested, integrated and calibrated. In year 1 of this proposal the
              instrument will be located at the Coude room of the Air Force Advanced
              Electro-Optical System (AEOS) on Haleakela Hawaii. During year 2 the instrument
              will be mounted on the trunion axle of the alt-azimuth mount of the telescope.
              The instrument's operation will be documented to the extent that Air Force
              instruments scientists in residence on Maui will maintain the routine operation
              of the instrument.
