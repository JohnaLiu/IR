This award supports travel of eleven US participants,
              including junior researchers, to a transatlantic workshop, "Electronic Networks
              and Democratic Life."  The organizers are Teresa Harrison of Rensselaer
              Polytechnic Institute and Nicholas Jankowski of the University of Nijmegen, The
              Netherlands.  The objective of the workshop is to articulate major research
              questions that will establish research priorities, generate collaborative
              projects, and lay the basis for comparative studies. Specifically, the workshop
              will address relationships between system characteristics and user behaviors,
              uses of new technologies for political and government action, and the nature
              and consequences of online civic discourse.   The goal of the workshop is the
              development of an international research community participating in
              collaborative research projects on e-networks and democratic life.
