Abstract    :
              Howard Community College (HCC) in Columbia, Maryland is providing twenty-five
              (25) scholarships for full-time, financially eligible students majoring in
              computer science, computer support technology,
engineering, and mathematics.
              These scholarships expand enrollment by reducing economic
barriers to
              increased student retention and articulation. The project provides a
              challenging and supportive program that prepares them for engineering, computer
              science, computer technology or mathematics at four-year colleges or
              universities. Retention and success in the program involves program advising
              and counseling, a strong focus on assessing and developing the skills necessary
              for their success, tutoring and study groups, a Learning community support from
              peers. The graduates of this program are available to help alleviate the
              shortage of trained personnel needed by the high technology industries
              located
in central Maryland.
