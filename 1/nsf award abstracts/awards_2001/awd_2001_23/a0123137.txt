Abstract    :
              
The scholarship program is structured to support 32 minority and/or female
              student participants.
Scholars are selected from students who have or will
              receive associate degrees in science
and technology from appropriate programs
              and who express intent to major in one of the
CSEMS disciplines. Students are
              recruited primarily, but not exclusively, from the
local/state community
              college(s) participating in articulation agreement(s) with
              Southern
University. Scholars are selected based on financial need and
              academic achievement.
Students are co-advised by academic mentors. They
              participate in structured mentoring programs and various student development
              seminars/workshops, register with the SU Career Services Office, and
              participate in Career Services-offered career workshops.
The scholarship
              program helps improve retention rates for capable
students citing financial
              difficulties as reasons not to complete bachelor's degrees in CSEMS
fields.
              Retention will also improve due to better preparedness of students having
              received
needed remedial instruction before they come to the four-year
              college.
