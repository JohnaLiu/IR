Abstract    :
              The problem of under-representation of women in engineering and sciences is
              critical.
This is particularly true of senior women in engineering. To address
              this urgent problem
of under-representation and to meet the marketplace demand
              for the technological
workforce in the 21 st century, a program is proposed
              that provides for mentoring and
leadership development.
 
The aim of the
              Mentoring and Leadership Program is to sustain and broaden the
              existing
initiatives at Syracuse University to promote the advancement of
              women faculty in
engineering and sciences. Some of the existing initiatives
              are the brainchild of WISE,
which the PI co-directs with the Dean of the
              College of Arts and Sciences, and others
are the direct results of the PI's
              Meredith Professorship initiatives. The proposed
Mentoring and Leadership
              Program will capitalize on the existing initiatives and will 
introduce new
              features that reflect current knowledge of leadership development. 

The
              ADVANCE Leadership Award will also enable the PI to maintain an
              active
research program while she develops and implements initiatives aimed at
              the
advancement of women students and faculty at Syracuse University.
This
              project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the
              ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and
              engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of
              women in academic science and engineering careers.
