Abstract    :
              Project Summary


Thirty-two academically talented low-income students
              majoring in computer science or mathematics fields are receiving scholarships
              enabling them to complete the degree requirements in a timely fashion. In
              addition to the scholarships they receive enhanced faculty mentoring, increased
              availability of no cost tutoring, cooperative study groups, and monthly
              gatherings combining discipline and social activities. Limited funds are also
              available to support student attendance at professional meetings for
              undergraduates.
