The Advanced Electro-Optical System (AEOS) on
              Haleakela, Maui, Hawaii of the US Air Force with its adaptive optics system
              will be used to determine the density as a function of altitude and the
              structure of the atmosphere of the satellite of Saturn: Titan.  The
              observational plan is to observe a stellar occultation and measure intensity
              and spatial distribution as the light from a background star passes (refracts)
              through the atmosphere of Titan.  The A/O system has been shown to lock-up and
              correct wavefront errors using Titan as the source.
