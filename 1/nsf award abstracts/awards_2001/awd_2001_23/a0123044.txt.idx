Abstract    :
              The R-Cubed program is providing scholarships of $3,125 each to computer
              science, engineering, and mathematics majors who have demonstrated financial
              need and academic potential. Preference for scholarships is given to women and
              American Indians. Professional presentations, meetings, and social functions
              all facilitate academic and social development of the R-Cubed scholars. The
              program also helps the department to serve the people of Montana as the state's
              economy shifts away from one dependent on natural resources. Success of the
              program in achieving retention and recruitment objectives is systematically
              evaluated and reported by a professional evaluator.
