Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to explore ways of integrating forefront research
              into undergraduate education. The PI is creating a collaborative environment in
              which research faculty scholars at universities translate their cutting-edge
              scientific research into meaningful undergraduate educational experiences.
              Participating faculty have a) free access to the PI's open source core software
              tools, which ease the development of new software, b) a full set of
              assessment-based curriculum development frameworks based on the PI's prior
              education efforts, c) access to the education and research staff of the PI and
              collaborating institutions, and d) web-based community support. The PI is also
              developing collaborations with teaching faculty scholars from 2- and 4-year
              colleges and community colleges to facilitate the introduction of
              research-based educational materials into their science courses and encourage
              science research opportunities for undergraduates. Participating faculty have
              a) free access to all educational technologies developed through prior and
              concurrent development collaborations, b) free access to assessment-based
              curriculum activities, c) an ongoing collaboration with a research university
              and the research staff of the PI and collaborators, and d) Web-based community
              support.
