Abstract    :
              This three year effort will investigate the mesospheric effects of gravity waves
              generated by strong convection activity in large area multicell thunderstorms
              at tropospheric altitudes.  Due to their large sizes, the multicell
              thunderstorms cannot be treated as point sources and require generalization of
              the existing gravity wave theory for cylindrical, aperture type, sources with
              inclusion of the resultant diffraction effects.  The purpose of the project is
              to undertake a systematic and focused study of mesospheric effects of two and
              three dimensional fully nonlinear numerical models.

The outstanding
              scientific questions which motivate this research program are (1) What is the
              dynamics of mesospheric cylindrical gravity waves generated by distributed
              convective sources at tropospheric altitudes?  (2) What are effects of the
              convectively generated cylindrical gravity waves on mesospheric heating rates,
              wind profiles, and density perturbations?  In order to answer these questions,
              the PI will develop and apply two and three dimensional, fully non-linear,
              compressible models of gravity waves launched upward by distributed convective
              sources at tropospheric altitudes.  These models will be solving a standard set
              of equations expressing conservation of mass, momentum and energy, and will
              account for realistic convective properties of tropospheric thunderstorms as
              well as realistic parameters of the ambient atmosphere (i.e., temperature,
              Brunt-Vaisala frequency, and wind profiles).
