Abstract    :
              The purpose of this planning grant is to conduct an assessment of Dull Knife
              Memorial College's SMET curriculum and infrastructure in order to develop an
              institutional SMET action plan that will be used as the basis for a full TCUP
              grant to be submitted by May 2002. In addition, the College will develop
              assessment instruments to determine the effectiveness of its
              SMET instructional programs and to develop a system to track SMET
              graduates that transfer to 4-year colleges and universities. The planning
              period will be for 12 months and will include three phases: Phase 1 (October
              1, 2001 - December 15, 2001) assessment of SMET infrastructure. Phase 2
              (January 1, 2002 - May 1, 2002) development of institutional plan and full
              TCUP proposal. Phase 3 (August 15, 2002 - September 30, 2002) development
              of assessment instruments. By the end of the grant period Dull Knife will
              have developed an assessment of its SMET programs, developed an institutional
              plan to enhance its SMET program, submitted a full TCUP grant,
              developed instruments to evaluate its SMET courses, and developed a student
              tracking system.
