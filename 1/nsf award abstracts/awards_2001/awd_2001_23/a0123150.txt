Abstract    :
              This award supports the United States' contribution to the Past Global Changes
              (PAGES) International Project Office (IPO) in Bern, Switzerland.  PAGES is one
              of several scientific programs that operates under the broad umbrella of the
              International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP). 

Operated as a
              partnership between the US National Science Foundation and the Swiss National
              Science Foundation, the PAGES program has enabled the collaboration of
              international teams of scientists and students from developed and developing
              nations on projects searching for answers to critical questions in paleoclimate
              science.  The specific responsibilities of the IPO include organizing meetings
              and workshops, publishing peer-reviewed manuscripts and books, producing
              newsletters, and maintaining and facilitating contacts among international
              scientists.

The scientific data generated by PAGES-coordinated research
              projects are readily available through various publicly accessible databases
              including those of the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) in Boulder,
              Colorado operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  In
              addition, PAGES actively seeks participation in research projects by scientists
              in developing countries thereby enabling technological transfer and capacity
              building within the scientific community.
