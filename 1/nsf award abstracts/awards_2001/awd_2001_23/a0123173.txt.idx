Abstract    :
               The 21st Century Scholars Program is providing scholarships for students
              studying in the areas of computer science, mathematics and engineering (CSEM).
              This important program provides a vital link between the workforce needs of
              Danville's employers and a pool of potential employees in need of the resources
              to gain vital skills. Objectives are to (a) provide financial assistance for
              students to earn an associate's degree in a CSEM field and (b) allow area
              residents to prepare for jobs in the areas that impact the local economy.
