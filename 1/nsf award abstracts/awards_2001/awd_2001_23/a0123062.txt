Abstract    :
              Twenty nine scholarships in the amount of $3125 are available annually to
              academically talented, low-income students majoring in computer science or
              mathematics. Several strategies are used to ease the transition from high
              school to college helping to ensure student achievement and success. These
              strategies include small class sizes, an emphasis on collaborative learning, a
              student mentorship program, internship
opportunities with local business and
              industry, and active student organizations focused on professional development
              in computer science and mathematics. The program is resulting in increased
              numbers of students electing to major in the targeted disciplines.
