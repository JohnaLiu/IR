Roggemann, Michael C.

This work will develop and validate a
              technique to derive long exposure Point Spread Functions as a function of Field
              of View using on-axis wavefront statistics measured at the Advanced
              Electro-Optical System adaptive optics wavefront sensor. The technique will use
              existing models of the well-characterized turbulence profiles at the Maui site
              on Haleakela.  This approach, if demonstrated successfully, may lead to a new
              technique that will be an alternative to the more expensive and complex
              Multiple Conjugate Adaptive Optics systems planned for the future.   It
              promises to be a useful tool for the entire astronomy community studying
              extended objects.
