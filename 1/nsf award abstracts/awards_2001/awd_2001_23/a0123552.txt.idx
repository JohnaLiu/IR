Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to contribute to the development of a national
              science and engineering academic workforce that includes the full participation
              of women in all levels of faculty and academic administration, particularly at
              the senior academic ranks, through the transformation of institutional
              practices, policies, climate and culture. The University of Washington (UW)
              recognizes the important contributions that women make in science, engineering,
              and mathematics (SEM), and the factors that still inhibit women's full
              participation. The University proposes to create the Center for Institutional
              Change (CIC) to design and implement programs to help eliminate obstacles to
              women's full participation and advancement  in the SEM disciplines.  Many of
              these challenges occur in departments, so changing departmental culture will be
              a part of the CIC mission.    The CIC will focus on these issues in SEM on
              campus:  Leadership development for chairs and deans  Department cultural
              change Policy change Leadership development  Short-term support program for
              faculty in times of transition   The work of the CIC will seve all groups
              (men, women, underrepresented) and improve the environment for everyone in SEM.
               UW will share its experiences with other institutions, professional societies,
              and industrial partners that are addressing the issues of low representation of
              women faculty in engineering and science.  A network will be established to
              facilitate dissemination, and UW will work with Boeing, Weyerhaeuser, CH2M
              Hill, and REI to share best practices.  This project is supported by the NSF
              ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the
              participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the
              increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and
              engineering careers.
