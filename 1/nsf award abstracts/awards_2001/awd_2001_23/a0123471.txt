The Advanced Electro-Optical System (AEOS) on
              Haleakela, Maui, Hawaii of the US Air Force with its adaptive optics system and
              the standard imaging focal plane will be used to study the visible and infrared
              character of the atmospheres of Mars, Saturn and Jupiter.  The Mars
              observations monitor inter-annual variations of the Martian surface albino and
              its relation to global dust storms.  The observations of Jupiter and Saturn
              monitor the location and properties of aerosols in their atmospheres. The
              unique capabilities of this telescope system enable the recording of very high
              spatial resolution images of the planets.  These high resolutions approaching
              20 milliarc seconds are essential to observe motions of clouds across the
              surface disk of the planet.
