Abstract    :
              McBay  OIA-0123262  Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, a
              non-profit organization, has been instrumental in improving the education of
              under-represented groups that have been historically undeserved by the nation's
              educational system.  A successor to the Quality Education for Minorities
              Project based at MIT, QEM continues to develop effective strategies of SMET
              education for minorities, and focuses on issues and barriers that prevent
              minorities for receiving a high quality education.  In order for minority
              serving institutions to offer competitive research and research training
              programs in the sciences, faculty and students must have access to
              state-of-the-art instrumentation to enable them to conduct high quality
              research. This award to QEM will make it possible to provide technical
              assistance to minority -serving institutions; equipping faculty with the
              essential tools needed develop competitive instrumentation proposals to NSF's
              equipment programs, including the Major Research Instrumentation Program.  As a
              result all US institutions will have opportunity to secure funds needed to
              facilitate their efforts in the quest to unravel the challenges presented by
              the universe.
