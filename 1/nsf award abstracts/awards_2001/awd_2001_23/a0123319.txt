Abstract    :
              Mentor Net is an innovative program that uses the Internet as a vehicle to do
              large-scale mentoring, especially of women. During the 2000-2001 program year,
              two thousand students were matched with one thousand nine hundred and thirteen
              mentors representing six hundred and ninety companies; seventy affiliated
              colleges and universities participated. The large network of mentors from
              industry and government laboratories it has developed provide those mentored
              with a better understanding of a field, occupation, or organization, including
              cultural factors, typical professional and personal rewards, likely challenges,
              and strategies for success. 

 This program is particularly beneficial in its
              support of undergraduate and graduate women students who are currently enrolled
              in engineering or science programs in higher education. The program is
              successful in the retention of women in mathematics, science, and engineering
              majors and careers. Involving a large and increasing number of diverse
              companies is a key benefit. There is also a strong emphasis on the evaluation
              of the program, which works to continually improve the MentorNet operation, and
              also documents the program's impressive statistics in supporting the retention
              of diverse students in science, engineering, and technology. The training and
              feedback mechanism for mentors makes this program even more effective, ensuring
              that the mentors know how to interact with the students successfully.
