This project supports the travel of U.S. academic researchers
              to attend the fifth in a
series of major international symposia on bulk power
              systems dynamics and control. This
particular symposium will be held in
              Onomichi City, Japan on August 26-31, 2001 and will
focus on "Security and
              Reliability in a changing environment". The purpose of this
project is to
              stimulate participation by U.S. faculty and students by providing a portion
of
              their travel expenses.
