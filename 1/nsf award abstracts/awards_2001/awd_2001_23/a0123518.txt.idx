Abstract    :
                   It has long been a comfortable fallacy that the optical fiber has infinite
              bandwidth, and, therefore, we have bandwidth to burn. With the explosion of
              multiple-channel communications through the
              use wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM), available bandwidth now takes
              center stage. When comparing optical communications with other types of
              communications, we lag far behind in terms of spectral efficiency (i.e.,
              bits/Hz) and we are not even close to the Shannon capacity limit. In fact,
              higher spectral efficiency is probably the area of least creative activity
              within the field, and yet it holds the promise for revolutionary increases in
              future systems capacity.      One of the technical areas within optical
              communications that has shown the most bandwidth waste and has many future
              potential applications is subcarrier multiplexing (SCM) of many
              lower-speed channels on a single wavelength carrier. In SCM, half the data
              bandwidth is wasted since either: (i) transmitting double-sideband signals
              will, in essence, duplicate the data being sent given that each sideband
              carries the full information needed for reception, or (ii) transmitting
              single-sideband signals requires that the mirror frequencies on the other side
              of the carrier wave (i.e., where the second sideband would have been located)
              remain unoccupied by any other data signals.      Subcarrier multiplexing has
              many advantages for future optical communications systems, including: (a) the
              transmission of many lower-speed digital data signals on a single
              high-capacity wavelength, (b) the transmission of many analog-modulated
              signals, (c) the transmission medium for networks that accommodate wireless
              microwave-based optical signals, and (d) the transmission of control labels
              for efficient routing in packet-switched networks.      We propose
              implementing a new multiplexing scheme that enables double the spectral
              efficiency for optical systems that use subcarrier multiplexing. The scheme is
              called dispersion-division-multiplexing (DDM) and relies on placing two data
              channels simultaneously in the same frequency space away from an optical
              carrrier. For example, one double-sideband data channel is
              transmitted conventionally, and a second double-sideband channel is
              transmitted in the shadow of the first channel. Shadowing occurs due to the
              chromatic dispersion of the optical fiber. Due to dispersion, each of the two
              double sidebands of a single channel will travel at slightly different speeds.
              These sidebands will periodically be out-of-phase will each other relative to
              the optical carrier wave, thereby canceling each other and inducing RF power
              fading (i.e., a nearly complete disappearing of the given channel's power at a
              receiver). One channel would be faded when the other channel would be in-phase
              and have full power. By using a tunable dispersion-inducing element, a
              receiver can change the relative phase between each cannel's two sidebands and
              thus recover either of the two frequency-co-located channels.      Our
              research program will investigate unique functionalities, opportunities, and
              limitations when using spectrally-efficient dispersion-division-multiplexing
              that could bear significant fruit in the 5-10 year time frame. The key
              fundamental features of our systems and networking research program are
              as follows. We will: (a) demonstrate highly-spectrally-efficient DDM for many
              WDM channels, (b) demonstrate the utility of DDM for interconnecting nodes in
              a wireless-based photonic network, (c) demonstrate SCM label swapping and
              routing in a WDM photonic network, and (d) investigate the fundamental
              limitations of generating, transmitting, and receiving DDM channels when
              considering SNR, extinction ratio, and data bandwidth. TABLE OF CONTENTS
