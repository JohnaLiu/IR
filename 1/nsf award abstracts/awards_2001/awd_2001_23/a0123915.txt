This Americas Program proposal requests support to Dr. Gary
              S. Hartshorn of Duke University for sponsorship of eight undergraduate students
              to participate in a research-oriented tropical biology program in Costa
              Rica.

The goal of this project, to be conducted in collaboration with the
              Organization of Tropical Studies in Costa Rica, is to provide field oriented
              research opportunities for the students. Costa Rica's richness of ecosystems
              and biodiversity will provide the students with a rich research experience in
              tropical biology, and lead them to a greater understanding of the ecology and
              biodiversity of this world resource.
 This project will also help to develop
              well-trained researchers, capable of working in an international setting. ***
