              Summary
Building the Technology Workforce in Indiana: Undergraduate
              Scholarships in Information Technology, Computer Science, and Electronic and
              Computer Technology


This project provides thirty-two scholarships to
              academically talented low-income students enrolled in a newly created
              Information Technology degree program, or in existing and highly regarded
              programs in Computer Science, and Electronic and Computer Technology. As part
              of the program, scholars are embraced in a unique First Year learning community
              designed to provide academic and social support to ensure their continued
              success toward their degree and in the university environment. Faculty
              advisor/mentors build relationships with the scholars, providing critical
              support as they monitor and guide. Internships with high tech industry partners
              offer scholars valuable career related experiences. Placement of graduating
              scholars in the workplace is facilitated through workshops and individual
              assistance. The program incorporates a wide range of student support services
              aimed to improve scholarship, retention to graduation, and successful
              employment in appropriate high technology careers.
