Abstract    :
              This program provides financial and academic support for students in marine
              engineering technology, marine engineering technology with license option and
              maritime systems engineering. Students from eight especially diverse high
              schools in the Houston/Galveston area are recruited to participate in the
              program as entering freshmen, and are tracked as a cohort over the four year
              duration. Selection of participants is based on an application process reviewed
              by a selection committee and is competitive based on standard criteria
              including financial need and merit. The program provides specialized diagnostic
              testing, tutoring, supplemental instruction, mentoring and career services to
              help them successfully persist, graduate and find employment or pursue a
              graduate degree in the engineering field. A summer bridge workshop in
              mathematics is a critical element in preparing the entering students.
