Abstract    :
              The investigators will analyze data from an equatorial scintillation station at
              Ancon, Peru, and conduct modeling studies associated with the electrodynamics
              of the low latitude ionosphere under quiet and disturbed magnetic conditions. 
              The effort includes experimental campaigns in South America in the first and
              third years.  Other instruments to be operated during the campaigns are
              Fabry-Perot interferometers, GPS receivers, digisondes, and the low power mode
              of the Jicamarca Radar (JULIA).  The primary goal of the study is to understand
              what conditions determine the onset of equatorial scintillations.  Merging
              different data sets will allow the investigators to determine the background
              conditions of the ionosphere during the onset of scintillation and expand our
              view of the unstable plasma region.  Specific areas of research include
              identifying the spatial coherence of the zonal irregularity drifts, the
              relation between scintillations and F-region irregularities, and the effect of
              geomagnetic disturbances on irregularity growth.  The results of the study will
              contribute to the development of models for specifying and predicting
              scintillation conditions that might cause disruptions in transionospheric
              communication and navigation signals.
