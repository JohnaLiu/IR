Abstract    :
              The AAAS Project on Science, Technology, and Disability has played a leadership
              role in supporting the advancement of people with disabilities in science,
              mathematics and engineering since 1975, more than a decade before the mandate
              of the Americans with Disabilities Act. This program encourages scientists and
              engineers to self-identify and thus created the AAAS Resource Group of
              Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities, producing a group of about 1,000
              scientists and engineers who serve as mentors. The AAAS Disability Project has
              become the most important resource for individuals and organizations seeking to
              encourage the entry and advancement of person with disabilities in science and
              engineering. The AAAS Disability Project, has a new program: Entry Point!,
              which has made more than 245 placements of students with disabilities in paid
              summer internships. The students are diverse in ethnicity, gender, and type of
              disability. All are mentored through the process of application, internship
              offer, relocation, research work, and follow up.
