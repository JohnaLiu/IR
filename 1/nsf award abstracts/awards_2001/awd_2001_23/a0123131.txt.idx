Abstract    :
              Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI) in partnership with the
              National Science Foundation will increase the number of Native Americans
              matriculating into science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET)
              baccalaureate programs and/or entering  the science and technology workforce.
              This will be accomplished through a comprehensive program, irVision-21le which
              includes: a) curriculum development in calculus, physics and chemistry; b)
              standards-based faculty development in problem-solving instructional
               strategies and in the use of instructional technologies; c) two-year student
              experiences in research; and, c) an expanded program for networking
              professionals leading to industry certification to address the need for
              information technology workers in Native American communities.  The project
              is designed to improve student-learning outcomes in calculus, physics,
              and chemistry.  Students will participate in inquiry-based learning strategies
              delivered through a technology-enriched curriculum that is
              delivered/facilitated by a skilled faculty.  Native American undergraduates
              will also participate in meaningful research experiences that  will lead to
              improved diverse career opportunities, particularly in the SMET fields.
               Students will learn and write about the research process, and develop
              presentations for professional student forums. This is a learning experience
              that is rarely afforded  to two-year undergraduates. Finally to address the
              need for certified information  technology professionals in the U.S., and
              especially among Tribal Nations, SIPI will expand its networking training
              program, allowing for industry certification.  Project staff in collaboration
              with faculty will develop an extensive evaluation and assessment program. 
              Staff will encourage and monitor student enrollment  and success in college
              courses that will prepare students for science, mathematics, engineering and
              technology careers.  Curricula products will be packaged and shared  with
              Native serving institutions, and evaluation and assessment results will be
               electronically disseminated.
