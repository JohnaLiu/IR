Abstract    :
              The goal of this scholarship project is to help produce additional computer
              science graduates to meet industry demands. Computer science graduates from the
              college have been successful in both industry and graduate school, and the
              college has a very strong relationship with the local technology-related
              industry. The curriculum in computer science has been evaluated and refined
              recently by both internal and external reviewers and shown to produce high
              quality graduates. Students also have the opportunity to participate in a
              variety of service activities, including community service. The program is
              producing graduates who are making a contribution to the computing profession
              by maintaining high standards and a rigorous curriculum that has evolved with
              the changes in the discipline. Programs like this project are enabling the
              college to further leverage the almost 20 year investment in computer science
              by increasing retention and enrollment.
