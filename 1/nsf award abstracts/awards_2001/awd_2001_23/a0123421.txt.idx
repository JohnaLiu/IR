Abstract    :
                   The need for more bandwidth and capacity in wireless systems currently is
              the main culprit for the great interest in the development of wireless
              communications systems operating at millimeter wave frequencies and higher.
              The future needs of broad-band interactive services (1Gb/s) demand
              the application of optical fiber feed networks for distribution of the radio
              signals to and from the antennas at the various base stations. Fiber-optic
              technologies have reached the stage where insertions into various commercial
              RF systems are being considered. Today, there are three main steps in the
              evolution of RF/Photonics systems for wireless communications. The first step
              has been in the direction of using photonics to slowly replace conventional RF
              components, such as, the coax that is used to interconnect the antenna to the
              electronics. Optical fibers, in contrast to coaxial cable, provide a more ideal
              medium for broadband RF communication systems. The light weight property of
              fibers, and its immunity from other signal interference make them very
              critical in the development of future RF distribution systems. The second, and
              more challenging step, is in the seamless integration of photonics and RF
              wireless circuits. The challenge in this step is to use photonics and RF
              circuits as complementary systems and blend them together. Finally, the third
              step is towards the development of optically coupled antennas. In this step
              the aim is to eliminate the need of local oscillators, mixers, amplifiers and
              a host of other parts by directly feeding an antenna through a fiber at
              millimeter wave frequencies.      Here, it is proposed that an array of RF
              modulator/photodetectors be integrated directly to an array of antennas. This
              new RF/photonic antenna array system, with the appropriate space-time
              processing and coding, will form a iosmart antennaln that can enhance network
              coverage, capacity, and quality. It is envisioned that a large number of such
              RF/Photonic antenna elements could be networked together into a star
              configuration, feeding in and out of a radio hub.      As a transmitter, the
              proposed optoelectronic device operates as a photodiode, while as a
              receiver the device operates as an optical modulator. It has already been
              demonstrated that this dual function of a semiconductor electroabsorption
              modulator and photodiode in the same device for duplex operation, can occur,
              using bias control as a transmit/receive mode control. For full duplex
              operation, two modulator/photodiode devices need to be incorporated in the
              each transceiver element.      We propose to directly drive a coplanar
              waveguide (CPW)-fed slot antenna by converting optical power into microwave
              power and vice versa using these RF modulator/photodetectors. As a
              transmitter, the CPW line is connected to the active surface of the
              photodetector, from which the microwave power propagates to feed the radiating
              slot. The photodetector is fed via an optical fiber from beneath. When
              the device functions as an optical modulator, the receive function can also be
              achieved. Preliminary results for a single antenna show that a very good
              bandwidth and radiation patterns can be achieved.      It should be noted that
              these elements can be interconnected via the fiber to achieve
              summation, mixing and other signal processing functions, at the antenna site
              or at a remote site. Some preliminary results have been achieved in the area
              of multiple functionality for the optoelectronic components, such
              as modulation, photodetection, self-biasing and RF frequency mixing. They have
              shown properties, such as high bandwidth and high power, that are desirable
              for the antenna applications. A main emphasis here is to further investigate
              the material and device designs for the optoelectronic component that
              can incorporate into the smart antenna architecture.      The proposed
              approach will have significant impacts on wireless communication systems
              by providing higher system bandwidth capacity and enhancing their reliability.
              It may lead to a new type of long distance, broadband network infrastructure
              that supports transparent transport of optical signals.      Our team is
              formed to provide the expertise in the four key elements for this proposed
              research. Our project will provide a good opportunity to train graduate and
              undergraduate students in one of the most exciting interdisciplinary areas in
              science (RF, photonics, signal processing and communications). The
              interactions between the researchers at the different institutions will be
              aided by the close collaboration that exists between the members of the group.
