Abstract    :
              This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs (OPP) of the National
              Science Foundation (NSF), provides support for U.S. participation in an
              international workshop and associated planning activities of the Antarctic
              Neotectonics (ANTEC) initiative. The goal of the ANTEC program is to improve
              understanding of the unique character of the neotectonic regime of the
              Antarctic plate, including measurement of, and discrimination between, glacial
              and tectonic kinematic signals, mapping the structure of the Antarctic
              lithosphere and asthenosphere, investigating the stress field and
              seismotectonic features of the Antarctic plate, and understanding the nature of
              coupling between tectonics, climate and erosion. A workshop at the Certosa di
              Pontignano, Siena, Italy, will bring together scientists active in Antarctic
              neotectonics research to assess the current status of neotectonic research
              programs, and to develop a detailed science plan for future research. Nearly
              45% of the research projects currently funded by the Antarctic Geology and
              Geophysics Program of NSF-OPP are either focused directly on, or are pertinent
              to, Antarctic neotectonic science themes. Consequently, broad representation of
              the U.S. research community at the ANTEC workshop is important. Funds provided
              by this award will support U.S. participation in the workshop and will cover
              costs associated with dissemination of the workshop results through publication
              of a workshop report, a brochure summarizing the ANTEC initiative, and via the
              ANTEC web site.
