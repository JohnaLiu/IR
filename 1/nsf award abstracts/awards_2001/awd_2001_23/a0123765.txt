Abstract    :
              A new generation of sophisticated, multi-party distributed applications are
              being proposed and implemented over the Internet.  Many of these applications,
              such as distributed publish-subscribe services, ubiquitous files system and
              distributed auctions, require the location and coordination of a large number
              of resources dispersed throughout the network.  A fundamental building block
              for these applications, is a distributed directory.  The distributed directory
              enables applications to locate required resources in a timely and efficient
              manner, and helps the application to scale.

The proposal describes TerraDir;
              a set of protocols for implementing customizable, distributed, peer-to-peer
              directories over which a range of wide-area resource discovery applications can
              be implemented.  The architecture addresses scalability and flexibility.  The
              research will concentrate on:
- dynamic view implementation (decoupling naming
              from location)
- configurability (applications are not monolithic, must
              address wide needs)
- caching (multiple locations of caches)
- fault
              tolerance (required for success), and
- network layer techniques for finding
              peers and distributing applications.

Each TerraDir Directory is a private
              namespace, and multiple TerraDirs can be active at the same time to provide
              other virtual directors.  Since the TerraDir is designed to be implemented over
              the existing Internet, the protocols address end-to-end requirements and do not
              require any special network support.
