Abstract    :
              Piedmont Technical College's project increases enrollment, retention and
              graduation rates in associate degree programs in computer technology, science,
              engineering, and mathematics (CSEM) for low-income, academically talented
              students, particularly those from underrepresented populations. This is
              accomplished through the provision of targeted, comprehensive academic support
              services, coupled with up to 30 scholarship awards per year. PTC CSEM Scholars
              are recruited in partnership with school districts and community agencies, with
              an emphasis on populations that are typically underrepresented in CSEM fields.
              The project also includes the creation of a "student ambassador corps" to
              assist in recruitment of high school students, targeted supplementary peer
              tutoring for students in barrier courses, and peer mentoring by senior CSEM
              students for students enrolled in developmental courses.
