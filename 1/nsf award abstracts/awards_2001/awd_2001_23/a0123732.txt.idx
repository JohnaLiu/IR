Abstract    :
              Sin Nombre Hantavirus (SNV) is a highly virulent, rodent-borne virus that causes
              the often fatal Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) in humans.  The highest
              frequencies of this disease are found in the US Southwest.  The rodent vector
              of the pathogen is the common deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus.  The
              antiquity of the virus, and the high frequency of HPS in the Southwest, raise
              questions about its role in human prehistory in the region.  Prehistoric
              populations of the region were sedentary, high population density maize
              agriculturalists.  Grain storage and processing practices of the time would
              have increased human-mouse contact.  This exploratory project will use
              established ancient DNA methods to attempt to recover diagnostic nucleic acids
              of Sin Nombre Virus from archaeologically recovered remains of P. maniculatus
              in the US Southwest.  Samples are expected to be 1,000-2,000 years old and will
              be directly dated using carbon-14.  In addition to ancient DNA methods,
              immunohistochemical and immunoflorescent methods for the detection of antigens
              and antibodies specific to SNV will be attempted.  The purpose of the project
              is to document the presence of SNV as a potential disease vector during
              Southwestern prehistory.  Demonstration of SNV presence as a disease vector in
              antiquity has a variety of implications for prehistoric population dynamics in
              the region.
