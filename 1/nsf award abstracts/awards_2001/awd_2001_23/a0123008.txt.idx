Abstract    :
               Ten (10) new Scholarships for Success are to be awarded each of the first two
              years and twenty-five (25) new scholarships are to be awarded in the third and
              fourth years to academically capable, low-income students in computer science,
              computer technology, engineering, and engineering technology. Each cohort of
              scholars receives assistance from The Career Center in finding part-time
              employment opportunities and opportunities for cooperative education,
              internships, and on-the-job training, career development, planning and job
              selection. In addition a faculty mentor is assigned to each scholarship
              recipient cohort.
