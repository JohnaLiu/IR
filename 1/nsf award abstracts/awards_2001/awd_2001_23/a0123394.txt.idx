Abstract    :
              0123394  Semmens  The objective of this research is to investigate the behavior
              of membrane aerated biofilms in carefully designed studies.  Existing computer
              models will be used to select conditions for experimental testing and
              experimental design.  A combination of microscopic techniques, chemical
              measurements made with microprobes and bio-molecular assays of the biofilms
              will be used to characterize biofilm behavior under a variety of operating
              conditions.  The data will be used to calibrate and refine the computer model
              to improve process simulation with the ultimate objective of providing a useful
              tool for bioreactor design. Membrane aerated biofilm reactors are used in water
              treatment for the degradation of soluble organics, and nitrogen removal. ***
