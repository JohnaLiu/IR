This Americas Program award will support Dr. Madhavan
              Raghavan of the University of Iowa to make a planning visit to work in
              collaboration with Dr. Erasmo S. da Silva from the University of Sao Paulo in
              Brazil. This planning visit will permit the researchers to perform pilot
              studies and plan a collaborative research proposal.  The overall objectives of
              the proposed research are: (1) To study the biomechanical properties of
              abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) using specimens obtained during autopsies
              performed at Sao Paulo University School of Medicine and (2) To evaluate the
              practicalities of the long-term collaboration.  The structure of the planning
              visit takes into account the intellectual and physical assets of both
              participating investigators.

The long-term goal is to comprehensively study
              the biomechanical properties of abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Both of the
              participants in the study, and their associates, will learn much about the
              science and the technique practiced by their counterparts.  If the follow up
              were successful, the results would be of significant benefit worldwide.
