Abstract    :
              This program provides academic and financial support to talented low-income
              students in applied computer science, mathematics, and industrial computer
              systems. Program objectives include expanding the professional development
              opportunities for students, strengthening partnerships between the university
              and employment sectors related to the targeted disciplines, and retaining
              project students at a rate that exceeds the retention of non-project students
              in the same disciplines. Student support structures include group meetings,
              faculty mentors for scholars, involvement in professional organizations,
              industrial internships, and shadowing of working professionals in industry.
