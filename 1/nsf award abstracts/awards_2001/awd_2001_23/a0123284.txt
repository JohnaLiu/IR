Abstract    :
              This SGER is to investigate "to what degree it is feasible, given to the
              constraints of a typical in-service teacher enhancement program, to teach high
              school mathematics teachers to use a CCS [Classroom Communication System]
              effectively and make their teaching become more learner-centered,
              assessment-centered, and community-centered."  The research is tied to the
              release of a new generation of networkable calculators within the past few
              months and a unique opportunity to work with teachers this summer who are being
              introduced to this technology.  The PIs are researching how readily teachers
              change their teaching to incorporate some of the opportunities provided by this
              technology.  Follow-up visits to classrooms are included.
