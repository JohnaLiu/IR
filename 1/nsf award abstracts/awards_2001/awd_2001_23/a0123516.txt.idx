Abstract    :
              AST-0123516 Brown, Michael E.  The Advanced Electro-Optical System (AEOS) on
              Haleakela, Maui, Hawaii of the US Air Force with its adaptive optics system
              will be used to monitor the weather on Titan to determine the location,
              formation rate and evolution of large scale cloud outbursts. Measurements of
              the speed of the winds made in this work will provide data for an estimate of
              the drift of the Huygens Titan probe on the Cassini spacecraft.  This will
              establish how long the probe can be expected to remain in communication contact
              with scientists. The behavior of the Methane condensation (clouds on Titan)
              events is of immediate interest to the interpretation of Huygens data and will
              provide important insight into the dynamical behavior of the atmosphere and
              possible localized sources of condensable Methane.  A graduate student will
              carry out much of this work.  ***
