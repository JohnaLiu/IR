Abstract    :
              The Information Technology Scholars (ITS) program is using a grant from the
              National Science Foundation's Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics
              Scholarship (CSEMS) program to establish ongoing support for academically
              promising students with financial need to graduate with a Bachelor of Science
              in Computer Science from St. Bonaventure University and to enter the workforce
              as information technology professionals. The CSEMS funds are used to support
              four students for four years and an additional four students for three years.
              The university will continue the program by funding the final year of the
              second cohort of students and by providing four-year awards to two students per
              year annually. 
The program is designed to attract students who have
              demonstrated a strong work ethic and commitment to computer science as high
              school students. The Department will use the one hundred and fifty high school
              teachers who have participated in departmental outreach programs to recommend
              students for the program. 
The Department has an exemplary record for
              preparing undergraduates for entry-level positions in information technology.
              Since 1989 100% of its graduates have entered the workforce as computer
              professionals or have gone on for further study at the graduate level in
              computer science.
