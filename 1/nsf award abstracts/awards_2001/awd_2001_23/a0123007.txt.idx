Abstract    :
              This program provides support to talented, low-income students seeking associate
              degrees in computer science, engineering, or mathematics at one of four
              community colleges: Capital, Gateway, Manchester, and Tunxis. Computer science,
              engineering technology, and mathematics faculty on each campus serve as mentors
              and advisors to the CSEMS scholars. Group and peer mentoring activities,
              industrial externships, and research opportunities are offered during two,
              two-year scholarship cycles.
