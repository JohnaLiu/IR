Abstract    :
              The international mobility of highly skilled workers, in particular human
              resources in science and technology (HRST) is an important and growing policy
              issue with a number of countries.  The project is a preliminary investigation
              of the statistical, methodological, economic and policy issues involved in the
              international mobility of skilled workers, especially IT specialists, research
              scientists and engineers or entrepreneurs.  Results from the statistical
              components of this work will feed into the revision of the "Canberra manual"
              which sets international guidelines for the measurement of human resources in
              science and technology.  Expected outcomes of the project are (1) new
              indicators reflecting international mobility for a range of countries to be
              published in 2001; (2) An international conference on the issue scheduled for
              2001; (3) a compendium of country studies and international statistics will be
              published in 2001/2 containing revised and expanded versions of works presented
              at the conference.
