Abstract    :
              Atmospheric flows such as mid-latitude jets are, in general, time-dependent so
              that a comprehensive stability theory for these systems must address the
              influence of temporal variation in the background flow on the growth and
              structure of perturbations. Another important application of time-dependent
              instability theory is in relation to the growth of initial errors in tangent
              linear models. In this project, the PI plans to pursue further the non-modal
              stability theory he and his group developed for time-varying flows to study
              deterministic stability problems related to the origin and maintenance of upper
              level short waves. In addition, the PI will investigate the statistical mean
              structure and dynamics of synoptic scale variance through stochastic forcing.
              The project has the potential of obtaining new insight into linear instability
              with time-varying flows that may provide new understanding for mid-latitude
              synoptic weather phenomena such as storm tracks.
