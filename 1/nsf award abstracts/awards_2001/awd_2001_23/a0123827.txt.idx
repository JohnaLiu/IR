Abstract    :
              This grant provides partial support of the fifth in a series of international
              conferences on applications of airborne remote sensing to be held at San
              Francisco, CA on 17-20 September 2001.  It is estimated that approximately 800
              people will attend the San Francisco meeting and that the technical program
              will consist of at least 300 papers on different aspects of airborne remote
              sensing.  The purpose of the conference is to foster communication and
              collaboration between the scientific, governmental, and commercial communities
              in the use of recent developments in airborne remote sensing technology.
