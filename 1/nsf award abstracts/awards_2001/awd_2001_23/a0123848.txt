Abstract    :
              
This comprehensive scholarship program is promoting the success of 30
              Information Technology, Engineering & Technology, and Mathematics students
              (ITETM) each year. The students demonstrate academic potential and talent and
              are enrolled in a ITETM program leading to an Associate degree.

The ITETM
              Project has the following objectives and goals:
(1) To increase the number of
              educated, skilled employees in technical areas of local and national need;
(2)
              To improve educational opportunities for talented NSF-CSEMS students from
              special populations, such as low-income, disabled, educationally disadvantaged
              or underrepresented;
(3) To increase student retention rates for degree
              achievement and transfer; and
(4) To strengthen partnerships between the
              college, area high schools and colleges, and local high technology
              industries.
(5) To expand research experiences for students in ITETM
              disciplines by forming and strengthening partnerships with high tech industries
              on Long Island.

The ITETM Project is being evaluated in terms of:
(1)
              student retention, graduation and transfer (to four-year colleges) rates and/or
              attainment of employment in computer science, engineering, and other technology
              areas;
(2) success rates in passing specific industry certification exams;
              and
(3) satisfaction of local industry and communities with the results of the
              program.
