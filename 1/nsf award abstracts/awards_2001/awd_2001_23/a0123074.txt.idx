Abstract    :
              The Emerging Mathematics, Engineering and Technology Scholars program supports
              students who major in computer science, mathematics, engineering, or
              technology. Students are chosen based on merit and need. The program provides
              enhanced advising and financial support to assist in recruitment and retention.
              The scholars join the NSF HBCU-UP, MARC (Minority Access to Research Careers)
              and NASA scholars in the Emerging Caribbean Scientists (ECS) program for
              monthly meetings which provide a support group for the students.
