Abstract    :
              The rapid development of wireless communications technologies and their impact
              on everyday life has greatly increased over the last couple of years.  But, the
              traditional client/server architecture, where the client relies completely on
              the server for information, is not useful in the wireless environment, as the
              server is often not reachable because it is not connected.

The proposal
              focuses on the development of wireless communications technologies and plans to
              design, develop and implement a "client/proxy/server system" in which a
              client-side proxy assumes the role of a local server during the disconnections.
              

Preliminary work shows that the approach has great potential to improve
              data access, computation and service.  The targeted application areas include
              distance learning, fast mobile Internet as well as 3rd and 4th generation
              wireless cellular networks.
