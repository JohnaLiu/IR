Abstract    :
              The Connecticut College NSF Math and Computer Science Scholarship Program has
              three primary objectives: to enhance both the quantity and quality of students
              entering our existing math and computer science program, especially those from
              underrepresented minorities such as women and students of color; to increase
              retention of students who are enrolled in the math and computer science
              programs through extensive support services and through programs which increase
              the knowledge and skills of the students; and to expand the number of high
              school students considering math and computer science as career options by
              encouraging the scholarship students to become leaders and role models.  The
              scholarship program specifically targets high school students, especially women
              and ethnic and racial minorities, with an interest in or an aptitude for math
              and computer science. Students in this program are mentored by faculty advisors
              in their field and by alumni or others in the local community with related
              careers. The students obtain applied skills through participation in
              internships, independent studies, and math practicums. In addition, they
              present results of their work at conferences, open houses, and to others
              outside the department. They learn leadership and teaching skills through
              work-study appointments in the Math and Computer Science Help Centers or in
              Information Services, as well as from the experience of mentoring incoming
              students. Finally, students in this program are guided toward appropriate job
              placement or graduate school by career counselors.
