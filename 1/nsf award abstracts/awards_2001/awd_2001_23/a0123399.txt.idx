Abstract    :
              At the end of this decade, national and international-scale scientific
              collaborative applications will need intelligent signaling and dynamic control
              of very-high-performance optical networks. The software proposed here will
              allow scientific applications to directly control an advanced, all-optical,
              IP-over-wavelength metropolitan-scale network, based on Dense Wave Division
              Multiplexing (DWDM) and photonic switching. Optical networking technology is
              rapidly migrating from ultra-expensive long-haul implementations to regional-
              and metro-area networks. The trend is to provide a general infrastructure with
              a wide range of common services. However, the flexibility inherent in these new
              technologies provides the research community with an opportunity to move beyond
              general requirements and support large-scale e-science applications that
              require advanced networking capabilities. We propose a software development
              effort that will lead to 21st-century applications over 1000-fiber,
              1000-wavelength photonic networks. These evolving, extreme applications
              requiring optical networks include high-energy physics, astrophysics, climate
              modeling, oceanographic modeling, architectural design, molecular modeling,
              industrial design, advanced photon source experimentation, materials science,
              and industrial engineering. Underlying such applications are cross-cutting
              support technologies, such as advanced digital video, remote access to
              scientific instruments, specialized visualization displays, data-mining,
              cluster supercomputing and high-performance distributed computational systems.
              To enable the full potential of such applications, it is not sufficient to
              simply provide high-performance networks; these applications need intelligent,
              dynamic controls to adjust network resources. The proposed software development
              efforts will leverage the significant potential of a newly installed metro
              optical testbed for application-level dynamic control of resource discovery,
              allocation and adjustment. Efforts at many levels are required to make such
              flexibility available in service provisioning, infrastructure and service
              resource management: Research into the behavior of advanced scientific
              applications, not just on extremely high-performance optical network, but on
              one that can be dynamically adjusted at a granular level Identify
              application-level networking requirements, investigate management techniques
              for optical networks, and study new service provisioning models related to
              application needs Research new methods for application signaling Investigate
              interconnections between application signaling and IP-based control-plane
              methods, such as through GMPLS Test deployment of those techniques on an
              advanced testbed and analyze results Experiment with multiple-service
              provisioning to ensure gateways to traditional networks and protocols Develop
              a system for performance metrics, monitoring and analysis Create a testbed for
              StarLight, the next-generation, optically based STAR TAP, and for other
              advanced research networks. The testbed for this project is an a four-node
              optical network, OMNInet, initially linking a core node on Northwestern
              University's Chicago campus with a node at the University of Illinois at
              Chicago, the Canadian Network for the Advancement of Research, Industry and
              Education (CANARIE) CA*net4 node at its Chicago Point of Presence and a node at
              Northwestern's Evanston campus. The sites are separated by distances of 5 to 20
              miles, connected by dedicated technology trial-fiber service provided by
              SBC/Ameritech. Each node includes a Nortel Networks WDM photonic switch, an
              Optical Fiber Amplifier (OFA) and high performance router/switches. These sites
              will also have access to Nortel and SBC/Ameritech testing personnel, expertise,
              and equipment. Participants in this project, led by the Electronic
              Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago,
              include the International Center for Advanced Internet Research at Northwestern
              University, CANARIE, Argonne National Laboratory, MREN (Metropolitan Area
              Research and Education Network), Nortel and Ameritech.
