Abstract    :
              This award supports the development of a new database of science and
              engineering department chairs and the development and administration of a
              comprehensive survey of department chairs. The department chairs survey will
              collect information about the respondents' personal and professional
              background, their career-related perceptions and attitudes, and
              the institutional setting of their department. This data will support detailed
              multivariate analysis examining the determinants of women's entry into, or
              lack of movement into, positions of departmental leadership.   The lack of
              demographic data on department chairs and the processes by which they are
              chosen represents a significant gap in the knowledge about the progress of
              women in assuming a key academic leadership position. To address this gap in
              knowledge, project objectives are to develop and implement a department chairs
              survey and to construct a new database of demographic and career-related
              information on science and engineering department chairs. This study will help
              to achieve significant change by bringing to light the criteria and
              processes used to select chairs. Institutional accountability and presence of
              public data on the proportions of female chairs can make a profound difference
              in the level of attention paid to the appointments. Systemic change must
              include not only increasing leadership diversity in the upper administrative
              levels, but also at the local level (i.e., the department). The chair is
              also critical to initiating other change within the department.  This
              project is jointly supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program and the National
              Institutes of Health. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase
              the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through
              the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and
              engineering careers.
