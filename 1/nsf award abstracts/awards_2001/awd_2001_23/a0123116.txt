Abstract    :
              The project goal is to offer a variety of academic services to low-income
              college students from underrepresented groups to enable them to complete a
              bachelor's degree and compete in the work force as professionals or continue
              graduate studies in computer science or electronic engineering technology. The
              services that the project provides to achieve this goal include scholarship
              stipends; a program of scholarly activities to prepare students to carry out
              research; an individual research project; seminars, and other educational
              activities; tutoring; academic counseling; motivational activities; internship
              in industry; and activities to assist participants in securing admission to and
              financial assistance for enrollment in graduate programs, especially in
              computer science and electronics engineering technology. The one-hundred twenty
              students selected for the project will be students who are academically
              talented, have potential to succeed in their studies, but have not had the
              opportunity to develop their talents and potential due to economic and other
              limitations.
