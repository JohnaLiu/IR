Abstract    :
                Project Summary. The Centennial Scholars Project is allowing students with
              high academic potential and financial need to benefit from a
              laboratory-intensive curriculum providing hands-on education, partnerships with
              industry, and access to senior faculty in small classes. Twenty-nine
              scholarships of $3,125 each are being awarded annually to students majoring in
              mathematics, industrial and manufacturing engineering, mechanical engineering,
              or computer science. The majority of the scholarships are two-year awards for
              freshmen; these scholarships are automatically renewed providing the students
              maintain eligibility. A special emphasis is placed on assisting the scholars in
              overcoming points of unusually high attrition (normally the first five quarters
              of enrollment for freshmen and the first year for transfer students) more
              successfully than a demographically comparable group. The support services
              available include mentoring by alumni with industry experience, supplemental
              instruction in mathematics and physics, prioritized access to academic
              enrichment resources, and opportunities for hands-on research.   PROPOSAL
