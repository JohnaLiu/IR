Abstract    :
              This project aims to create and disseminate instructional materials on nanoscale
              science and technology for use in undergraduate science and engineering
              curricula. A text, demonstrations, and laboratory experiments are being
              developed around the themes of nanoparticles, nanoporous materials, and
              nanoarchitectures. Examples of nanoparticles include colloidal metals,
              ferrofluids, semiconductor quantum dots, and artificial atoms. Nanoporous
              materials include aerogels, dendrimers, micelles, and zeolites.
              Nanoarchitectures focuses on nanotubes, amorphous metals and quasicrystals,
              giant magnetoresistance (GMR) structures, LEDs/diode lasers, self-assembly, and
              surface reconstruction. Collectively, these products illustrate the importance
              of surface effects, the limitations of scaling laws, and the onset of quantum
              effects as nanoscale dimensions are approached. They also demonstrate the tools
              and techniques required for nanoscale studies, including scanning probe
              microscopies, lithographic and contact printing techniques, and mechanical,
              electrical, optical, and magnetic characterization of materials and devices.
              The project is being conducted with assistance from experts from academia,
              industry, and national laboratories, and with resources from the University of
              Wisconsin-Madison NSF-supported Materials Research Science and Engineering
              Center (MRSEC) on Nanostructured Materials and Interfaces. The inherently
              interdisciplinary themes of nanoscale science and technology will be adapted
              for use in a variety of science, mathematics, engineering and echnology (SMET)
              classes through a pair of workshops. The first workshop aims to acquaint
              leading individuals from various SMET disciplines with the materials being
              developed so as to customize them for use across disciplines. The second
              workshop aims to introduce publishers and textbook writers to the materials. In
              addition to publications, products, and presentations, dissemination involves
              partnerships with www.SMETE.ORG, a Core Integration project of the NSF National
              Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Education Digital Library
              (NSDL); and with the University of Wisconsin System, through its Department of
              Defense-supported Academic Advanced Distributed Learning Collaborative
              Laboratory. A collection of web-based learning objects is being created from
              the instructional materials that will be readily accessible, adaptable, and
              affordable. Field testing is an integral part of the project and includes
              volunteers from the full spectrum of post-secondary institutions. Evaluation of
              the project is being conducted using a variety of tools and techniques. Project
              participants include undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctorals, who
              have the opportunity to contribute to this integration of cutting-edge research
              and education. The project aims to enhance science literacy and help attract a
              diverse group of talented undergraduates to technical careers and to teaching
              careers.
