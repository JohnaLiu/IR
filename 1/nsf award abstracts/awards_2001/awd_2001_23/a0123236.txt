Abstract    :
              This planning project is designed to improve mathematics science and learning
              
opportunities for Sitting Bull College students, "to each according to
              his/her needs". 
The planning process will identify the needs of four distinct
              groups of students. 
Group one: students whose career fields do not require
              extensive mathematics and 
science preparation.  Group two: students entering
              science and engineering fields. 
Group three: students entering fields such as
              human services and business where 
mathematic curriculum can be taught to make
              use of quantitative methods in 
decision making.  Group four: students
              entering the elementary and middle school
teaching, and must be aware of North
              and South Dakota performance standards.
