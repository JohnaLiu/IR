Abstract    :
              This project reaches out to attract a heterogeneous mix of students, including
              ethnically diverse and under-represented minorities, as well as women into
              engineering and engineering technology programs. We have developed methods for
              motivating students to pursue a degree program, in part, by offering financial
              incentives to academically talented but economically disadvantaged students
              in Engineering Technology (Electrical, Computer, and Telecommunication) and
              Engineering Science programs. The program increases retention rates of these
              students by providing enhanced support structures and prepares the students to
              be successful employees in the technical work force. The support is provided
              by forming a learning community comprised of students, faculty advisors/mentors
              from each discipline, and industry mentors.
