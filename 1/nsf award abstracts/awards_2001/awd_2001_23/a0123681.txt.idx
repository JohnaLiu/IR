Abstract    :
              Over the past thirty years Spelman College has made great strides in its efforts
              to increase the number of women and the number of African American students
              who complete bachelor's degrees in mathematics and who enter into and persist
              in graduate programs in the sciences, mathematics and engineering. Those
              efforts have resulted in a greater understanding of the academic training and
              early professional development needs, and the support mechanisms required to
              attract these students into the higher levels of academic excellence and
              academic leadership. It has also resulted in a cadre of women faculty who hold
              leadership positions throughout the SEM areas in their own disciplines. The
              current ADVANCE project intends to capitalize on past success by pursuing the
              following goals:  a. Use scholarly writings to disseminate information
              regarding support structures aimed at increasing retention among women in
              graduate mathematics programs; and information on support mechanisms to
              advance the careers of women in the scientific community. b. Facilitate the
              transition of the PI back to a full-time research and teaching
              position following a period of long-term leadership in efforts to expand the
              pipeline of academic leaders in SEM areas. c. Increase the capacity of women
              to assume academic positions in higher education as mathematicians and to
              advance to leadership roles in the science, engineering and mathematics
              academic community, with a particular emphasis on minority women.  This
              project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the
              ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and
              engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of
              women in academic science and engineering careers.
