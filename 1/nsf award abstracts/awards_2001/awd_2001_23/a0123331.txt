Abstract    :
              The Department of Science and Engineering Support (DSES) of the National
              Technical Institution for the Deaf (NTID) has provided access and educational
              serves to hearing disabled/impaired students at the Rochester Institute of
              Technology (RIT) for more than thirty years. Each year the program serves100
              students who receive degrees in science, mathematics, and engineering, and
              10-15 underprepared high-school students in a pre-baccalaureate program, as
              well as 150-200 students who are matriculating in other majors and taking
              science/mathematics as part of their curricular requirements.

NTID DSES
              provides mentoring through advising/counseling, tutoring, instruction,
              note-taking and interpretive services, and as a liaison with host colleges as
              advocates for students. Those activities are deemed as critical for this
              population of students who are otherwise ignored or invisible in mainstream
              education.

Also, it is especially beneficial to the greater population of
              students who are not hearing impaired, to be mentored in relating to the
              hearing impaired. This is a positive effect for global society. Programs and
              networks within the NTID are well planned, carefully documented, and provide a
              trusted base for participants.
