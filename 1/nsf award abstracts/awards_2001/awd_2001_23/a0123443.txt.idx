Abstract    :
              Chanover, Nancy J. AST-0087111  The Advanced Electro-Optical System (AEOS) on
              Haleakela, Maui, Hawaii of the US Air Force will be used with an Acousto-Optics
              Tunable Filter (AOTF) instrument provided by the principal investigator to
              study in detail,  the dynamics, vertical structure and thermal balance of the
              atmospheres of the gaseous outer planets Jupiter and Saturn.  Graduate students
              and undergraduate students will participate in all aspects of the project. 
              Hyperspectral images at the high spatial resolution (20 milliarcseconds)
              provided by the adaptive optics of the AEOS will be used to create data at
              different elevations in the planetary atmosphere and for different interacting
              molecular species of gas and for atmosperic aerosols. These data will be
              analyzed to determine the origins of the colors observed on the planetary disk
              and to understand physical and chemical aspects of the atmospheres of these
              planets.  ***
