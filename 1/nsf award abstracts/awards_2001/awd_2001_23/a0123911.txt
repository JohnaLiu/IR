Abstract    :
              As the Internet evolves, so must the monitoring capabilities.  This is
              especially important for evolving applications which require dynamic resource
              allocation such as collaborative applications, GRID technologies and
              distributed computing.  In addition, because of the complexity of the network
              and the rapidly changing requirements of the  applications, it is very
              difficult to predict performance or capability.
	 
This  proposal plans to
              develop a scalable performance monitoring and dynamic prediction infrastructure
              based on The Network Weather Service (NWS).  The NWS operates a distributed set
              of performance sensors, applies a set of fast statistical forecasting
              techniques in near real-time, and generates forecast reports for the resources
              being monitored. The implementation is portable among all the Grid middleware
              infrastructures.  The proposal has two research foci;
1. research and
              development to extend NWS Scalability
2. deployment as research
              infrastructure

The goal will be to develop and deploy The Network
              Performance Oracle which will provide a persistent, internet-accessible service
              for forecasting end-to-end network performance.
