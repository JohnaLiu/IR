	A three-day workshop on "Separability of
              cognitive functions:  What can be learned from Williams Syndrome?" will be held
              in late August of 2001.  The workshop is designed to encourage researchers in
              the Five Colleges and other colleges in New England the the North East states
              to engage in research involving young people with Williams syndrome.  Its
              secondary goal is to bring the Berkshire Hills Music Academy facility and its
              future potential for facilitating research to the attention of the world-wide
              community of Williams researchers.  A third goal is to promote the exchange of
              ideas among researchers with various kinds of expertise in Williams syndrome. 
              All three goals are directed to the larger objective of understanding the
              diwssociations among cognitive abilities exhibited by Williams syndrome people
              and exploring their implications for the basic structure of human cognition and
              the interconnections among distinct cognitive abilities
