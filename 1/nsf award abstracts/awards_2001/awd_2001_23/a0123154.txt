Abstract    :
              This project builds on the PI's research in computational geometry, a branch of
              computer science with deep mathematical roots and ties to many applications
              areas, including computer graphics, robotics, and manufacturing. The PI's
              recent research on folding and unfolding, is a topic brimming with easily
              comprehended unsolved mathematical problems, and with connections to protein
              folding, to manufacturing by sheet metal bending, and to a host of other
              application areas. This project aims to incorporate the latest research in this
              developing area into educational levels from grade school through graduate
              school and industrial research: origami constructions in grade school, creating
              folding toys in middle school, a two-week summer high school course, a new
              interdisciplinary college course, "Folding and Unfolding in Engineering"
              touching on topics from design of the Space Shuttle robotic arms to automotive
              air bag unfurling, an academic monograph readable at several levels, and
              software addressing industrial needs. The goal of the project is to communicate
              the depth of frontier research, the joy of exploring it and its practical
              usefulness, to all these different constituencies, capitalizing on the rare
              accessibility of the research.
