Abstract    :
              The project will investigate a number of fundamental processes governing the
              past, present, and future climates of the Earth. The major themes are
              intermediate complexity climate models applied to climate change and
              paleoclimate problems, observational and theoretical work relating to water
              vapor feedback, and statistical theories of scalar tracers and mixing with
              applications in both the troposphere and stratosphere. A notable feature of
              this effort is its emphasis on theoretical understanding. The project's focus
              is to improve understanding of the coupling between tropical and extratropical
              regions. The linkage between tropical moisture sources and moisture
              distribution in the extratropics (where water vapor can significantly impact
              the radiative cooling to space) motivates project activities in statistical
              mechanics of the mixing of atmospheric constituents, and Hadley cell dynamics
              and transports. Dr. Pierrehumbert will investigate the role of these processes
              in climate variability and global change by conducting experiments with climate
              models that are simpler and faster than general circulation models but which
              retain sufficient dynamics and resolution to represent realistically heat
              transport, water vapor feedback, and other physical processes. The project will
              advance theoretical understanding and modeling of dynamical, thermodynamical,
              and chemical interactions between the tropics and extratropics, in context of
              climate variability and global change.
