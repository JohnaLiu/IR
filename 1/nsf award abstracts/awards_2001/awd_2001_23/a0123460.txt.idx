Abstract    :
              This proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation NSF 01-65 on
              "Ultra-High Capacity Optical Communications and Networking." We have recently
              introduced a hollow dielectric optical fiber which utilizes a one-dimensional
              photonic crystal to guide light. This fiber is predicted to have an unrivaled
              degree of confinement of the electromagnetic energy density in the hollow core
              - allowing for broad-band and low loss transmission with substantially
              decreased non-linear behavior. In this proposal we will focus our efforts on
              creating novel in-fiber optical devices based on the unique characteristics of
              this hollow waveguide. We will theoretically examine the effects of inducing
              large periodic modulations along the axial direction of the fiber. These are
              expected to open large photonic band gaps in the direction of propagation. In
              particular we will study the possibility of creating high Q cavities within the
              fiber. Application to high speed all-optical switching and other novel devices
              will be illustrated. The ability to form all-optical devices in a fiber has
              many technical advantages, reduction of coupling losses to transmission line -
              not being the least. It also opens new opportunities to low cost fabrication of
              optical devices based on fiber production processes. Our efforts will be
              directed towards the formulation of a general theoretical approach, the design,
              development and the experimental realization of in-fiber optical devices based
              on the axially modulated hollow dielectric omnidirectional waveguide.
