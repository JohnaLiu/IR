Abstract    :
              The PIs propose to use astronomical sky spectra to investigate the terrestrial
              nightglow under solar maximum conditions, and in the declining phase of solar
              cycle 23.  The work is directly relevant to the goal of improving our
              understanding of solar-terrestrial interactions, as outlined in the phase III
              agenda of the CEDAR program.  From limited data collected in 2000, they have
              identified most of the Rydberg transitions from atomic oxygen in the visible
              and near-infrared regions of the spectrum.  Except for the lines at 777.4 and
              844.6 nm, these emissions have not previously been seen in the nightglow.  Of
              two types of Rydberg transitions, triplets and quintets, the quintets have been
              little studied even in the laboratory, yet they tend to be the stronger in the
              sky spectra.  The PIs will compare both triplets and quintets against
              theoretical calculations, with the goals of (1) using the observed intensities
              as a relative intensity calibration standard and (2) determining variability in
              the triplets as a consequence of radiation trapping.
