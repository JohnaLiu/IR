This award supports David Kohlstedt and students from the
              University of Minnesota-Twin Cities in a collaboration with Stephen Mackwell of
              the Bayerisches Geoinstitut at the University of Bayreuth, Germany.  The
              project will focus on the evolution of melt topology during deformation of
              partially molten mantle rocks.  The research is motivated by the observation
              that a small amount of melt has a large effect on the physical properties of a
              partially molten rock.  The connectivity and geometry of the melt network
              control permeability, rheology, electrical conductivity, seismic velocities,
              and seismic attenuation.  A new torsion apparatus in the German lab provides
              the best test bed to investigate the evolution of melt topology; quantification
              of the dependence of melt distribution on stress state for developing models of
              melt redistribution is best accomplished by direct comparison of results of
              experiments performed in each lab separately.  The work plan provides for
              extensive participation by graduate students in the international travel and
              research.
