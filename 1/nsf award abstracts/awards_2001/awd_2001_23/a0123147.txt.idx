Abstract    :
              The Hutlee/Umyuarchdelee proposal (Athabascan/Yupik words for leader, boss, a
               good thinker)is a five-year project based on a hybrid of models with proven
              success  in educating minoritystudents. The project will include academic
              enhancement for  gatekeeper math and sciencecourses integrating active
              learning pedagogies, intensive  sessions, and relevant ways of learningfor
              Native students. To sustain student success  the project will provide faculty
              "sponsorship," vigilant student support skills,  incorporate a "Master
              Learner" curriculum to strengthen students-social contexts,  and integrate job
              shadowing and internships with industry and Native organizations.  The
              Interior-Aleutians Campus and Bristol Bay Campus service area comprises 235,000
               squaremiles and 74% Native population. Less than .5% of the students
              enrolling through  these two campuses are full time students. Recruiting
              students from 90 (of Alaska's 220) villages, this project proposes to enroll
              five cohorts in a two-year village-based program. Through course work and
              intensive weeklong sessions during the semester as well as intensive math
              summer sessions, student cohorts will build an academic learning community.
              This learning community will carry on after students complete
              project coursework and transition to urban-based four-year SMET degree
              programs.  Strategic goals of this project are: * To increase Alaska Native
              participation and success in SMET degree gatekeeper courses. * To
              significantly increase the number of Alaska Native students who pursue
              baccalaureate  degrees in SMET disciplines or enter SMET careers. * To
              develop a collaborative program among the University of Alaska Campuses,
              industry,  and Tribal organizations to strengthen SMET academic infrastructure
              for Alaska Native  students. * To provide faculty and students with the tools
              and education to actively use technology in  academic courses. The
              Hutlee/Umyuarchdelee method of delivering gatekeeper math and science courses
              will include curricular enhancements that employ active learning pedagogies
              and include a holistic pedagogical philosophy. Methods of curricular
              enhancements are: * Additional faculty contact time extending math courses
              from three to five days by adding  math labs which integrate methods for
              active learning such as hands-on manipulatives. * Six and eight weeks summer
              math intensives with relevant industry internships. * Weeklong semester-based
              intensive sessions that integrate academics, problem solving,  and Master
              Learner curricular activities. * Building a student cohort academic learning
              community.  Potential impacts of the Hutlee/Umyuarchdelee project are: * To
              develop SMET knowledgeable Alaska Native engineers. * To develop SMET
              knowledgeable Alaska Native leaders who will participate in making  decisions
              about tribal lands that will forever change the lifestyles, economics, and 
              existence of rural Alaskan communities. * To develop curricula and a delivery
              model which will impact not only students and  communities affected though
              this program, extend to other SMET students in different  geographical areas.
