Abstract    :
              This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs (OPP) of the National
              Science Foundation (NSF), provides support, along with matching funds from the
              Environmental Studies Program at Hamilton College, for a workshop to be held at
              Hamilton College in September of 2001. The workshop will involve scientists
              from several other countries, in addition to the United States, who are
              actively involved in environmental research in the region. In addition, the
              workshop will take an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the
              environmental changes taking place in the region of the Antarctic Peninsula.
              The past several decades have demonstrated severe and rapid changes in the
              ecosystems and physical environment of the Antarctic Peninsula and the region
              stands out in the most recent IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)
              report as the strongest regional "hot spot" for increased temperature trends.
              Global climate models that incorporate greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols
              demonstrate a striking correspondence to the observed temperature trends. The
              workshop will address this correspondence and will place historical data into
              the context of geological and glaciological records of climate change over the
              last 12,000 years. Oceanographic and atmospheric linkages will be discussed and
              examined for decadal to millennial time scales. The results will be published
              in a bound volume of the Antarctic Research Series, pending approval by the
              editorial committee.
