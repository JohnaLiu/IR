Abstract    :
              Ilisagvik College in Barrow, Alaska is the lead college in the Consortium for
              Alaska  Native Higher Education, Inc. (CANHE), a non-profit group of Alaska
              Native organizations creating and supporting new Alaska Native-serving
              colleges in Alaska. CANHE was established, in part, because only 4% of Alaska
              Natives (1990) have achieved  baccalaureate degrees. Alaska Natives are poorly
              represented as students in  Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology
              (SMET) programs in Alaska's universities and colleges, as teachers in the
              Alaska schools, and in the occupations requiring these skills. Data on Alaska
              Native higher education achievement is not well collected. It is obvious to
              Alaska natives, however, that different techniques must be used to attract and
              retain Native and rural students in SMET programs than those used for years by
              the state university. Ilisagvik will serve as the lead and  mentor institution
              for the planning and assessment effort over the10 months of  the
              project.  Ilisagvik will engage a project manager to conduct the assessment.
              A CANHE member task force will create a mission statement defining the
              planning goals, priorities and project milestones.  An external advisory board
              will be chaired by Dr. Edna MacLean, the president of Ilisagvik College, and
              will review the planning effort and evaluate the progress. The task force and
              manager will gather data from each of the six members and examine their
              missions, their long-term goals and priorities. The regional needs and
              strengths will become part of the CANHE SMET master plan which will include
              the colleges' resources, governance, culture, technology requirements,  and
              funding strategies. The plan will include assessment of faculty needed and
              the skills available for staff instruction, and inventory the technology
              requirements and the infrastructure support needed in each region. Beyond the
              specific benefits of the assessment to Ilisagvik College, the benefits will
              multiply by involving all the CANHE members in the process and the ultimate
              implementation of the plan.  The group will design practical cost-effective
              methods to create, expand and  collaboratively improve SMET programs for the
              dispersed potential student body  including collaboration with other regions,
              some centralizing support activities,  and integrating incentives to be
              involved for faculty and students. Given the vast  roadless distances between
              communities, the primitive state of rural Alaska telecommunications and
              information infrastructure and the high cost of such services when available,
              there are numerous problems of distance delivery to be identified, understood
              and resolved.   Ilisagvik developed a new Information Technology A.A.S.
              curriculum and acquired  some of the infrastructure to carry out the classes
              through previous funding from  NSF, the American Association of Community
              Colleges, the M. J. Murdock Foundation,  and the Microsoft Corporation. Other
              programs are being developed by CANHE members.  These assets can be shared
              across the state to improve SMET delivery.  Collectively  the colleges can
              register a greater number of students for these courses from the
               multi-regional Native student body and deliver them with a smaller number
              of faculty also taking administrative advantages of cross-registration
              benefits. The data, assessment, and draft plan will be reviewed with the board
              and organizational leadership of each regional colleges prior to adoption to
              affirm,  and modified if required, so that it addresses the needs, direction
              and resources  of each region.
