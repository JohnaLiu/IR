Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding for exploring the development of a novel fiber optic
              acoustic system for high-frequency bandwidth measurements. The novelty of the
              sensor system will be derived from the inclusion of extrinsic sensing
              capabilities based on a Fabry-Perot cavity, an integrated optical circuit based
              phase modulator, a high-speed photo detector, and a digital demodulation scheme
              based on a new multi-step phase stepping algorithm. The Fabry-Perot cavity will
              be located between the fiber tip and the diaphragm structure of the sensor, and
              the Mach-Zehnder interferometer in the phase modulator will be path matched
              with the Fabry-Perot arrangement to act as a read-out interferometer. Both
              experimental efforts and analytical efforts will be pursued for developing the
              sensor and understanding the sensor mechanics.   A potential risk involved in
              the development of this sensor system is that it may not be amenable to
              multiplexing as the other fiber-optic sensors.  If successful, the development
              of this sensor system will have a tremendous impact on integrated active
              control systems for sound and vibration transmission problems where currently
              multiplexable sensors for high-frequency bandwidth applications are not readily
              available.  Furthermore, if the sensor system is adapted, it can be used for
              high-frequency bandwidth pressure measurements in underwater flows.  The sensor
              system may also have applications in the automotive industry such as ignition
              chambers
