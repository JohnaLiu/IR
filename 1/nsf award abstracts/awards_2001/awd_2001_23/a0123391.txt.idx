Abstract    :
              This SGER is to investigate "to what degree it is feasible, given the
              constraints of a typical in-service Teacher Enhancement program, to teach high
              school mathematics teachers to use a CCS [Classroom Communication System]
              effectively and make their teaching become more learner-centered,
              knowledge-centered, assessment-centered and community-centered."  The research
              is tied to the release of a new generation of networkable calculators within
              the past few months and a unique opportunity to work with teachers this summer
              who are being introduced to this technology.  The PIs are researching how
              readily teachers change their teaching to incorporate some of the opportunities
              provided by this technology.  Follow-up visits to classrooms are included.
