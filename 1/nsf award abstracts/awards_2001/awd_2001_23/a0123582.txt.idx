Abstract    :
              This award supports the development and implementation of a workshop for
              prospective and current female professors in science and engineering fields as
              part of the NSF ADVANCE Leadership Awards Program by a group of researchers
              from the George Washington University and Gallaudet University who have
              collaborated for the past five years on projects to increase the numbers of
              women and other underrepresented minorities in advanced Science, Engineering
              and Mathematics (SEM) careers.   Using experience from earlier efforts to
              bring together students from different institutions, large and small, local and
              far away, specialized communities (e.g. women's colleges, historically black
              colleges and universities (HBCUs) and comprehensive, to consider and be
              prepared for graduate school in science, engineering and math (SEM), the PIs
              propose to develop and run a similar workshop for potential and current female
              faculty members in SEM. The proposed activity will benefit from the pipeline
              created by the FORWARD program: participants from this program started in 1997
              will be reaching graduation and the stage of securing a faculty position within
              the proposed timeline of the award. Participation will be solicited from
              across the country and will feature speakers from successful programs and
              careers in SEM.  This project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The
              overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of
              women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased
              representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering
              careers.
