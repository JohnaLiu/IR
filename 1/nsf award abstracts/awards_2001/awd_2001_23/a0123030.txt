Abstract    :
              PROJECT SUMMARY
This project is providing the equivalent of 32 full-time
              scholarships per year to students from educationally under-served backgrounds
              ranging from rural to inner-city environments. In addition to access to a
              quality education, the students receive both faculty and peer mentoring, time
              and resource management counseling, and, if needed, tutoring at no cost. During
              the junior and senior years, students have the opportunity to undertake
              research, participate in technological leadership seminars and engage in
              cooperative education which allows them to simultaneously earn money for
              educationally related expenses and obtain experience in their chosen career
              field.
