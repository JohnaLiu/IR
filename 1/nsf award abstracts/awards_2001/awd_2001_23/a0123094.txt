Abstract    :
              This program attracts and retains financially needy mathematics and computer
              science students, with particular attention focused on those students in
              underrepresented groups; establishes connections with businesses that recruit
              and employ Truman's math and computer science graduates through a variety of
              activities including on-site visits to the businesses; provides a supportive
              atmosphere, including assisting in the formation of learning communities among
              CSEMS scholars, mentoring, and personal tutoring; and helps participants to
              develop an interest and appreciation for mathematics and computer science by
              introducing them to experts and outstanding speakers in the field. Faculty
              coordinate and oversee all activities relating to the program.
