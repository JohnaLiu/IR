Abstract    :
              I propose to initiate an innovative, collaborative small grants program that
              fosters basic research by undergraduate and graduate students on fundamental
              questions related to plant conservation biology. With a third year of funding
              following on my NSF Post-doctoral Fellowship in Science, Mathematics,
              Engineering, and Technology Education, I will forge partnerships between my
              host institution, the New England Wild Flower Society (NEWFS), and academic
              centers in New England to establish a student research program addressing the
              ecology of rare plants, called the NSF/NEPCoP Fellows Program. During fall
              2001, I will solicit research proposals from advanced undergraduate and
              beginning graduate students from academic institutions in New England. I will
              fund six field research studies selected via peer-review and will advise these
              studies during summer, 2002. I will assist students in empirical design, data
              interpretation, and publication. Results from these studies will be published
              as appropriate in scientific journals, and promulgated to relevant conservation
              organizations to facilitate management of rare plant populations.  This
              program will:  Enable students to hone both strong empirical research skills
              and clear communication skills that will         enhance their. Professional
              development and broaden their opportunities for employment; yield valuable new
              data to  advance the science of conservation biology; fund opportunities for
              research in conservation biology not currently covered by grant sources;
              provide.  Critically needed data on species biology to NEWFS and other
              conservation organizations to promote scientifically-based. Conservation
              efforts; serve as a self-sustaining model for collaboration among academic and
              extramural institutions to strengthen data collection efforts and to train a
              new generation of conservation biologists.
