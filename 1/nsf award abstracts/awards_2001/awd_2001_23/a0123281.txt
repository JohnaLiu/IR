Abstract    :
              0123281  Marinas  The objective of the proposed research is to develop a
              fundamental understanding of the pore blockage and solute displacement
              mechanisms of competitive adsorption of trace organic compounds on powdered
              activated carbon (PAC).  This information will be used to develop equations for
              these effects that will be incorporated into mathematical models of hybrid
              sorption-membrane processes.  Adsorption studies will be conducted using model
              compounds or probes, as well as with natural organic matter (NOM).  The
              competitive effects in porous adsorbents will be modeled for the PAC/membrane
              system using the probe data first.  After the model has been verified using
              probes, the general form of the model will be tested for applicability to
              NOM/trace compound competitive adsorption.  The results of this research could
              be used to develop recommendations for the optimum design and operation of
              full-scale hybrid sorption-membrane processes for the removal of trace organic
              compounds from water. ***
