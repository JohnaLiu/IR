Abstract    :
              The investigators will use observations from the Atmospheric Lidar Observatory
              at Utah State University to study the temperature structure of the mesosphere
              and lower thermosphere.  A recent upgrade to the lidar has increased the
              sensitivity of the system by a factor of 30.  The first task is to continue and
              extend ongoing research that involves comparison of measured temperatures with
              those computed using a first-principles model.  Resolution of discrepancies
              will reveal information about the role of gravity waves and chemistry in
              heating, and the effects of the large-scale circulation pattern.  The second
              task is to relate processes occurring below 80 km altitude with processes at
              higher altitudes where measurements have not been possible before.  The third
              task is to look for effects of stratospheric winds and waves in the lower
              thermosphere.  Finally, the lidar will be used to look for further evidence of
              noctilucent cloud formation at mid-latitudes.  Previously confined to high
              latitudes only, the appearance of a noctilucent cloud over Utah in June of 1999
              may be an indication of cooler mesospheric temperatures caused by global
              climate change.
