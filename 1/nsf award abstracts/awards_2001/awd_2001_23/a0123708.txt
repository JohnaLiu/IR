Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project is to explore the
              development of a unified mechanics model for prediction of chatter during
              high-speed milling; in particular, for systems with flexible tools and flexible
              workpieces.  The developed model will include time-delay effects and loss of
              contact effects, and it will allow for features such as partial engagement of a
              tool with the workpiece.  Stability information will be obtained by using tools
              from the nonlinear dynamics area.  This model will be analytically and
              numerically studied to determine stability charts in terms of parameters such
              as spindle speed and axial depth of cut and the sensitivity of these charts to
              feed rate and feed direction will be examined.  Experiments will be conducted
              to validate the model predictions.  

A potential risk involved in the
              development of the model is due to the lack of readily available cutting force
              data for high-speed milling operations.  If successful, the development of this
              model will have a tremendous impact on simulating workpiece-tool interactions,
              selecting machining parameters, and redesigning tools for important industrial
              problems such as the machining of T-shaped stiffeners and return flanges with
              long end mills and the machining of difficult-to-machine materials.
