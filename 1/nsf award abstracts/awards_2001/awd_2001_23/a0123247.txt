Abstract    :
              The proposed project will establish a SMET task force to assess the current
              state of
the math/science program and its facilities at Leech Lake Tribal
              College in order to 
identify current strengths and weaknesses. The project
              will also involve conducting 
surveys to determine student enrollment,
              completion, interest in, and satisfaction of 
students with relationship to
              SMET programs.  In addition, the project will serve to 
identify issues LLTC
              students face when they transfer to four-year institutions, and
to identify
              programmatic trends and opportunities to which the college should respond.
              

The project will identify: State and federal funding opportunities for SMET
              programs;
Bridges-type programs that are available to faculty and students;
              regional research 
programs that could involve faculty and students; online
              SMET-content courses that 
are available to faculty and students. 

As a
              result of the above, a set of goals will be identified and a SMET development
              plan
will be drafted to target identified department needs, partnership
              opportunities with 
schools, regional, tribal and other baccalaureate and
              graduate-degree institutions,
private sector, and federal agencies.
