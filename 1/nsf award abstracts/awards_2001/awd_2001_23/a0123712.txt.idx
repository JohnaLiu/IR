Abstract    :
               IIS-0123712 Allen L. Ambler and Jennifer L. Leopold, University of
              Kansas $26,250 - 12 mos  		  Children's Programming Odyssey    This is
              a standard award.  The 2001 IEEE Symposia on Human-Centric Computing Languages
              and Environments (HCC'01), to be held in Stresa, Italy on September 5-7, will
              include a special event - the Children's Programming Odyssey - featuring some
              of the world's premier researchers in children's programming languages,
              including Alan Kay  (Squeak), Ken Kahn (Toontalk), Allan Cypher (Stagecast),
              and Alex Repenning (AgentSheets).  This is funding to support participation in
              the Odyssey of up to ten graduate students from the United States, who will
              each give brief presentations of their thesis work followed by a positive
              critique from the panel of experts.   Student participants will be invited
              based on materials submitted to a selection committee, to consist of the PI
              (who is also organizer of the Odyssey), Margaret Burnett from Oregon State
              University, and another member yet to be named.  The primary criterion to be
              used by the selection committee is relevance of the student's dissertation
              research to children's programming, computer-based construction environments
              for learning, or end-user programming.  In addition, the student must have done
              sufficient work so that s/he can talk from some experience.  The selected
              students will be expected to submit a 5-page written paper describing their
              current work, to attend HCC'01, and to make a 10-minute presentation in the
              Odyssey.   The students will benefit immensely from this unique opportunity to
              expose their ideas to and to interact with the leading researchers in this
              area;  this nurturing effort is an inexpensive yet effective means of
              encouraging young and upcoming scientists.
