Abstract    :
              CMS-0123932
A primary goal of this symposium is to bring together, engineers,
              scientists and applied mathematicians from a variety of scientific disciplines
              who are working on duality, Complementarity and symmetry in nonlinear mechanics
              and computational methods. The original proposal of this IUTAM symposium has
              been approved by the IUTAM Symposia Committee with the maximum grade A. The
              purpose of this proposal is to apply for a very limit grant from NSF to cover
              partially the travel expenses for about ten important participants from
              different institutions in US. The symposium proceedings will be published in a
              hardbound volume by Chapman & Hall / CRC in the book series Advances in Modern
              Mechanics and Mathematics. It is expected that this IUTAM Symposium will lead a
              new trend of nonlinear mechanics, and the proceedings will be an important
              IUTAM documentation in the development of this fascinating subject.
