Abstract    :
              The Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics Scholars Program

This
              project is creating an environment for success for academically talented, yet
              disadvantaged engineering, mathematics, and computer science students by
              matching them with an engineer or
scientist to work side by side on a research
              project as well as actively participate in academic and professional
              development activities. Further, each CSEM Scholar has an industrial mentor
              who
works with the scholar for professional development. These activities
              provide
experience and foster confidence in each recipient thereby producing
              better qualified and well-
rounded graduates to enter the workforce or
              graduate school.
