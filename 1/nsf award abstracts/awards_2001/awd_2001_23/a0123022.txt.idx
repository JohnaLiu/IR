Abstract    :
              The CSAM (Computer Science and Mathematics) Scholars program at the College of
              William and Mary annually provides financial and academic assistance to 26
              academically talented, financially needy students who express a desire to
              pursue degrees in mathematics and computer science. Each student is assigned a
              faculty-mentor from the Departments of Mathematics or Computer Science for
              entire degree program. The faculty-mentors are trained by the Offices of
              Academic Advising and Multicultural Affairs. In addition to scholarships, funds
              are also provided for travel, special projects, and summer research. At the end
              of each academic year, an assessment expert from the School of Education
              conducts an analysis of the criteria for selection of CSAM Scholars, their
              success in maintaining the award, and its benefits. A summary of this is used
              for continuation of funding for the students.
