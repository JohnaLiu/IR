Kuhn, Jeffrey

This project is to design, fabricate, build, test
              and integrate an optical system to be placed on the US Air Force AEOS telescope
              system for the purpose of detecting and characterizing circumstellar matter in
              the infrared. The goal is to identify star systems most likely to have
              proto-planetary and planetary systems.  The unique innovation in this proposal
              is the merging of coronagraphic and polarimetric techniques with the adaptive
              optics capabilities of a major telescope.
