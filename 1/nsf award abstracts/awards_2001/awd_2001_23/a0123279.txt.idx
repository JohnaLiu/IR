Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31) This projects provides funding for faculty to participate
              in workshops on the Personal Software Process and the Team Software Process
              leading to enhanced ability to teach these software engineering methodologies
              to undergraduate students. The workshops are a joint activity of Southern
              Polytechnic State University and the Software Engineering Institute of Carnegie
              Mellon University. The funding is used to support faculty who otherwise would
              not be able to attend.
