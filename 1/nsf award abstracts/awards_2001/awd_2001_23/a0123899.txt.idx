Abstract    :
              In recent years, problems in science education in American high schools,
              colleges, and universities have been widely publicized and have aroused great
              concern. In particular, the traditional lecture approach, common in college and
              university introductory science courses, often fails to help students master
              key concepts. Students may learn to follow recipe-like algorithms for solving
              problems, but they lack understanding of some of the most basic ideas. A number
              of strategies have been developed to improve the teaching of these courses,
              several of which can be used in a variety of disciplines. Over the past ten
              years, we have established that one effective way to improve student learning
              in undergraduate science courses is to incorporate cooperative learning
              exercises into otherwise traditional lectures, using a strategy called "Peer
              Instruction"(PI). Use of PI has spread rapidly around the world; many faculty
              tell us that they have found PI both successful in improving their students'
              learning and easy to implement and adapt to their particular contexts. Peer
              Instruction is used widely in physics, chemistry, and astronomy, and
              implementation is beginning in biology, engineering, and mathematics. The goals
              of this project are to make Peer Instruction easier to implement for
              instructors, and to reinforce active learning habits for students in Peer
              Instruction-taught classes, through development of web-based electronic
              resources. Specifically,the project is developing Internet utilities that allow
              instructors to download class-ready materials and to automate production of a
              course web site for courses taught using Peer Instruction. A self-test and
              self-study facility for students is also being developed. These resources aim
              to lower the threshold to implementing Peer Instruction or similar techniques
              to promote cooperative learning.
