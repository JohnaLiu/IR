Abstract    :
              This program provides scholarships to academically talented but financially
              needy students, including those from underrepresented groups, to enable them to
              pursue degrees in computer science, engineering and mathematics. Project
              components include: recruitment; selection; financial assistance; student
              support services including mentoring; and professional development of the
              scholarship recipients, including research and internship opportunities.
              Attention is given to improving students' educational experiences through
              technology utilization, connections to the work environment, improved support
              programs, and strengthening industry partnerships.
