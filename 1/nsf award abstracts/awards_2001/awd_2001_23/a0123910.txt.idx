Abstract    :
              A major trend in day-to-day computing involves moving seamlessly from
              workstation to wireless handheld devices.  A second major trend is continuous
              collaboration with colleagues.  Accommodating and supporting these trends is
              extremely difficult because of the vastly different platforms and communication
              networks.    	The objective of the proposal is to develop and demonstrate a
              middleware framework for performance-optimized ubiquitous collaboration over
              heterogeneous networks.  It will enable quality-of-service applications and
              support selective data distribution.  The key component of the proposed
              framework is the collaboration bus, which is a middleware to support group
              communication in data-centric groupware.  The proposed research includes: a)
              algorithms and methods for dynamic monitoring of network capabilities, b) data
              transformation and adaptation policies for adjusting network traffic, and c)
              assessing and controlling the performance impact involving in broadcasting each
              message.  Some of the key elements of the research are the development of
              Data Adaptation Agents.  These agents transform and change the data so that it
              can be used by different applications and hardware. The proposed research will
              bring new capabilities for multi-user collaboration within reach.
