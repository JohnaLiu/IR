Abstract    :
              This scholarship program serves engineering students with strong academic and
              leadership potential. A pre-college summer program introduces prospective
              students to medical applications of engineering. The orientation program,
              designed and facilitated by student leaders, facilitates academic success and
              social success and assists in identifying support systems in the work setting.
              A team of industry representatives assists in mentoring student employees and
              an e-mail mentor network connects incoming students to graduates of Kettering
              University.
