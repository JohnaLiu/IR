Abstract    :
              Distributed systems are becoming ever more important as they provide information
              support for basic infrastructures such as electrical and telephone service, and
              as a means for corporations to manage worldwide operettas.  They are also
              becoming ubiquitous because many applications demand greater computational
              power and require distributed resources.  The net impact is that a vast amount
              of data needs to be shared across a broad array of users.  The proposal plans
              to investigate the long-term issues of mobility and efficiency in the design of
              scalable middleware for distributed systems.  The effort will include the
              implementation of a distributed middleware for mobile environments.  Specific
              research themes to be pursued are: - formalization and implementation of
              consistency requirements for middleware - algorithms for data placement and
              replication - protocols for support of conflict resolution and the support of
              mobility, and - incorporation of stream data in a computational
              framework.  The results of these investigations will be the development of an
              experimental prototype that uses the researched algorithms and protocols.  In
              order to experiment with the prototype, a number of applications will be
              implemented in a campus environment.   The goal of the research is to help
              guide long-term development of middleware at large scale.
