Abstract    :
                   We propose to develop technologies which will enable communication on a
              single
optical fiber at rates in excess of 100 Tb/s within a few years. To
              accomplish this in the
low-loss window of silica fibers (1200-1700 nm), there
              will be a need for novel very
wideband devices, particularly optical
              amplifiers. In addition, modulation techniques with
spectral efficiencies well
              in excess of unity will be needed. Our research activities will be
centered in
              these two areas.
     We will investigate modulation techniques, and
              associated detection schemes,
suitable to obtain a spectral efficiency of 4
              b/s/Hz by the end of the project. The
techniques will be designed to be
              resistant to impairments due to PMD and fiber
nonlinearities. In particular,
              we will investigate novel techniques using appropriate
combinations of PSK,
              QAM, and polarization-based techniques. Coherent detection will
be utilized
              where indicated to boost spectral efficiency.
We will investigate fiber
              optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) and discrete
Raman amplifiers made from
              novel highly-nonlinear fibers. These fibers will have
nonlinearity
              coefficients exceeding those of today's most nonlinear fibers by
              several
orders of magnitude. These fibers will enable the development of novel
              nonlinear
amplifiers , with gain bandwidth of a single device covering most of
              the 1200-1700 nm
window. These devices will also use shorter fibers and lower
              pump powers than their
current versions, and may thus lead to practical
              applications in a relatively short time.
