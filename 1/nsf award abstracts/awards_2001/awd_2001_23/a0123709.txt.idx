Abstract    :
              Rock Mechanics in Extreme Environments: A Workshop to Explore Applications of
              Rock Mechanics in Challenging Settings will take place on July 7, 2001, as part
              of DC Rocks 2001: The 38th U.S. Rock Mechanics Symposium in Washington, DC. The
              workshop will probe areas of national concern, such as resource development,
              national security, scientific exploration, and building and infrastructure. An
              extreme environment is one in which rock is exposed to a change in its
              environment caused by the activities of humans. The workshop will consist of a
              series of presentations by experts on the unique mechanical and engineering
              properties of rock under extreme environmental conditions, and technologies
              that make it possible to subject rocks to extreme environments. These
              presentations will include research initiatives underway and the problems
              inherent in working under these environmental conditions. After the
              presentations, workshop participants will discuss how the many unknown
              characteristics of rock under extreme conditions can be better understood. How
              can research and technology development help in this quest? 	 Workshop topics
              include rock and rock structures under high dynamic loading, caving method
              mining, difficult rock conditions in the new Transalpine Tunnels, blasting in
              urban environments, stone in architecture, rock as a building material,
              fractured bedrock, and rock mechanics for deep drilling on Mars.     All
              discussion transcripts will be compiled, edited and published in a document
              that will be distributed at no cost through the ARMA Foundation and its Web
              site.
