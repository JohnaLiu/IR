Funds are provided for attendance of thirty NSF funded
              researchers at a joint AFOSR/ONR/NSF grantees meeting in the topic areas of
              surface materials science and engineering and tribology.  The meeting will take
              place in Florida on June 4-8, 2001.  The NSF delegation will include eight
              students and a number of young researchers from underrepresented groups.  The
              delegation members will present oral and poster reports and will participate in
              discussions and panels on potential future research directions.  The abstracts
              of the presentations will be published by the AFOSR subsequent to the
              meeting.
