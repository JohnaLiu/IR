Abstract    :
              The Maryland Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) Program was
              founded in 1976 by the Applied Physics Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins
              University. MESA works to create a superior education process that enables
              American students of African, Latino, and Native American heritage to achieve
              and contribute their full potential in mathematics, engineering, science, and
              technology. The program has shown steady growth since its inception and number
              and the percent of participants going on to enroll in college has steadily
              increased. Maryland MESA currently includes partnerships with colleges and
              universities, business and industry, government, community organizations,
              parents, and more than 143 schools in 15 counties across Maryland. MESA
              activities are multi-faceted and include academic tutorials, Saturday
              academies, field trips, communications skills training, science and engineering
              projects, and advisor workshops. 

The program's success is reflected in the
              84% of the program graduates who go on to college, and the 79% who pursue
              degrees in science, mathematics, or engineering. In the most recent program
              year, 1999-2000, more than 2,200 elementary, middle- and high-school students
              participated, of whom 1,332 (58%) are female, 957 (42%) male; with the ethnic
              distribution of 1,720 (75%) African Americans, 33 Latinos (1.5%), and 11 (.5%)
              Native Americans, as well as 376 (16.5%) Caucasians, 123 (5.5%) Asian
              Americans, and 26 (1%) others. Maryland MESA students also earn higher scores
              on the SAT than the national and state averages.
