Abstract    :
              This program recruits computer science and mathematics students who have
              successfully completed a college-level calculus course, paying particular
              attention to under-represented populations. Each CSEMS scholar is supported for
              up to four years, through completion of the bachelor's degree. CSEMS scholars
              benefit from the South Carolina Alliance for Minority Participation, peer
              supplemental instruction programs and other services in the Center for Student
              Learning, and the strong support for minorities provided by Intercultural
              Programs. Each CSEMS scholar participates in an industry internship, an
              undergraduate research experience, or supplemental instructional leadership.
