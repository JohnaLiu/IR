Abstract    :
              This program is a multi-faceted approach to retain and graduate talented, but
              financially needy, juniors and seniors in mechanical engineering, civil
              engineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, engineering
              administration, computer-aided drafting and design technology, mathematics and
              computer science and to assist them with career placement. The project builds
              on well-established academic support services, a mentoring program, career
              services and placement, established and thriving cooperative education and
              internship programs, and industrial partnerships through industrial advisory
              boards and research projects. The student support structure includes mentoring
              by both faculty and industry representatives through learning communities, as
              well as synchronous and asynchronous on-line conversations among scholars,
              faculty, and industry representatives.
