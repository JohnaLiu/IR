Abstract    :
              This program provides support for students pursuing baccalaureate and graduate
              degrees in electrical and computer engineering or computer science to prepare
              for careers in information science, engineering, and technology. Each ISET
              scholar has a faculty mentor who plays a key role in promoting scholarship and
              career development. Scholars are engaged in the research activities of the
              Center for Advanced Computation and Telecommunications (CACT), the Algorithms
              Laboratory, and other IT Labs at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.
