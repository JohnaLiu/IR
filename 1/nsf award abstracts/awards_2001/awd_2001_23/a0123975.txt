Abstract    :
              This proposal is for partial support of the conference, "New Directions in
              Cluster Supercomputing", being held June 12-14, 2001 in New York City.  The
              conference will examine the impact of low-cost distributed "supercomputing" in
              areas of science and technology and other application areas.  A goal of the
              event is to stimulate the exchange of ideas and examine general approaches and
              techniques, and encourage increased interaction among members of the systems,
              algorithms and natural science applications communities.
The conference will
              run concurrently with the Museum's first major public exhibition on the human
              genome, "The Genomic Revolution."  Support for the conference is also being
              provided by NASA and public sector technology corporations..
