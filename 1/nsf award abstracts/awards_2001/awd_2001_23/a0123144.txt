Abstract    :
              
This project supports undergraduate students in computer science
and
              mathematics through scholarships, mentoring, internships, research
              experience,
conference participation and other activities. The project
              provides four scholarships each
academic year: two for lower division
              students, and two for upper division students.
Scholarships are awarded to
              students with demonstrated financial need on the basis of
academic record,
              professional promise, and character.
Scholarship recipients are encouraged to
              take advantage of various opportunities in the Math and Computer Science
              Departments that will be enhanced by this project. Students obtain professional
              training through internship programs with local high technology companies,
              participation in research with faculty members, and attendance at seminars and
              professional meetings. Scholars receive support and mentoring by faculty, and
              are provided additional activities and mentoring opportunities specially
              designed to meet the needs of female students. Leadership skills are developed
              through community service, teaching assignments (both within the Department and
              in the local area), and administration of the annual mathematics contest for
              high school students. Scholarship recipients are expected to take leadership
              roles in community-building activities sponsored by the Department.
