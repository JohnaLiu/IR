Abstract    :
               Mobility is a primary functionality of next generation computing, and
              intensive work has been done in recent years on mobile agents and mobile
              computing.  However, most of the current successes are based on safe-languages
              such as Java.  While this safe-language approach provides a satisfactory
              solution for many applications, it has inherent limitations, especially for
              technical computing applications which use legacy code such as C, Fortran, or
              C++.  And since most technical computing and applications use these "legacy"
              systems, they will not be able to take advantage of the work that has been done
              on safe-languages such as Java. The proposal plans to develop the High
              Performance Computing Mobility (HPCM) middleware, which will increase the
              mobility of legacy codes written in C, Fortran or C++.  HPCM consists of
              different components including middleware interface, pre-compiler system,
              run-time libraries and so forth.  HPCM can also be used as a low-level layer
              under Java to support mobility of local native codes. HPCM can support complex
              data strutures, heterogenous netework evnironments,  and scalable parallel
              computing.  HPCM is designed to increase the mobility while maintaining the
              high performance of legacy codes. There are a number of research questions
              which the proposal plans to address, and, the success of HPCM will benefit many
              on-going and future research projects.
