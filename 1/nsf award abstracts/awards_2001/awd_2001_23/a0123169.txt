Abstract    :
              This program provides scholarships to talented, low-income students enrolled in
              the Computational Mathematics Program (CMP). The Humacao Research Scholarship
              (HRS) program uses existing programs to recruit high school students and
              provide them with academic support. The program uses undergraduate research as
              a strategy to increase student academic achievement and retention and to
              establish mentorship relations. This strategy has proved to be successful in
              the CMP. A summer bridge program is offered to HRS students admitted from high
              school to the CMP. Another component of the program are workshops, which cover
              topics such as careers in the mathematical sciences and information on graduate
              programs. Faculty coordinate and oversee all activities relating to the
              program.
