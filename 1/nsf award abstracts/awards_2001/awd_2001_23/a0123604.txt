Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to support an expansion of the Women in Science and
              Engineering
(WISE) Project in the Women's and Gender Studies (WGS) Program at
              North Carolina
State University. The WISE project promotes the advancement of
              women and people of
color in science and engineering through the integration
              of women's studies into the
undergraduate and graduate curriculum via faculty
              development seminars. The current
proposal is for two years of funding to
              support companion seminars for interested faculty
and graduate students. The
              immediate goals of the proposed seminar project are to foster
community among
              the participants, address their interests in theory and research from
women's
              studies, and promote informed conversation within science and
              engineering
departments and classrooms. The long-term goals of the proposed
              seminar project are to provide an institutionally sustainable vehicle for the
              recruitment and retention of women and people of color as faculty and graduate
              students in science and engineering, promote the national dialogue about best
              practices in accomplishing this, and contribute new scholarship by and about
              women in science and engineering to
the field of women's studies.

This
              project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the
              ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and
              engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of
              women in academic science and engineering careers.
