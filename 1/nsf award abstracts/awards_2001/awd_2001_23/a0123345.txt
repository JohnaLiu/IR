Abstract    :
              This is a detailed computational analysis of the elementary reaction steps
              leading to the growth of planar and curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
              (PAHs) and subsequently to carbon particles.  Thermodynamic properties are
              computed by means of density functional theory (DFT) using BLYP and B3LYP
              functionals.  Vibrational analysis is performed on the optimized geometries
              followed by determination of entropies and heat capacities.  Uncertainties are
              assessed by comparing the results with higher-level computations using the
              complete basis set (CBS) method.  Kinetic parameters at the high-pressure limit
              are determined by transition-state theory, while pressure dependence of
              chemically activated reactions is analyzed with quantum Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel
              (QRRK) theory.  Competitive reactions of PAH radicals with acetylene, hydrogen,
              oxygen, and hydroxyl are assessed.  The data predictions are incorporated into
              an existing kinetic model and tested for benzene, acetylene, and ethylene
              flames using data previously generated on flame structures in these systems
              including mole-fraction profiles of planar and curved PAHs and fullerenes.
