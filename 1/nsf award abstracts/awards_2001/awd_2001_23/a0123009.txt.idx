Abstract    :
              This program provides scholarships to low-income, academically talented
              students, many from underrepresented groups, to complete associates degrees in
              computer information systems, engineering, and mathematics. In addition to
              expanded and individualized academic support services, the project supports a
              wide range of activities for students, including internships, mentoring and
              research opportunities. There is significant involvement in the program by high
              schools, industry/government, and four-year colleges for recruitment,
              retention, and transfer of students.
