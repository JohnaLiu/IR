Abstract    :
              The investigators will study short period gravity waves using data from a
              clustered set of instruments, including an all-sky imager, a Rayleigh lidar, a
              Doppler interferometer, and a meteor radar.  Short period gravity waves
              oscillations contribute significantly to the dynamics in the 80 to 150 km
              altitude region of Earth's atmosphere.  Several important parameters are
              responsible for wave propagations, such as local temperature and wind velocity.
               Information about these parameters is needed to describe fully and to
              understand more thoroughly the wave propagation conditions.  This study uses
              co-located instruments capable of making such measurements along with data
              analysis and numerical modeling.  The instruments are located in the vicinity
              of the Millstone Hill Observatory in Massachusetts.  The joint measurements
              will be used to investigate the relationship between the occurrence of
              monochromatic gravity waves in the nighttime mesospheric sodium and oxygen
              emissions and the simultaneous temperature and wind structure.  The results are
              important for understanding dynamical processes in the middle atmosphere and
              how they are influenced by the temperature and composition of the atmosphere.
