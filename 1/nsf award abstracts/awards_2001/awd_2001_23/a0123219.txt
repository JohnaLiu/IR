Abstract    :
              The Scholarship Assistance for Technology Students program at Northwest-Shoals
              Community College has the primary goal of inspiring motivation in academically
              talented program participants to complete a college core curriculum and
              graduate with AS degrees in computer science, engineering, or mathematics. The
              Alabama Appalachian area the College serves contains significant numbers of
              needy students from underrepresented groups who are currently enrolled in math,
              engineering, and/or computer science degree and non-degree programs. Students
              are given financial assistance and opportunity to study in these fields,
              graduate with either a two-year terminal degree in these fields or transfer to
              four-year colleges to complete their degrees. A solid foundation of networking
              between the College and local employers is used as a base for mentoring
              scholars and for placing the trained students into a career related to their
              education.
