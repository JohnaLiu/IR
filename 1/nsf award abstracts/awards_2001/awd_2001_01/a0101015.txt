Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include work on
              
relating theoretical predictions to new experiments that will be performed
              
in the near future, and to the development of ideas involving superstring
              
theory, a theory of all fundamental interactions. The detection of dark
              
matter, the mysterious non luminous material that appears to make up about
              
90 % of our Milky Way galaxy, and the the recent exciting Brookhaven
              
National Laboratory measurements that appear to indicate the existance of
              
new physical phenomena will be analyzed,  and a study will be made of how
              
superstring models can account for the masses of elementary particles.
The
              analyses of experimental predictions are of importance as a whole 
array of
              new experiments that will be able to discover the existence of 
new laws of
              physics in the high energy domain have now started or will 
start in the near
              future, and these experiments can be used to test new 
theories of nature and
              determine what these new laws are. The theoretical 
work on superstring theory
              is of importance as this theory is one of the 
main candidates for a new
              theory of all interactions including gravity, as 
well as representing a
              possible fundamental framework for cosmology.
