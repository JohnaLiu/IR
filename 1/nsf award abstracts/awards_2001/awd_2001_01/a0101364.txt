The overall goal of this project is to develop
              flexible 
topological methods which will allow the analysis of data 
which is
              difficult to analyze using classical linear methods. 
Data obtained by
              sampling from highly curved manifolds or 
singular algebraic varieties in
              Euclidean space are typical 
examples where our methods will be useful.  We
              intend to 
develop and refine two pieces of software which have been 
written
              by members of our research group, ISOMAP (Tenenbaum) 
and PLEX (de
              Silva-Carlsson).  ISOMAP is a tool for dimension 
reduction and
              parameterization of high dimensional data sets, 
and PLEX is a homology
              computing tool which we will use in 
locating and analyzing singular points in
              data sets, as well 
as estimating dimension in situations where standard
              methods 
do not work well.  We plan to extend the range of 
applicability of
              both tools, in the case of ISOMAP by 
studying embeddings into spaces with
              non-Euclidean metrics, 
and in the case of PLEX by building in the
              Mayer-Vietoris 
spectral sequence as a tool  Both ISOMAP and PLEX will be
              
adapted for parallel computing. We will also begin the 
theoretical study of
              statistical questions relating to 
topology.  For instance, we will initiate
              the study of 
higher dimensional homology of subsets sampled from 
Euclidean
              space under various sampling hypotheses.  
The key object of study will be the
              family of Cech 
complexes constructed using the distance function in
              
Euclidean space together with a randomly chosen finite 
set of points in
              Euclidean space.  

The goal of this project is to develop tools for
              
understanding data sets which are not easy to understand 
using standard
              methods.  This kind of data might include 
singular points, or might be
              strongly curved.  The 
data is also high dimensional, in the sense that each
              
data point has many coordinates.  For instance, we might 
have a data set
              whose points each of which is an image, 
which has one coordinate for each
              pixel.  Many standard 
tools rely on linear approximations,  which do not work
              
well in strongly curved or singular problems.  The kind 
of tools we have in
              mind are in part topological, in 
the sense that they measure more qualitative
              properties 
of the spaces involved, such as connectedness, or the 
number of
              holes in a space, and so on.  This group of 
methods has the capability of
              recognizing the number 
of parameters required to describe a space, without
              
actually parameterizing it.   These methods also have the 
capability of
              recognizing singular points (like points 
where two non-parallel planes or
              non-parallel lines 
intersect), without actually having to construct
              
coordinates on the space.  We will also be further 
developing and refining
              methods we have already 
constructed which can actually find good
              parameterizations 
for many high dimensional data sets.  Both projects will
              
involve the adaptation for the computer of many methods 
which have
              heretofore been used in by-hand calculations 
for solving theoretical
              problems.  We will also initiate 
the theoretical development of topological
              tools in a setting 
which includes errors and sampling.
