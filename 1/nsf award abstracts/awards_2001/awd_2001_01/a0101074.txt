This award to University of Washington's School of Oceanography
              provides instrumentation to significantly improve the oceanographic research
              capabilities of the research vessels Barnes and Thompson, two ships operated by
              UW as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research
              fleet.  It also provides instrumentation to UW that will be used to support
              scientific operations on USCG Healy, an icebreaker operated by USCG in support
              of NSF-funded Arctic research projects.  The specific items supported with this
              award include an acoustic Doppler current profiler for coastal research on R/V
              Barnes, a plotter, copier and fiber-optic multiplexer for R/V Thompson, and
              deep-sea pingers and cryogenic freezers for research use by scientists on R/V
              Healy.  These improvements will be of substantial advantage to marine
              scientists using these three ships in their research during 2001 and future
              years.
