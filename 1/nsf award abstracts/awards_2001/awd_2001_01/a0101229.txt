Abstract    :
              First introduced as part of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 (and amended by the
              Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 and in the Uruguay Round
              Agreements Acts of 1994, Section 301 provides the opportunity for interested
              parties to charge other nations with unfair trading practices by filing a
              petition with the U.S. Trade Representative's office.  This doctoral
              dissertation research project will constitute a descriptive, explanatory, and
              institutional analyses ofthe  disposition of Section 301 cases since the
              legislation's inception, and it will evaluate both industry and government
              views of the effectiveness of Section 301, not only in terms of the outcomes of
              individual cases, but also in terms of its larger impact on global trade.  By
              examining not only the geographic implications of trade policies as reflected
              in Section 301 cases, this project also will explore the geographic context 
              within which trade policy is developed, enacted, and operationalized.  The
              research will consist of two components.  Descriptive and explanatory analyses
              of  Section 301 cases from 1975 to 2001 will provide the basis for analysis of
              the patterns of Section 301 cases in terms of their evolution over time, the
              countries and regions targeted, the types of "unfair" practices cited, the
              economic sectors involved, the types of complainant, and case outcomes.  These
              descriptive analyses will be augmented by chi-square analyses and refinement of
              a  explanatory multinomial logit model aimed at identifying the factors that
              have influenced the success or failure of Section 301 cases.  The second part
              of the project will consist of interviews with key informants in the USTR's
              office and with three trade associations that have been active in Section 301
              cases.  Emphasis will be placed on identification of the processes that led to
              decisions to file Section 301 petitions and reports, the associations' and the
              USTR's views of the policy, the USTR's selection of cases for prosecution, and
              the interactions between the associations and the USTR.  Archival research will
              complement the semi-structured interviews with staff and officers of the
              associations and the USTR's office.

This project will produce the first
              extensive examination of the geographic, temporal, and sectoral characteristics
              of Section 301 cases as well as the dynamics between those and other
              characteristics.  The project should result in the most comprehensive and
              current analyses of the outcomes of Section 301 cases as well as the
              case-specific and structural factors that explain Section 301 case success. 
              These kinds of analyses should enhance understandings of the ways that trade
              policies like Section 301 affect on the magnitude and direction of trade, then
              we need to know under what conditions those effects are manifested.  The
              project should help clarify what role policies like Section 301 play in the
              larger geography of trade, especially the ways that these policies define what
              constitutes "unfair" practices.  More generally, the project will contribute
              toward broader economic geographic understandings of the ways that
              institutions, policies, and trade interact with each other.  As a Doctoral
              Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support
              to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research
              career.
