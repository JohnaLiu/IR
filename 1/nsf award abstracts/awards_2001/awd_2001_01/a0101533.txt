Abstract    :
              Plasma is a manufacturing medium with unique properties, and its use has led to
              more efficient processes and products that could not be fabricated without
              them. Yet, despite the importance of plasma-aided manufacturing, few community
              colleges currently offer courses and prepare technicians in this critical
              technology. To address this urgent need, the project is developing essential
              resources that will enable community colleges to implement plasma-aided
              manufacturing courses. These resources include outcomes- based instructional
              materials, training systems in plasma technology, and workshops for community
              college faculty. Outcomes-based instructional materials are organized around
              three fundamental components of a plasma processing system. These fundamental
              components include plasma physics, RF power subsystems, and gas delivery
              subsystems. Modules on plasma applications, e.g. plasma etch, chemical vapor
              deposition, and sputtering, integrate the three fundamental components into a
              capstone-type learning experience for students. Laboratory improvement will
              focus on the design of plasma training systems at RF frequencies. Project staff
              are working with equipment suppliers to adapt current manufacturing systems for
              community college laboratories. Finally, faculty enhancement workshops provide
              hands-on opportunities with plasma training systems and disseminate
              instructional materials developed through this project.
