Abstract    :
              The Virtual Molecular Dynamics Laboratory will revise a set of instructional
              materials for virtual chemistry laboratories and provide professional
              development on those materials to 336 high school chemistry teachers. A key
              feature of the materials is the use of molecular dynamics.  Students can see in
              real time, the microscopic behavior and using split-screen software programs
              can simultaneously see the corresponding macroscopic behavior.  By changing the
              system conditions (e.g., the temperature) the student can begin to understand
              both the microscopic and macroscopic properties.  The teachers' professional
              development will focus on using the simulations in their classes, introducing
              the use of cooperative learning as a pedagogical approach to teaching chemistry
              and encouraging the teachers to contribute to their profession by developing
              new activities, approaches, lessons and assessments using the computer as a
              simulator.
