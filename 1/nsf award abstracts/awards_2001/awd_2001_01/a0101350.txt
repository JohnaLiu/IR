Abstract    :
              The investigators will conduct research primarily to enhance understanding of
              solar variability. The main effort is to continue, and indeed to improve, the
              synoptic program of observations at the 150-foot solar tower on Mt. Wilson that
              measures and records the state of solar surface magnetism and dynamics. The sun
              is the dominant source of external variability for the Earth's climate system
              and is the source of space weather. Direct study of the sun is an essential
              part of a program to understand climate change and to monitor and predict the
              state of space weather. This project emphasizes solar magnetism because most
              solar variability is directly influenced by the state of the sun's magnetic
              field. The cause or causes of the twenty-two-year solar magnetic cycle remain
              an elusive problem that prevents addressing variability in a fully satisfactory
              manner. Since the magnetic cycle is of a fully global scale on the solar
              surface, data on all timescales are essential to discover the underlying causes
              of solar variability. Each day the Mt. Wilson Observatory (MWO) program obtains
              up to twenty full disk scans of the sun's magnetic field and velocity field to
              provide a record which can address questions of global solar variability. The
              historical time series of both fields must be sufficiently long to study the
              solar cycle and the 150-foot tower program has provided this history since its
              digital record began in 1967. As part of this project the investigators will
              consider several corrections to the older data and will organize a workshop for
              the intercomparison of the magnetic field data among investigators who now
              regularly obtain full-disk magnetogram and dopplergram records.
