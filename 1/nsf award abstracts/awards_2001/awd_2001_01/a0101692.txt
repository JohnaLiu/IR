Abstract    :
              This project is designing and implementing courses and curricula to produce
              well-qualified computer technicians and Web designers who will serve rural
              northwestern New Mexico--specifically, McKinley County, the Navajo Nation, and
              Zuni Pueblo. Largely by adapting and implementing resources from other
              institutions, the project is developing (1) a new certificate program and
              A.A.S. degree program in computer repair and networking technology and (2) a
              new certificate program and A.A.S. degree program in Internet technology and
              Web design. The student audience is community college students at UNM-Gallup
              and high school students who participate in a dual-enrollment vocational
              program at UNM-Gallup. The project is also offering several workshops on basic
              computer maintenance and Web operations for UNM-Gallup faculty and prospective
              and current high school teachers.

Gallup (population 20,000) is located on
              I-40 in McKinley County, one of the poorest counties in the United States,
              between the Navajo Nation (population 250,000) and Zuni Pueblo (population
              10,000). UNM-Gallup is both a two-year community college and a branch campus
              located 140 miles from the main UNM campus at Albuquerque, with a full-time
              enrollment of approximately 1,500 students, most of whom are Native American.
              Major area employers are local and federal schools, healthcare facilities, and
              governments. Many Native Americans are self-employed craftspeople. Although
              local unemployment is high (8.4% in December 1998), most residents are
              reluctant to leave the area because of historical and cultural ties to the land
              and their families.

According to a Vocational Needs Assessment that surveyed
              students, parents, and employers, UNM-Gallup has a pressing need for a program
              to train technicians to maintain the increasing numbers of computers and
              networks in the college's service area. Skilled applicants are needed for this
              growing job market. This project is a response to the problem. It provides
              local students with the technical education and assistance they need to find
              local jobs, and it also translates into more Native American students seeking
              four-year electrical and computer engineering degrees.
