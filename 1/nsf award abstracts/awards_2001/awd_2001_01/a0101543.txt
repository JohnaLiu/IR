Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to use equivariant methods to study
problems
              concerning algebraic varieties with group actions.  Part
of this project
              involves moment graphs of varieties with torus
actions.  For a variety on
              which a torus acts with finitely many
fixed points and curves, one can define
              a combinatorial object
called a moment graph.  There has been much recent
              progress in
computing topological invariants, such as cohomology
              or
intersection homology, in terms of the moment graph.  The
investigator
              proposes to extend this to K-theory.  Schubert
varieties are among the most
              important varieties with this type of
torus action; the investigator plans to
              continue work with Brian
Boe on a conjecture that would simplify determining
              if a point in
a Schubert variety is rationally smooth.  Moreover, he plans
              to
extend some facts known only for Schubert varieties to the more
general
              setting of varieties with this type of torus action.  In
addition, the
              investigator plans to use equivariant methods to
study certain interesting
              varieties: he plans to calculate
Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes of
              degeneracy loci, and to
calculate interesting invariants (degrees,
              push-forward measures)
of nilpotent adjoint orbits of reductive Lie
              groups.

This project is in the area of mathematics referred to
              as
"algebraic geometry."  Algebraic geometry studies geometric
objects by
              describing them as solutions to polynomial equations
-- such objects are
              called "algebraic varieties."  Fortunately,
although algebraic varieties can
              be very complicated, many of
them have a great deal of symmetry. 
              Mathematicians have been
intensely investigating such varieties with extra
              symmetry for
several reasons:  The presence of such extra symmetry
              makes
these varieties easier to study, so that these varieties are
valuable
              test cases in developing methods to investigate all
varieties. Moreover,
              varieties with extra symmetry are of great
interest in their own right: they
              play important roles in
various areas of mathematics, including number
              theory,
combinatorics, and representation theory. There has been
considerable
              recent progress in developing techniques to
understand these kinds of
              varieties; this project is about
extending these techniques, and using them to
              study particular
classes of varieties.
