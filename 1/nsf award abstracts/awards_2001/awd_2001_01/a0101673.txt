Abstract    :
              This project is a collaboration between Kingsborough Community College and
              Brooklyn College to strengthen the science skills of future K-12 teachers. An
              integrated three-course sequence at Kingsborough Community College features an
              education course with a fieldwork component, an independent study course, and a
              revised Biology course. These courses are engaging preservice teachers in
              inquiry-based science projects with a constructivist approach. The students
              participate in field work at informal science institutions and serve as docents
              working with children under the supervision of a science educator. Kingsborough
              Community College and Brooklyn College faculty are collaborating in the
              development of web-enhanced courses and virtual components of science and
              education courses. An on-line advisement system for transfer students is
              specifically designed to facilitate the transition of prospective teachers into
              the teacher preparation program Brooklyn College. The project includes early
              mentoring by peer tutors and K-12 teachers. The overall goal of "Crossing
              Boundaries" is to expand the pool of qualified teachers and to better prepare
              these teachers to introduce their own students to science and mathematics.
