Abstract    :
                 The project looks at several seemingly unrelated problems from a 
unified
              perspective.  It deals with questions of expansion of Cayley 
graphs of finite
              groups, eigenvalues of Riemannian manifolds and 
pro-p groups.  Somewhat
              unexpectedly, methods and results from one 
field shed a new light on the
              other areas.

    The work is promising to be very interdisciplinary and
              should 
have, if successful, a serious impact on several mathematical fields,
              
pure and applied.  On the pure side, it is expected to have a 
completely
              new approach toward the Thurston conjecture on three-
dimensional manifolds. 
              On the applied side, it will bring a better 
understanding of expanding
              graphs, graphs which serve as basic 
building blocks for various communication
              networks.
