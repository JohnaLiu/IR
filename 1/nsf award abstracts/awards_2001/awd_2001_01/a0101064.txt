Abstract    :
              The investigators will study the role of high latitude Poynting flux in
              large-scale magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.  The principal means by which
              energy is transported from the magnetosphere to the ionosphere is by Poynting
              flux and particle precipitation in the high latitude polar regions.  The
              Poynting flux will be derived by combining magnetometer measurements from the
              Iridium satellites with electric field measurements from the SuperDARN radar
              system.  The study involves three specific objectives: (1) Establish the
              principal regions of electromagnetic energy flux by determining the spatial
              distribution of the Poynting flux; (2)  Identify the influence of the neutral
              wind dynamo by looking for regions of negative Poynting flux; and (3) determine
              correlations between Poynting flux and other magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling
              phenomena.  The combined data set will be used to calculate the global scale
              Poynting flux and energy deposition into the atmosphere.
