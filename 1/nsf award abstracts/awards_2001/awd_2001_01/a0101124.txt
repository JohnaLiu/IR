Abstract    :
              The PI intends to continue the study of singularities of nonlinear
              heat
equations in differential geometry and mathematical physics, such as
              The
Ricci flow, Harmonic Map flow, Mean curvature flow, and the Porous
              medium
equation. Possible singularities will be analyzed by means of
              matched
asymptotic expansions.
    In addition to this the PI hopes to
              continue his collaboration with
groups in medical imaging, serving at least as
              a source of theoretic
knowledge for such groups and perhaps collaborating more
              intensely.

Nonlinear diffusion equations occur in many forms in mathematical
              physics
and engineering, as well as in pure mathematics (differential
              geometry).
Understanding of the solutions to such equations can be gained by
              studying
their singularities. E.g. singularities of a solution to an
              equation
modeling a chemical reaction in a reactor may correspond to explosion
              as
opposed to steady reaction. The PI intends to study such singularities.
  
               In addition, the PI intends to continue his collaboration with a
research
              group in Medical Imaging. The practical problems of how to
automatically
              process 3D fMRI images all belong to a branch of mathematics
called
              differential geometry. A detailed knowledge of differential geometry
has
              proved to be very useful in medical imaging in the past, and promisses
to stay
              important. Conversely, medical imaging problems may serve as a
source of new
              mathematical problems and theories.
