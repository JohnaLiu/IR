This award to University of California at San Diego will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use by the Oceanographic Data
              Facility of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, as well as specific
              instruments for use on the four research vessels operated by the institution,
              R/Vs Revelle, Melville, New Horizon and Sproul.  All four of these research
              vessels are operated by the university as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific instrumentation to be
              acquired includes new meteorological sensors for underway data acquisition, new
              transmissometers, thermometers and altimeters for use with CTD systems, new
              servers for shipboard computer networks, a replacement GPS system for attitude
              and speed data acquisition, and a grab sampler and deep ocean pinger.  The
              shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist marine scientists conduct
              studies worldwide on SIO and other research vessels during 2001 and future
              years.
