Abstract    :
              This project is presenting a team of community college students, four-year
              college students, and technical high school students with a real marine
              engineering problem to be solved over the course of a one-semester elective
              laboratory engineering course. The four-year college students are acting at the
              project engineers; the community college students are acting as a commercial
              laboratory testing facility; and the high school students are the engineering
              technicians. The project being presented to the students involves the
              development of an underwater marking applicator which can be operated by the
              grappling arm of the submersible vessel ALVIN. When this vessel is on an
              undersea geophysics mission, there is a need for making markings or attaching
              tags to rocks of geophysical interest. Participation in a technical project of
              this nature is providing the students with experiences that enhance their
              technical knowledge and abilities. Institutions involved in this project are
              Upper Cape Cod Regional Technical High School, Bristol Community College, and
              the Massachusetts Maritime Academy in partnership with the Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution.
