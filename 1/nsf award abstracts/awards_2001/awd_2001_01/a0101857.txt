Abstract    :
              Submitted under the guidelines for Teacher Retention and Renewal, this 49-month
              project is "designed to develop a cadre of teachers, leaders, supervisors and
              collegiate mathematics educators who will act as change agents responsible for
              implementing standards-based high school mathematics reform" [project summary].
               More specifically, the project provides (a) comprehensive professional
              development for 256 high school teachers in Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin so
              they can effectively implement national goals for standards-based mathematics
              education through implementation of the Core-Plus instructional materials in
              their classrooms; (b) leadership development for 16 master teachers who are
              experienced with Core-Plus; (c) leadership development, structured workshop and
              classroom observation, and preservice or inservice leadership experience for
              eight college professors and eight school mathematics curriculum supervisors;
              and (d) experiences for participants to work with all stakeholders, such as
              parents and administrators, on behalf of standards-based renewal of school
              mathematics education.  The project's teacher-participants engage in
              professional development in two cadres, each for two years, for at least six
              weeks over the life of the project; university/college professors and school
              mathematics supervisors participate for approximately four weeks.
