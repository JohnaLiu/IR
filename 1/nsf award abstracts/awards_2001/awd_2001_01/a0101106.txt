Abstract    :
              At the end of 1997, there were stock markets in 103 different countries, and 48
              were established between 1988 and 1997.  Some of these new stock markets appear
              similar to those established elsewhere, but others involve substantial local
              control and have special characteristics.  What explains the proliferation of
              these stock markets, and the different forms they can take in different
              countries?  Four theories provide competing answers to these questions.  First,
              a 'strong' theory of global change suggests that states are increasingly
              powerless against homogenizing global economic forces.  Second, a 'hollowing
              out' theory predicts that global markets weaken and constrain rather than
              destroy state capacity, and leave room for local control of markets.  Third, a
              'skeptical' theory argues that states actively participate to varying degrees
              with international economic forces, produce diverse national institutions, and
              allow for considerable local control of markets.  Fourth, a 'world culture'
              theory explains increasing similarity across nations through the international
              diffusion of organizational norms. 

This project -- the third phase of a
              larger study of recently-created stock markets -- examines these questions and
              evaluates these theories through the study of new stock markets in Fiji, Ghana,
              and Iceland.  It uses methods of participant-observation, in-depth interviews
              with market participants, and archival analysis to test predictions about the
              global economy and state power in affecting the establishment and operation of
              new stock market exchanges.  In particular, the study describes and analyzes
              the sources and types of information market participants draw on, the
              connections of the market to international organizations, and local and
              regional dynamics in market practices.
