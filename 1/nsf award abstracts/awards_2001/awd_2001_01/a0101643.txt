Abstract    :
              A consortium of four community colleges and their associated high performance
              computing laboratories are studying the need for technician support for these
              laboratories. High performance computing is the use of a networked group of
              computer processors that perform complex computational operations in parallel.
              In this project, a survey is being developed, distributed, and analyzed to
              determine the demand for technicians and the skills they need. A national
              advisory board composed of representatives from industry, academia and
              government are guiding the project. The colleges involved are University of
              Hawaii/Maui, Wake Technical College, Contra Costa College, and Pellissippi
              State Technical Community College. The high performance computing partners
              include Maui High Performance Computing Center, Oak Ridge, Lawrence Berkeley
              and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, and the North Carolina
              Supercomputing Center.
