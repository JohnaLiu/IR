Abstract    :
              The goal of the four-year project is to revitalize and retain grades 3-8
              teachers of the physical and space sciences, and in so doing improve the
              instructional quality and increase the overall quantity of these sciences for
              students.  The collaborative effort, to further teacher retention and renewal
              nationwide, is managed by the Science Education Department (SED) at Harvard
              College Observatory and the McAuliffe/Challenger Center Learning Center (MCLC)
              at Framingham State College (FSC).  The aim is to build on the pilot SEDNet
              project, which was an exploratory effort designed to revitalize and retain
              grades 3-8 teachers of the physical and space sciences, and in so doing improve
              the instructional quality and increase the overall quantity of these sciences
              for students. 

Three person teams from16 Challenger Learning Centers (CLC's)
              attend two, two-week SEDNet summer institutes in alternate years for in-depth
              professional development on inquiry science embedded in the physical science
              concepts that form the basis of the ARIES modules.  These team leaders then
              provide (at their own locale) fee-based implementation workshops, which support
              teachers using ARIES modules with elementary and middle school students.
              

Built in sustained support for teachers will include CLC-based focus
              meetings, distance learning opportunities and Web-site support.  Over time the
              SEDNet programming will be self-sustaining.  
Evaluation includes summative
              pre/post test measures to assess changes in science content knowledge of both
              team leaders and second-tier teachers and some comparison testing of students
              in schools.
