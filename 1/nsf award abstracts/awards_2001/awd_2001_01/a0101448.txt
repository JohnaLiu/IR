Abstract    :
              This award will support preparing, carrying out, and analyzing a
series of
              measurements of electromagnetic structure of matter by the
University of
              Massachusetts Group, primarily at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center
              (SLAC) and for conducting a program of graduate
and undergraduate education in
              experimental high energy nuclear
physics.  This work has as a common thread
              the use of high energy
(sometimes polarized) electrons and gamma rays to probe
              matter. A
major area of work will be the data runs, analysis, and
              publications
for SLAC Experiment E158 that will use the SLAC high
              intensity
polarized electron beam and a new dedicated spectrometer
              and
detector system to measure parity violating asymmetry
              in
electron-electron scattering.  This high precision data will
              provide
important tests of the Standard Model of matter at low
              momentum
transfer in the electromagnetic coupling via the
              interference
between exchange of virtual photons and Z bosons. The UMass
              Group
has contributed to the design of the spectrometer and
              beamline
instrumentation, to the calibration systems, and to
              implementation
of the data acquisition system.  The UMass Group is taking a
              leading
role in developing a new high intensity, high
              energy
quasi-monoenergic polarized photon beam facility to be build at
              SLAC
for a program of experiments: 1) to measure the high energy
contribution
              to the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule 2) to measure the
nuclear dependence of
              the photoproduction of charmed mesons and 3)
to measure the gluon spin
              distribution using polarized
photoproduction of charmed mesons.
