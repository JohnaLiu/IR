              Project Title: K-theory of  operator algebras and its
 applications to 
              topology of manifolds 

Principal Investigator: Guoliang Yu 


Abstract:
              The investigator  proposes to study the K-theory 
of operator algebras
              associated to metric spaces and groups, and its 
applications to topology of
              manifolds. The K-theory of such  
operator algebras are receptacles of higher
              indices of elliptic  
differential operators and have  important applications
              to problems 
in differential geometry and topology of manifolds such as 
the
              existence problem for Riemannian metrics with positive
scalar curvature, the
              Novikov conjecture on homotopy invariance of
higher signatures. The methods to
              be employed include 
controlled operator K-theory, infinite dimensional almost
              flat bundles, 
and geometric group theory. 

Manifolds are spaces glued
              together by Euclidean spaces. Examples 
of manifolds include spheres and tori.
              In differential geometry  
one studies how  manifolds are  curved. For example
              a flat piece of 
paper has zero curvature while the sphere has positive
              curvature. 
This is why we can not bend a piece of paper into a sphere.  A
              basic
problem in differential geometry is to determine when a manifold 
can
              have positive scalar curvature. Another  important problem in 
mathematics is
              the classification of  manifolds. By surgery theory 
the classification
              problem for higher dimensional manifolds  
can be essentially  reduced to  the
              Novikov conjecture. The K-theoretic 
higher indices of certain elliptic
              differential operators can be used
to attack the positive scalar curvature
              problem and the Novikov 
conjecture. A key step in this analytic approach is
              the computation 
of the K-theoretic higher indices, which can be
              essentially
reduced to the problem of computing the K-theory of operator
              algebras 
associated to metric spaces and groups.
