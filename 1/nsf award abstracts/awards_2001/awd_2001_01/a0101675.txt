Abstract    :
              	 
This project is focussing on professional development of middle school
              science, mathematics and technology teachers. These middle school teachers are
              (a) receiving technology training (b) interning with Cleveland State faculty on
              real world science, mathematics, engineering, and technology projects, (c)
              attending follow-up content and pedagogy workshops, (d) implementing Middle
              School ATE professional development materials with their students, and (e)
              leading a year-long engineering challenge activity.

Concurrent with
              professional development efforts are curriculum development, the focus being to
              develop or adapt curriculum from prior ATE projects for a middle school
              audience, and to prepare materials that can be disseminated to institutions
              that prepare middle school teachers. The project is a collaboration between the
              Advanced Manufacturing Center (AMC) at Cleveland State University, Cuyahoga
              Community College, and Lorain Community College. Other partners include the
              Cleveland Municipal School District (CMSD), and CAMP Inc, a non-profit
              organization.
