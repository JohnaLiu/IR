Abstract    :
              This project is establishing a collaboration, called Project Sun, among Brevard
              Community College (BCC), the Florida Solar Energy Center, Brevard Public
              Schools, the University of Central Florida, and the Astronauts Memorial
              Foundation. It increases the number and diversity of prospective K-12 teachers
              at BCC by providing opportunities to improve technological literacy, strengthen
              science and mathematics preparation, transfer seamlessly to a four-year
              program, and connect with business and industry. 

The objectives of the
              project are to:
(a) improve the technological literacy of 150 pre- and
              in-service teachers by providing them an opportunity to learn technology
              applications in a hands-on workshop called the Sun Academy.
(b) increase the
              knowledge of these pre- and in-service teachers about the use of workplace
              technologies in the classroom through follow-up learning opportunities during
              the academic year.
(c) increase by 10% the number of prospective K-12 teacher
              enrolling in the community college while also increasing diversity.
(d)
              facilitate a smooth and seamless transition for community college students to
              four-year teacher preparation programs through articulation
              partnerships.

During the academic year, participants work in elementary
              school classrooms, evaluating how students learn from Solar Matters, an online
              solar energy curriculum unit, and the Sun Kids Website. An Inquiry Group is
              forming an online discussion group, developing mentoring relationships, posting
              lessons and observations to the Website, and meeting annually to review the
              effectiveness of student learning. Participants also visit the Florida Solar
              Energy Center and the University of Central Florida Instructional Technology
              Resource Center.
