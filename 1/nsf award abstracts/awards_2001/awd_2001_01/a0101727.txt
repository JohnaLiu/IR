Abstract    :
              This project (Minority Engineering Transfer and Articulation Program - META) is
              a joint effort by Santa Fe Community College, New Mexico State University, the
              New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department, and three civil
              engineering firms. It supplements the New Mexico Alliance for Minority
              Participation (AMP). META's goals are to provide a connected and coordinated
              educational pathway from associate's degree programs in engineering technology
              to bachelor's degree programs in civil engineering and to create instructional
              materials that emphasize technology applications in civil engineering. The
              summer bridge program includes an industry-sponsored design project, a new
              technology course, guidance workshops and seminars. There are also summer
              internships, industry sponsored tuition and book scholarships, faculty
              development seminars and workshops, comprehensive student advising, and
              multi-level recruitment strategy. It addresses minority issues and updates an
              outdated Civil Engineering curriculum.
