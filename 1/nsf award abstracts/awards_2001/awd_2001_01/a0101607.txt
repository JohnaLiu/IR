Abstract    :
              						 
This project is (a) providing students the technical background and
              information they need to choose the dual enrollment option to attend the
              community college and to receive college credit while still in high school, (b)
              enabling substantial numbers of high school students to take college courses
              beyond a prescribed introductory course, (c) preparing students to matriculate
              to one of the community college's Engineering Technology programs, (d) allowing
              selected students to enroll in Miami University's two plus two bachelor's
              degree program being offered by distance on the community college campus, and
              (e) graduating an estimated 50 students as skilled engineering technologists
              with associate degrees. The project includes enhancement of the curriculum at
              the high schools, through the development of new courses and the infusion of
              SMET content in grades 11-12 coursework. TEAM (Technology, Engineering and
              Manufacturing) academies are being organized in the high schools with the
              collaboration of the partners. Ultimately, the project is demonstrating a
              workable pipeline in which students flow through from the high school, through
              the community college, into four-year college, into technician careers or
              engineering careers. Partners include two inner city high schools (Columbus
              East High and Marion Franklin High) and Miami University.
