Abstract    :
              This project is a teacher development program that builds on three projects, the
              "Virtual Solar System Project", the "Virtual Exploratorium," and the "Virtual
              Gorilla Modeling Project."  While featuring modeling enriched inquiry-based
              learning environments, the project develops and evaluates a model for changing
              teaching practice as teachers incorporate the extensive use of these
              technologies.  The PIs use a four-phase process to help 90 middle school
              teachers make the transition.  In the first two years of the project, teachers
              begin their apprenticeship with a one-week intensive workshop on science,
              pedagogy and technology.  This is followed by one or two weeks working in one
              of three summer camps (at the Georgia Outreach Program or the Zoo).  The third
              phase involves digital video and reflections with a follow up one-day seminar. 
              In the final phase, teachers build their own communities, hold local workshops
              (1-2 hours) and do outreach presentations.  Subcontracts are to the Atlanta Zoo
              and to EDC (Honey et al) for evaluation, which is quite thorough and consistent
              with PDET.  Included are three doctoral students.
