Abstract    :
              The applied research project builds on the IMD funded "Where are We?" and poses
              the following research questions:  

Do students perform significantly better
              on real-world map tasks after using WAW?
What specific misconceptions and
              weaknesses remain widespread among students after using the materials? How much
              improvement in student performance on map skills tasks would be expected after
              using the curriculum? 
How can teachers tell whether student learning has
              occurred?
What is the relationship between teachers' spatial abilities and the
              likelihood they would use the materials?

The project will develop
              quantitative, reliable field-based assessments of map skills and use them,
              along with other instruments, with three populations:  elementary students
              using the materials; children over the 7-15 age range who do not uses the
              materials; and preservice elementary teachers.  Results from these assessments
              will be used in a redesign of the materials.
