Abstract    :
              
Cataret Community College and North Carolina State University are leading a
              collaborative effort for articulation between a two-year college and a
              four-year institution for technician education and teacher preparation. The
              three goals are (1) improving curricular coherence between community college
              and upper division courses of study, (2) increasing the retention and success
              of community college students after transfer, and (3) providing comprehensive
              professional development activities for university, community college, and
              secondary school science and mathematics faculty.
