Abstract    :
              This project involves studies of tropical cyclogenesis and development along
              three avenues.  Previous work by the PI and his group advanced the
              understanding of the axisymmetrization for vortices where the mean vortex
              intensifies at the expense of the small-scale vorticity anomalies through an
              upscale energy cascade process using a fairly simple model.  As the first
              avenue of investigation, the PI will further explore the validity of the theory
              using a more realistic three-dimensional cloud-resolving model under various
              initial conditions.  The second avenue is to examine and determine the
              conditions for the disruptions of the upscale energy cascade.  If a barotropic
              vortex is tilted from its rotation axis, it may or may not return to its
              upright position (alignment) and disrupt the upscale energy cascade.  This work
              seeks to determine the conditions that enable a finite Rossby number vortex to
              resist the adverse effects of vertical shear.  The third avenue will be the
              testing of the theory using the airborne Doppler-radar data from a tropical
              cyclone field experiment done in 1991.  This part of the work will be done in
              collaboration with Drs. Frank Mark and Paul Reasor of HRD and Prof. Lance
              Bosart of SUNY/Albany.  The results of this project have the potential to
              enhance the understanding of tropical cyclogenesis and to improve the
              prediction of tropical cyclone intensity.
