Abstract    :
              This proposal describes planned activities that will build a strong, ongoing
              relationship between the Physics Department at Southern University (SU) in
              Baton Rouge, LA and the LIGO Laboratory.  The program has two major components:
              first, the study of impurities in materials of interest to LIGO for advanced
              detector optics; and second, an educational and research program for SU
              students together with an outreach program in collaboration with the LIGO
              Livingston Observatory (LLO) to inform and educate students of all ages about
              basic science in general, and the LIGO search for gravity waves in particular. 
              In addition, the proposal looks forward to an interesting analysis program to
              correlate gamma ray bursts (observed for a number of years, but still not
              understood) with gravity waves that LIGO expects to observe when the LIGO
              upgrade is completed. The proximity of LLO to the SU campus ( it is about 50
              miles from SU) greatly enhances the outreach program since students will have
              access to research projects at LLO while they are enrolled in classes at SU.
