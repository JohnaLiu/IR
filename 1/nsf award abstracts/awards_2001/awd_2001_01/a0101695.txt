Abstract    :
              
Los Angeles County, the largest urban manufacturing area in the United States,
              currently has a labor crisis in durable manufacturing that threatens to inhibit
              the growth of the local economy. At a time when the metal manufacturing
              industry is experiencing a growing demand for skilled employees, industrial and
              technical education in the state is in crisis due to lack of qualified
              instructors and support from districts. Well-educated machinists are critical
              to the continued success of manufacturing in the region. To address these
              issues, Los Angeles Trade-Technical College and the Small Manufacturers'
              Association in collaboration with the National Institute for Metalworking
              Skills are in the planning stages of establishing a Regional Center for
              Manufacturing Education with the goal of developing a model for the systemic
              reform of industrial education. Validating skills through nationally accepted
              standards is at the core of the mission and is facilitating articulation along
              a career pathway to stimulate the development of a well educated workforce. The
              ultimate goal is to support the growth of durable manufacturing in the southern
              California region.
