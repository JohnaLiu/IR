Abstract    :
              Dr. Paul R. Sharp, Department of Chemistry, University of Missouri at Columbia,
              is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
              program of the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work
              on the organometallic chemistry at the edge of polycyclic aromatic carbon
              compounds. Specifically, the chemistry of polycyclic aromatic yne and
              metallacycle complexes will be developed as a means to construct carbon
              nanotubes by a step-growth approach based on permetalated naphthalenes,
              coronenes, and coroannulenes. 

Carbon nanotubes will be constructed by
              special design at the molecular level. These nanotubes will provide other
              researchers opportunities to explore novel electronic properties of
              one-dimensional conducting systems. They will also find applications in such
              areas as nanoscale electronic devices, field emitters, hydrogen storage, and
              non-linear optics. Graduate students and post-doctoral associates will receive
              enviable training from the molecular scale chemistry to the nanoscale
              dimension.
