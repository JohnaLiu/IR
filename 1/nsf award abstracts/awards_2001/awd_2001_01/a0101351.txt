Abstract    :
              This project will extend the results of the PI's previous model for energetic
              electrons at geosynchronous orbit to cover the entire inner magnetosphere from
              3-10 R.  It will also determine the physical basis of the correlation between
              the solar wind speed and electron flux enhancements.  The magnetic storm events
              chosen for detailed study by the Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) program
              campaign on the Inner Magnetosphere and Storms will be used to compare the
              results of the modeling effort to the measured data.  Particular emphasis will
              be placed on the question of whether the transport and energization of the
              electrons can be accounted for as a result of diffusion or whether other
              mechanisms are required.
