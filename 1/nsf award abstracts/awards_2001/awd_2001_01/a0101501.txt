Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the study of the transverse dynamics of a
              nearly-confocal nonlinear Fabry-Perot ring resonator, using a rubidium vapor
              cell placed in the resonator as a Kerr medium.  Coupling by four-wave mixing of
              the transverse modes is predicted to produce a transverse cavity mode spectrum
              consisting of a central spike corresponding to the lowest on-axis TEM-00 mode,
              on top of a low pedestal of higher modes.  The similarity of this transverse
              mode spectrum to the central spike formed by bosons in the momentum space
              distribution when they undergo Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) suggests that
              these phenomena can also be understood by an analogy to BEC.   Extending this
              analogy, the group will attempt to observe a BEC-like phase transition in which
              the well-collimated output beam corresponding to the central-spike momentum
              spectrum suddenly becomes uncollimated as a random modulation of the input
              laser light by crossed AOMs is increased beyond a certain critical
              amplitude.
