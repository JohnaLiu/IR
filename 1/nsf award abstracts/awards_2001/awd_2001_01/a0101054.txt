Abstract    :
              This project contributes to the literature on downward mobility in the United
              States through a series of in-depth interviews.  Although upward mobility
              remains more common than downward mobility, important economic changes have
              made downward mobility more prevalent in recent decades than during the 1950s
              and 1960s.  This makes the experience of doing worse economically than one's
              parents increasingly common.  However, little is known about how people explain
              and interpret the experience of downward mobility.  In addressing this gap, the
              project builds on studies of class and inequality in the United States,
              improves our understanding of cultural messages about success, and addresses
              issues crucial to Americans.

The methods involve interviews with 100
              respondents from the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut metropolitan area who
              belonged to their high school's class of 1976.  Using an initial survey
              instrument based on a four-category occupational scheme, the project identifies
              50 downwardly mobile respondents, and 25 upwardly mobile and 25 immobile
              respondents who serve as control groups.  The in-depth interviews gauge how
              individuals who differ by race, class, and gender view their experiences with
              downward mobility.  They also reflect the extent and nature of the social
              psychological effects of downward mobility.
