Abstract    :
              The College of Technology (COT) is developing courses in two ATE concentrations
              - Telecommunications and Manufacturing. Each ATE concentration consists of four
              elective courses, allowing students to enroll in all the concentration's
              elective courses during the regular course of study. This NSF ATE project
              enables the COT to develop and refine four courses in information technology
              and polymers and composites. Both of these ATE elective sequences are being
              co-developed with strong business and industry partners. The COT is also
              designing and testing distance learning strategies for these newly developed
              elective courses. Teacher and faculty enhancement workshops are being offered
              to high school math, science and technology teachers and to two-year and
              four-year ATE faculty. These professional development opportunities illustrate
              new teaching and learning approaches related to the specific industry-based ATE
              topics. In addition, technical experiences in industry are available for COT
              faculty, four-year ATE post-secondary faculty and high school technology
              teachers. The Connecticut Community College System, the COT, and the
              Connecticut Business and Industry Association cooperate to offer these
              technical experiences.
