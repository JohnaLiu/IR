We will carry out studies in single crystal silicon to find
              how the speed of a rapidly running crack depends upon loading magnitude,
              loading mode, crystal plane, orientation, and temperature. The studies will
              include the first investigations of crystalline fracture at temperatures below
              100K. We will also provide careful measurements of the structures left behind
              the cracks, both on and below the fracture surface. In addition, we will
              investigate the brittle-ductile transition for polymers, glasses, ionic
              crystals, and alloys, and study the laws governing crack paths in crystalline
              and amorphous materials.

When airplanes or bridges fail, the culprit is
              often fracture. Cracks race across solid structures near the speed of sound,
              ripping them in two. At the same time, fracture underlies many processes used
              to shape materials, such as cutting, sanding, or polishing. The first
              motivation to study fracture is therefore to protect engineering structures,
              and the second is to learn new ways to manipulate and form them. We have been
              constructing experiments to obtain detailed information on how fracture
              proceeds under precisely controlled conditions. Our experiments will be
              performed in single crystals of silicon at temperatures that are 200 degrees C
              below room temperature. The information from these experiments will tell us how
              the structure of matter at the atomic scale affects fracture, and will test
              theories claiming to make predictions about 
possible atomic effects. As the
              experiments in silicon are completed, we will broaden our studies to
              investigate crack motion in other crystalline and glassy materials.
