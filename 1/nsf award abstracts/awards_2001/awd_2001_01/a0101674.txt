Abstract    :
              Westark College fosters the development of work relevant curricula and
              instructional materials in information technology (IT) that are competency
              based and integrate general education throughout. The curricula in essential IT
              clusters, based on various standards documents, consist of building blocks that
              provide graduates with meaningful skills tied to industry established
              competencies, including third-party certificates at credible exit points. The
              instructional delivery system supports both traditional on campus students and
              place bound students and employees in the workplace. The curricula of the
              Center articulate with existing high school and tech prep programs and also
              with four-year programs to shorten the time to employment. The Center provides
              faculty development opportunities.
