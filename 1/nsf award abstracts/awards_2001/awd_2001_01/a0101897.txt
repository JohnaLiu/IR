Abstract    :
              Under prior grants from the National Science Foundation, Education Development
              Center (EDC) has developed two year-long courses, called "Lenses on Learning: 
              A New Focus on Mathematics and School Leadership," and "Lenses on Learning: 
              Classroom Observation and Teacher Supervision," that provide school and
              district administrators with the opportunity to explore new ideas about
              mathematics, learning and teaching; to think critically about the nature of
              mathematics instruction; and to think through the implications of these ideas
              for how they support teachers and standards-based instruction.  

Building on
              previous work, this project ensures the availability of highly qualified Lenses
              on Learning facilitators on a national scale.  Professional associations in
              mathematics and school administration, state departments of education,
              state-wide principal's academies, regional consortia for mathematics and
              science, and large school districts are project partners key to national
              dissemination efforts. 

Facilitator Institutes will provide prospective
              facilitators with the orientation and skills they need to teach either Lenses
              on Learning course.  In the years 2001-2002, 2002-2003, and 2003-2004  EDC will
              offer year-long Facilitators Institutes, each consisting of a two-week
              residential summer program, on-line support during the following academic year,
              and two three-day retreats during the academic year.  EDC also will offer
              facilitators an Advanced Institute.  Participating organizations and districts
              are required to teach Lenses on Learning courses in their home sites in the
              year(s) following their participation in the Institute.
