Abstract    :
              The project will improve our understanding of the genesis and evolution of
              tropical synoptic disturbances in the northwest sector of the Pacific. The
              structure of the background monsoonal flow in this region during northern
              summer (with westerlies in the western and easterlies in the eastern part of
              domain) allows for interesting dynamical interactions involving tropical waves
              and cyclones. Dr. Chang will investigate the dynamical processes, particularly,
              nonlinear interactions in the vicinity of confluent mean flow, to advance the
              understanding of tropical cyclogenesis. Tropical cyclones in this region are
              often disastrous, taking tremendous toll on human lives and the economies of
              Southeast Asia. Investigation of the conditions under which tropical synoptic
              disturbances evolve into cyclones can lead to improvement in cyclone
              forecasting. Together with co-PI, Dr. Roger Williams, Dr. Chang will
              dynamically model the interactions between the background monsoonal flow and
              tropical disturbances using barotropic, baroclinic, and primitive equation
              models, to better understand their evolution.
