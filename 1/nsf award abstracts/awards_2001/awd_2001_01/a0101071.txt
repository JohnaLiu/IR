Abstract    :
              This award provides funds, through Kenyon College,  for an REU Site in
              archaeology and cultural anthropology  at the Lower Cacaulapa Project in NW
              Honduras.  Eight students will conduct independent field investigations
              supported by in-field class instruction and a living and working situation. 
              Participants will take a common core of seminars that introduce them to
              archaeological and ethnographic methods and theory and sensitize them to the
              political, cultural, and economic context in which they live and work.  Student
              investigations will include explorations of modern and ancient cultural
              processes and behavioral patterns.  This course of study is founded on the
              directors' considerable experience in collaborating with and teaching
              undergraduates within field settings in the past, most particularly on NSF REU
              Site projects that they directed in the Naco vally, Honduras in 1988, 1990,
              1992, 1995, and 1996, and in the lower Cacaulapa valley during 2000.

This
              award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented
              students into careers in science through active undergraduate research
              experiences.
