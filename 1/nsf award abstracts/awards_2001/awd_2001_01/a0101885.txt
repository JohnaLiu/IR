Abstract    :
              

The proposal provides travel expenses for US researchers to 
participate in
              a DELOS workshop on "Information Seeking, Searching, 
and Querying in Digital
              Libraries" to be held in Zurich, Switzerland 
December 11-12, 2000.  DELOS is
              a major forum for and organizer of 
digital libraries research and planning
              activities in Europe.  It is 
funded by the Information Societies Technologies
              (IST) 5th Framework 
Programme of the European Commission.

The workshop
              continues the planning and research agenda put forward 
by the multi-year
              NSF-EU working groups' process jointly sponsored by 
CISE/IIS, SBE/INT and the
              European Union.  In the groups' final 
report "An International Research
              Agenda for Digital Libraries", 
increased levels of collaboration and
              interaction was seen as 
critical to building multi-lingual, multi-national
              digital libraries.
