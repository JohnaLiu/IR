Abstract    :
              The Center for Nondestructive Evaluation and six community colleges form a
              dissemination focal point to enhance the education of technical workers in the
              fields of nondestructive testing/nondestructive evaluation (NDT/NDE). The
              project builds upon previous projects that developed simulations in ultrasonic
              detection. Education for NDT/NDE is fragmented, taking place in various
              technological studies. The focal point provides a website that informs high
              school and community college faculty and students about the knowledge and
              skills required for jobs in NDT/NDE. This website brings standards, skills,
              curricula, materials and job information together materials in one place. The
              materials can be used in related technology programs such as manufacturing,
              welding, airframe, power plant and chemical processing. The project also
              provides opportunities for faculty development and student awareness.
