Abstract    :
              This project provides opportunities for high school and two-year college
              students to gain workplace readiness and safety skills in a chemistry context
              through integrated learning experiences based on national science standards.
              The project aims to: (1) create standards-based college and high school
              resource materials that provide contextual integration of chemistry content
              with workplace readiness and safety skills and that are aligned with the
              National Science Education standards; (2) provide professional development
              courses for college and high school educators that enhance their knowledge of
              industrial uses of chemistry and standard operating practices used in the
              chemistry-based workplace; and (3) create an infrastructure of local and
              national support for developing and sustaining new local partnerships among
              high school chemistry teachers, two-year college chemistry and chemical
              technology faculty, and workplace specialists (technicians, process operators,
              scientists, and management). The following outcomes are anticipated: chemical
              technology courses and supporting materials; high school lessons which are to
              be developed, piloted, field-tested, and disseminated; professional development
              courses for high school chemistry and college chemistry and chemical technology
              educators; improvements in high school and two-year college student learning as
              documented by appropriate assessment protocols; and improvement in students'
              critical thinking skills.
