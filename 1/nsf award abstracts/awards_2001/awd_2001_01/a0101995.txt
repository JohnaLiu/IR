Abstract    :
              This project is a five-year leadership development project in mathematics
              educaton that addresses the need to retain qualified mathematics teachers in
              the profession.  The primary goal is to keep competent beginning and
              experienced K-12 teachers in the profession while increasing their ability to
              teach mathematics effectively.  The project is based at the University of
              Califonria, Santa Barbara, and involves teachers and districts in Ventura and
              Santa Barbara counties.  In Project RENEW, two cohorts of 30 experienced
              teachers will received 36 days of professional development over a three-year
              period.  These teachers, called preceptors, will increase their knowledge of
              mathematics and mathematics pedagogy, develop their leadership capabilities,
              and develop and implement strategies to mentor three to five beginning teachers
              for a period of three years.  The plan is to involve the two cohorts of 30
              teachers with two cohorts of 120 beginning teachers for a total of 300
              teachers.  A resource manual for devloping teacher leadership for mentoring
              beginning teachers will be developed.
