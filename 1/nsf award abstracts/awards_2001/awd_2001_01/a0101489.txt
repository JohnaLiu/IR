Abstract    :
              This is a project to build upon an earlier NSF funded program Project TEACH I
              that focused on pre-service education. It is a collaborative effort of the
              Green River Community College, Central Washington University, and six school
              districts in the Green River area. This project is expanding those efforts to
              include in-service training for current and future teachers, creating a
              communications center for coordinating teacher training efforts, and increasing
              the recruitment of talented future teachers. Project Teach II is strengthening
              the existing pre-service teacher training and recruitment programs by
              implementing research-proven activities that integrate pre-service and
              in-service training. It also strengthens the interplay of education and
              industry by providing a forum for local businesses to participate in teacher
              training.
