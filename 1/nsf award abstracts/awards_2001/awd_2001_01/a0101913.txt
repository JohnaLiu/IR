Abstract    :
              This project will produce a series of textbooks to be used in professional
              development in mathematics for middle school teachers.  The subject areas for
              the textbooks are Algebra, Calculus, Geometry, Number Theory, and Probability
              and Statistics.  The books will emphasize content and pedagogy and will include
              ancillary materials such as videotapes of some of the professional development
              classes.  The texts will come from the Seminars for Elementary Specialists and
              Mathematics Educators (SESAME) in the Mathematics Department at the University
              of Chicago.  The writing team includes teachers, mathematics educators and
              research mathematicians.
