Abstract    :
              This research plan consists of two themes. The first is concerned
with
              investigations into the structure theory of injective-like objects in
the
              category of operator spaces, and involves the theory of
contractive
              projections on real or complex C*-algebras. The second is
a study of linear
              and nonlinear representations of the Lorentz group with
an eye towards finding
              physically meaningful  models in mathematical
physics. The link connecting
              these two objectives  is described in the
following paragraph.

Since the
              pioneering work of Jordan, von Neumann and Wigner  in the 1930s,
Segal in the
              1940s and 50s, and Alfsen-Shultz-Stormer in the 1970s, Jordan
algebras, and
              more recently Jordan triples, have  been used as a model for
the study of the
              state spaces of quantum mechanics. On the other hand,
contractive projections
              have played a key role in the structure theory of
Banach Jordan triple
              systems, and those which are completely contractive
give rise to injectives in
               the category of operator spaces (also known as
quantized Banach spaces). The
              PIs plan to study the fine structure of
contractive projections on operator
              spaces in order to gain a better
understanding of their role in operator space
              theory, as well as their
role, together with Jordan structures, in quantum
              mechanics and
relativity.
