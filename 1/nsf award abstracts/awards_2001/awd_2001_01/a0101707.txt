Abstract    :
              LaGuardia Community College is establishing the Institute for New Media and
              Applied Technologies in collaboration with new media industries, colleges, high
              schools, and community leaders. The goals are to bring IT education and skills
              training to the unique and underserved multi-ethnic residents and business
              population of Brooklyn and Queens. The project creates a comprehensive,
              interdisciplinary curriculum that emphasizes experimental learning and industry
              internships for students and faculty and leads to an A.A.S. degree in New
              Media. A total of 200 students will be enrolled and no less than 15 faculty
              members will be trained and participate in externships. The project will also
              establish skill standards, based on those developed by ACM and the Northwest
              Center for Emerging Technologies. The project will collaborate with the New
              York New Media Association, Consolidated Edison of New York, Queens County
              Overall Economic Development Corporation, and other area businesses and
              community organizations to form an advisory board and set benchmarks. The
              Northwest Center for Emerging Technologies also serves as the project
              evaluator.
