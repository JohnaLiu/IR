Abstract    :
              This EDC project seeks to build a model program for the development and support
              of middle grades mentor teachers and a replicable implementation strategy.  It
              will prepare 30 experienced teachers to serve as mentors for 60 novice
              teachers.  Project staff will work on content, pedagogy and mentoring skills
              with the 30 teachers in Massachusetts to improve their skills, knowledge and
              confidence so they can work effectively with 60 novice science teacers.  The
              goal of the project is to decrease attrition of novice teachers and develop
              their capacity to teach standards-based science.  Key project components
              include summer institutes on physical, life and eath science; on-site classroom
              observation and conferencing; monthly study groups and engagement of 45
              district administrators.
