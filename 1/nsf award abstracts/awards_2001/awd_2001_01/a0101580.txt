Abstract    :
              This three-year project is developing a curriculum on Distributed Energy
              Systems. The five industry-based course curriculums are becoming elective
              course options for community college degree and certificate programs, as well
              as being integrated into apprenticeship worker training. Accompanying the five
              industry-based course curriculums are supporting educational materials. Four,
              2-member teams composed of Brevard Community College (BCC) and Florida Solar
              Energy Center (FSEC) faculty are developing the curriculum and other
              educational materials. The public and professional community now have
              opportunities to learn about the economic, environmental, and workforce
              benefits of distributed energy through seminars and printed materials.
