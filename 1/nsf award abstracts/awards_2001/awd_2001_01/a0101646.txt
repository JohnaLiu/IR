Abstract    :
              
The institution is developing a watershed learning environment for their
              Integrated Natural Resources Technology program's innovative and successful
              curriculum. The Watershed Research and Assessment Project (WRAP) adds a
              contextual framework to the existing curriculum by integrating it physically
              into a small watershed so that students experience the interconnectedness and
              complexity of an ecosystem. This approach produces multi-disciplinary natural
              resource technicians with the knowledge, comprehension, and skills to support
              efforts for solving key environmental issues in the region. An important aspect
              of the program is the involvement of area high schools and local communities in
              the learning process. The project enables these groups to participate in
              collaborative watershed studies. The interdisciplinary faculty include those
              with extensive technician and technology education, as well as research and
              natural resources management experience. They are uniquely suited to develop
              and disseminate the Watershed Research and Assessment Project material and
              methods to high schools, community colleges and community groups.
