Abstract    :
              The 2nd International Symposium on Advances in Computational Heat Transfer will
              be held on May 20-25, 2001, in Palm Cove, Queensland, Australia. The
              International Centre for Heat and Mass Transfer will host the conference. The
              purpose of the conference is to provide technical exchange, identification of
              the state-of-the-art, and the projection of future needs and trends in
              computational techniques applied to heat transfer. The conference will assemble
              scientists and engineers working in fields related to, and requiring,
              computational methods for modeling all modes of heat transfer, including
              coupling with fluid flow. The symposium will be held at the Novotel Palm Cove
              Resort, Palm Cove, Queensland, Australia. The conference web site is
              (http://cht01.mech.unsw.edu.au); Begell House, Inc will publish the conference
              proceedings. The NSF funds will help support travel for U.S. participants
              consisting of undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and
              non-tenured faculty with limited research funding working in the field of
              computational heat transfer.
