Abstract    :
              Survey research has consistently demonstrated variation in the intimate lives
              and dyadic arrangements of heterosexual and homosexual men, including rates of
              partner change, expectations of emotional commitment, and acceptance of
              non-monogamous practices.  However, the pathways to these differences are less
              well understood.  Theories and studies often treat preferences of gay and
              straight men as fixed "traits" of individuals, when orientations develop and
              change over the life course.  Taking a social constructionist life course
              perspective, this project examines how structural contexts of opportunity and
              relational histories affect the development of intimate orientations and
              careers, and how orientations are constructed in response to these
              opportunities and constraints.  The project gathers life histories of 100
              heterosexual and homosexual (black and white) males between 21 and 49 years of
              age in New York City.  The life history method tracks continuities and turning
              points in intimate practices and dyadic arrangements from baseline orientations
              to the present.  It also explores racial differences in these processes. 
              Rather than make generalizations about gay and straight men, the project
              captures the dynamic interplay of structure and process, and thereby
              contributes to a more sociological understanding of behavior that is often
              viewed from individualistic or biological perspectives.
