Abstract    :
              This project is combining traditional surveying techniques with training in
              high-technology spatial data acquisition and manipulation in the Geomatics
              Technology Program. The program provides training in industry-standard
              applications including GIS, GPS, land information systems, remote sensing and
              traditional surveying. In this project, the scope and resources in the program
              are being expanded. The project's five major goals include improving teacher
              and faculty knowledge in geographic information technologies; developing a
              local mapping and surveying workforce; enhancing the technical experience for
              students; improving laboratories; and promoting careers in mapping, surveying,
              and geographic information technologies.

Activities include developing
              cooperative education and internships, providing more hand-on experiences for
              students with industry standard equipment, job shadowing for college faculty,
              summer workshops for high school teachers and college instructors, a fast-track
              program for industry professionals, and a short video to market Geomatics
              Technology to high school and non-traditional students.
