Abstract    :
              The goal of this project will be to analyze the effect of the mixing state of
              aerosols on global and regional direct forcing and temperatures. This effort
              involves the development of global-scale baseline aerosol model simulations and
              comparison with actual observations and climatologies. The project will
              investigate the global- and regional-scale mixing state of aerosol-particles
              and the resulting direct radiative forcing and feedbacks of aerosol-particles
              to climate. Aerosols to be investigated include (a) fossil-fuel soot and
              organic matter, (b) biomass burning gases and particles, (c) sulfur dioxide and
              resulting sulfate.
