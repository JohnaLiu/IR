Abstract    :
              A consortium of seven community colleges in Texas, lead by the College of the
              Mainland, along with their local high schools and industries are planning to
              address the development of a workforce with skills and knowledge in e-business.
              The necessary skills and competencies for jobs in e-business are assessed using
              the DACUM process and curricula are developed to provide a common technical
              core with four exit options - technical support, programming, graphic arts and
              security. The planning establishes a statewide industry/education partnership
              that possesses a broad grasp of the Internet economy. A partnership memorandum
              of understanding assures that each derives benefit. Presentations are made to
              strengthen public awareness and gain support.
