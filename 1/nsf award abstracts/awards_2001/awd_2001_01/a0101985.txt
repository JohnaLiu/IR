Abstract    :
              The National Teachers Enhancement Network for Elementary Teachers (NTEN) will
              electronically provide professional development to elementary teachers on
              science concepts based upon selected kit-based curricula from FOSS, STC, BSCS
              Science and Delta Education II.  The project will assist elementary teachers in
              deepening their science content knowledge and improve their ability to
              incorporate technology into their classes.

The development team will consist
              of MSU and other faculty with NTEN experience (from the Keystone project), K-6
              master teachers and instructional technologists.  Each module will be of 4-6
              weeks' duration. Initially, four modules will be pilot tested with 25 teachers.
               A second pilot for 50 teachers will occur in the second year of the project. 
              NTEN will specifically target teachers of Native American and other minority
              students.  The project will provide an Instructional Technology and Technical
              Support team to module instructors and participants.  This team will provide
              training in using technology to the instructors and develop an online
              professional development package for participants.  Furthermore, the Support
              team will provide an electronic listserve and chat room to establish a distance
              learning community for NTEN participants.  As further support, teachers will be
              encouraged to participate in school teams.
