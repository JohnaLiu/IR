The Executive Vice-President of Northwest Science and
              Technology University of Agriculture and Forestry, Professor Li Jing, has sent
              personal invitations to 11 U.S. scientists to help China assess soil erosion
              and environmental problems in the Yellow River watershed. Nine of the 11
              scientists are employees of the U.S. government.  The two non-government
              scientists require support for international travel and related
              expenses.

The proposed participation of two non-governmental U.S. scientists
              broadens the range of scientific disciplines represented on the team.  The trip
              would expose U.S. scientists working on the topic to programs under way and to
              field conditions in China and provide access to data that can be used to
              develop a scientific understanding of the process fundamentals in conditions
              more extreme than any found in the United States.  All housing and travel
              expenses inside China will be supported by the host country.  These funds would
              support international and incidental expenses for the two non-government
              members of the delegation.

A report of the issues, observations,
              conclusions, and recommendations will be submitted to both the host and the NSF
              sponsor.
