Abstract    :
              This project develops certificate and associate degree programs in computer
              integrated manufacturing. It provides a seamless educational pathway from high
              school through the two year associate degree on to a baccalaureate engineering
              degree and career placement. It involves a regional partnership focused on
              recruiting and training women and non-traditional students to meet the
              technology workforce needs of the region. It builds on and adapts a site-based
              learning approach employed in a prior ATE project implemented in the regional
              high schools. The major activities include establishing computer integrated
              manufacturing options in existing courses and curricula, integration of
              technical experiences across the curriculum, establishing a center and lab to
              simulate projects prior to the site-based learning experience, outreach and
              recruitment, summer orientation and internships and a host of other support
              services. A compendium of all instructional materials is to be made available
              to others interested in developing similar programs in computer integrated
              manufacturing.
