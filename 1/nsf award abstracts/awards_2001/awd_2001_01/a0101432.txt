Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the
              Chemistry Division and the Solid-State Chemistry Program in the Division of
              Materials Research support the ongoing work of Dr. George Whitesides in the
              Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University in
              Cambridge, Massachusetts.   The work will explore the self-assembly of
              components at the meso-scale (micrometers to centimeters in size), using
              strategies modeled on molecular self-assembly.   The work will be extended to
              smaller size, more complex topography (including 3D), and include electrical
              and optical functionality.   It will explore the value of molecular and
              biomolecular concepts and analogies for the design of meso-scale,
              self-assembling systems, including analogues of bubble raft assemblies
              developed for condensed matter physics.

This work at the meso-scale bridges
              the gap between devices with components at normal scale (cm) with those at the
              molecular level (nm), using concepts from chemistry and biology.   The work is
              expected to develop new methods to prepare tiny electronic and optical devices
              that are difficult or impossible to make by current methods.   Because of its
              interdisciplinary nature, it is expected to provide excellent training for the
              students involved.
