Abstract    :
              The Midwest Center for Information Technology is a consortium of ten community
              colleges together with four-year colleges, secondary school districts and
              businesses in Nebraska, Iowa, and North and South Dakota. The Center emphasizes
              the areas of networking, computer applications, systems integration,
              application development, telecommunications, and digital media. The goal is to
              increase the preparedness of the region's information technology (IT) workforce
              primarily through faculty and teacher professional development, 2+2+2
              articulation, innovative education/training programs targeting students at
              various levels including incumbent workers, and dissemination of best practices
              and proven deliverables. Objectives include increasing by 50% the number of
              teachers and faculty who hold industry-validated certifications; by 50% the
              number of students articulating to community college programs; by 50% the
              number of students completing community college IT programs; and by 25% the
              number of students articulating successfully to four-year colleges. These
              activities should lead to a 30% decrease in the number of unfilled IT positions
              in the region's businesses. The Center programs build upon other programs of
              the Applied Information Management Institute.
