Proposal No:  0101563 - Abstract

Some problems of
              mathematical and numerical analysis related to
singularly perturbed boundary
              value problems will be studied. The
mathematical problems include obtaining
              sharp bounds for derivatives of
the solution that take into account boundary
              layers, interior layers, and
corner singularities.  The numerical problems
              include the development of
stabilized discretizations for these singularly
              perturbed problems and
the study of the best approximation properties of
              singular perturbation
problems.

The proposed work studies physical systems
              in which some quantities
undergo rapid changes in certain regions. Such
              systems include fluid flow,
where the rapid changes occur at boundary layers,
              shocks, and interior
layers. These systems arise in the design of fluid
              machinery, the study
of underground oil and water transport, the modeling of
              airflow over
cars and airplanes, and other areas.  The results of this
              research will
be of use in the development of more accurate computer
              simulations of
these systems, with consequent improvements in the design of
              equipment
used in such real-world problems. In addition, the proposal
              provides
for regular visits of Professor M. Stynes to the U.S.; it is
              planned
that Prof. Stynes will interact with graduate students in mathematics
              who
are working in related areas.
