This award supports a two-year Science and Technology Agency
              (STA) Postdoctoral Fellowship for Michael Famiano of Ohio State University.  He
              will be undertaking his research with Professor Isao Tanihata at the Institute
              of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) in Saitama, Japan.  Dr. Famiano will
              be researching the measurement of beta-decay rates of r-process and other
              exotic neutron-rich nuclei.  The proposed work involves both experimental and
              theoretical efforts surrounding the rapid-neutron capture process, which is
              believed to be the source of heavy elements in stars and planets.  He will be
              carrying out sophisticated r-process calculations in which he will insert his
              predictions for excited state beta-decays into a state-of-the-art r-process
              code to observe the impact of the excited state decay half-lives on the
              r-process abundance predictions. 

The research will result in solving a
              longstanding problem in the formulation of r-process nucleosynthesis
              calculations.  The findings will then allow the incorporation of the calculated
              rates into more elaborate r-process models, and the experimental verification
              of these calculations.  Useful contributions to the field are likely, and the
              exposure of the awardee to a new research setting will be intellectually
              stimulating.  The proposed work will benefit through collaboration with the
              Japanese host laboratory, where Dr. Famiano will have access to the necessary
              experimental systems, equipment and expertise.
