Abstract    :
              Submitted under the guidelines for Teacher Retention and Renewal, this
              sixty-month project supports approximately 300 teachers of high school
              mathematics in fourteen school districts of California.  These teachers
              comprise three distinct groups.  First, those already experienced with
              instructional materials aligned with NCTM's Principles and Standards for School
              Mathematics "develop mentoring and professional development skills and serve as
              mentors and leaders in their districts...  The other two groups are veteran
              teachers wishing to improve their teaching through alternative means of
              instruction and assessment, and novice teachers needing mentoring and support
              in the critical early years."  The Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP)
              materials are the primary vehicle for the project's professional development. 
              The teacher enhancement curriculum includes summer and winter workshops and
              individual work, collaboration, mentoring and electronic networking throughout
              the school year.  All participants are expcected to make a commitment for at
              least two years (130 hours of professional development per year), but may
              choose to participate for three or four years.
