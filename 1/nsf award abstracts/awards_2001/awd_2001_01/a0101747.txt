Abstract    :
              This project provides for training and faculty professional development to
              students and faculty at a group of community colleges with large native
              American populations. It has goals that include increasing the numbers of
              American Indians in the technological workforce and enhancing the educational
              opportunities for students on the reservation. Students participate in a
              recently implemented information technology program at one of the community
              colleges. They have the opportunity to select courses to achieve different IT
              hardware certifications and to do internships in the community. The IT courses
              are offered by distance education, allowing place-bound reservation students
              the opportunity for a degree. Professional development opportunities for
              preservice teachers, teachers and college instructors in technological
              applications are also included, with integration of the technologies into the
              associated curricula. Summer workshops provide training for teachers who then
              serve as trainers and mentors for peers. This model of community collaboration
              and involvement addresses workforce needs in the geographic area and a unique
              way to increase the participation in IT careers by under-represented groups.
