Abstract    :
              This project involves a year of planning for the development of an ATE regional
              center for information technology. It includes forming regional partnerships
              including the key stakeholders having a vested interest in the economic and
              workforce development for information technology capacity. It also includes
              three symposia to raise awareness of the need for academic program reform and
              professional development for college faculty and K-12 teachers as well as to
              stimulate regionwide capacity building activities. Research activities identify
              IT gaps and establish benchmarks for IT development in the region. Finally, a
              facilities plan for the regional center is developed. All of these activities
              lay the foundation for the development of a project for a regional center for
              information technology in the next year.
