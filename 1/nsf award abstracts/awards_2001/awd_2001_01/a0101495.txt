Abstract    :
              
This project is instituting a Biotechnology Technician A.A.S. degree in
              response to state needs. More than 116 biotechnology firms are located in Utah
              with 57 moving in during the last eighteen months. These firms employ
              individuals focused on work in genetic engineering, bioinfomatics, molecular
              biology, and pharmaceutical development. Partners include the community
              college, local industries, universities in Utah, and 5 public school districts.
              Prior to this program, no two-year biotechnology programs were available in
              Utah or neighboring states. Industry representatives are involved in outlining
              skills competencies, delivering instruction and facilitating instructor
              professional development. Outcomes for this project include: (1) establishing
              reciprocal partnerships with local industry; (2) identifying, adapting and
              implementing secondary and college curriculum; (3) preparing college and
              secondary instructional staff; (4) supporting industry internships for faculty
              and students; (5) developing a state of the art instructional laboratory.
