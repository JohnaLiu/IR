Abstract    :
              The mission of the Applied Information Technology Education (AITE) project is
              (1) to equip and develop students who can function effectively in an
              information technology (IT) workplace, who can adapt to changes in emerging
              technologies, and who will become innovators in their respective disciplines,
              and (2) to prepare educators with the understanding of an IT economy and with
              the knowledge and skills to teach and develop the current and future workforce.
              This mission evolves from Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College's vision to
              develop a Gulf South workforce that can perform successfully in a knowledge-
              and idea-based economy, embedded with technology.

The project is
              accomplishing its mission by increasing the supply of IT workers--female IT
              workers, in particular--in the Gulf South region and developing programs in
              database administration and Web design and administration. Activities and
              methodologies to support the goals and objectives involve faculty training and
              certification; curriculum adaptation; developing a career awareness and
              exploration model, called "The IT Pathway," focusing on females and other
              underrepresented groups; communicating "The IT Pathway" to high school and
              college faculty and students; and disseminating the project's findings and
              products. The curricula developed in the project are geared to nationally
              recognized certifications and industry standards.
