Abstract    :
              
The Teacher Education Alliance for Math and Science (TEAMS), a partnership of
              7 school districts, Lee College, and the University of Houston/Clear Lake, is
              developing and strengthening lower division teacher education curricula in math
              and science; providing preservice students with opportunities for field
              experiences and interaction with inservice teachers; and recruiting prospective
              teachers, particularly from underrepresented groups. Outcomes of the project
              include a new team-taught interdisciplinary course, Physical Science/Algebra, a
              revised Math for Elementary Teachers course, and a new fully articulated
              associate degree program for prospective elementary teachers. New courses
              reflect the Texas state standards and new certification requirements for grades
              4-8. A series of Saturday Labs taught by community college and university
              faculty focuses on the understanding and development of math/science projects
              by pairs of preservice and inservice teachers. The preservice/inservice teams
              are designing experiments geared for 4th and 5th grade students and conducting
              the activities in the partner schools through a Traveling Lab. In addition,
              prospective teachers are providing classroom assistance to 4th and 5th grade
              mentor teachers in science and math.
