Abstract    :
              Extensive efforts have been made to properly incorporate remotely sensed
              atmospheric data from open oceans where conventional data are sparse into the
              numerical prediction models.  Along this line, the PI seeks to advance the
              assimilation of the Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) occultation data by
              improving old approaches as well as exploring a new method.  The degree of
              refraction of the radio signals transmitted by the GPS depends on the
              properties of the atmosphere through which the signals travel, and thus can be
              used to gain the knowledge of the atmospheric thermodynamic state.  This
              research project is divided into four areas: 1) Improve the computational
              efficiency of the raytracing approach (a forward modeling calculation to match
              the bending angle profile with the observed profile) used by the PI in her
              previous study and improve its performance in the lower troposphere; 2) Develop
              an efficient refractivity assimilation method by estimating the averaged
              atmospheric refractivity information along the ray path to obtain the
              integrated effect of refractivity index; 3) Assess and quantify errors in the
              GPS-derived refractivity data; 4) Evaluate and examine existing physical
              parameterization schemes using the information retrieved by the GPS data.  The
              potential impact of this study on weather predictions is significant
              considering the role that GPS data likely will play in the future.
