Abstract    :
              Field-aligned currents play an important role in magnetosphere-Ionosphere (M-I)
              coupling.  These currents can act as the source of free energy for a number of
              kinetic instabilities which lead to plasma energization.  The instabilities may
              also lead to the formation of plasma density cavities or enhancements, and
              these in turn play a role in the escape of heavy ions from the ionosphere.  All
              of these factors affect plasma transport properties in the M-I system, and the
              high latitude ionospheric plasma must also respond to both magnetospheric and
              corotational electric fields.  This study will examine the role of kinetic
              instabilities to M-I coupling and plasma transport processes.  A multi-scale
              model will be used to generate simulations which can be incorporated in other
              global models, such as those used in space weather research and forecasting.
