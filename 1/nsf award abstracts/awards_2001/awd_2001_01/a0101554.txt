Abstract    :
              
The Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS) is adapting and
              implementing the Career Transcript System (CTS) in 16 high school, college, and
              industry sites across the state. The primary goal is to create a state-wide
              system and national model focused on improving the technical education provided
              for Kentucky's current and future workforce in the Information Technology (IT),
              Engineering Technology (ET) and Manufacturing Technology (MT) sectors.
              Adaptation of this material will strengthen science, mathematics, engineering,
              and technical learning as well as improve the career skills of students and
              workers participating in the program. The CTS was created by the SCANS 2000
              Center at Johns Hopkins University with funding from NSF/ATE over the past
              eight years. It combines professional development, teaching tools, assessments,
              and verified documentation in the form of a Career Transcript (CT). Two
              campuses of KCTCS, Central Kentucky Technical College and Bowling Green
              Technical College, had previously pilot tested the CTS in IT and MT classrooms.
              This project is implementing the CTS at additional college sites, high schools,
              and industries across the state. By fostering partnerships with high schools
              and industry, KCTCS is creating a pipeline for future employees and enhancing
              skills development for current employees in the Kentucky IT, ET and MT sectors.
              Over the course of two years, 835 students and workers are receiving Career
              Transcripts, 32 KCTCS faculty and staff are being trained to use the CTS, 12
              faculty are being certified to train other faculty, KCTCS is hosting a two-day
              state wide conference to disseminate results, and a CTS committee is working to
              institutionalize the system across the state.
