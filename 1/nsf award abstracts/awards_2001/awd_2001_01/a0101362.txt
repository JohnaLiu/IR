Abstract    :
              The Community College of Philadelphia is engaged in a partnership with 12
              baccalaureate-degree granting institutions in Pennsylvania to: (1) create a new
              degree option for students preparing for careers in secondary math or science
              education; and (2) expand the articulation agreements with four-year
              institutions to include secondary education. Two new courses and educational
              materials focused on inquiry-based, hands-on learning, are being developed for
              prospective teachers: Teaching with Technology and Problem-Solving in Math and
              Science. Both courses explore the use of technology to investigate authentic
              problems in math and science. Students develop a portfolio of problem-based
              learning scenarios using technology appropriate for use in their future
              professional practice. The project addresses the International Society for
              Technology in Education standards for preservice preparation in technology. The
              project also includes customized systems of advising and mentoring; recruitment
              of prospective teachers from mathematics and science courses; learning
              communities; an education student club; and faculty development workshops.
