Abstract    :
              This project is creating a partnership between Sisseton-Wahpeton Community
              College (SWCC) and Northern State University (NSU) that allows Native American
              and other area students to receive their bachelor's degrees in elementary and
              middle school education without having to leave the area. The students receive
              a paraprofessional degree from SWCC and then work in the classrooms while
              completing their bachelor's degree. They complete the program for their
              bachelor's degree while on the reservation. 

The project is based on a
              seven-point plan:
1) Development of an articulation agreement with Northern
              State University whereby NSU delivers most of the third and fourth year level
              educational classes on the reservation.
2) Creation of a degree that trains
              papaprofessionals who have expertise in the use of technology as a teaching
              aid.
3) Training of in-service instructors.
4) Offering support for students
              in the form of mentoring and securing finances.
5) Raising students'
              mathematics proficiency.
6) Recruitment of students to create a
              self-sustaining program.
7) Creation of a listserv that gives all tribal
              colleges easy access to each other.
