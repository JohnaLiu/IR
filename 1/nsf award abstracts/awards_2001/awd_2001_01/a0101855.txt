              profession.  Designated as the Teachers As Mentor program (TAM) for South Texas
              rural and small school districts, sixty mentors will be prepared and each will
              mentor three novice science, mathematics and technology teachers for a minimum
              137 hours each.  The phased mentoring plan has each mentor teacher mentoring
              one novice teacher the first year, two the second year and three the third
              year.  Mentors are supported by project personnel and their local districts for
              travel to national meetings to participate in the larger professional learning
              community of mentor teachers.  The novice teachers receive the mentoring
              support plus educational materials and local district support.
