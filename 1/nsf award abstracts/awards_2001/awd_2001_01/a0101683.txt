Abstract    :
              This project is building on prior efforts of the American Mathematical
              Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC) in the area of teacher preparation
              to:
 (a) elevate awareness among two-year college mathematics faculty of the
              role two-year colleges play in teacher preparation;
 (b) identify and promote
              model programs that use appropriate technology as a foundation piece of the
              teacher preparation coursework in the first two years of college;
 (c) broaden
              the information base by collecting data on the nature of mathematics coursework
              and the appropriate use of technology at two-year colleges for preservice
              teacher;
 (d) strengthen collaborative bonds between two- and four-year
              colleges and feature successful collaborations;
 (e) equip two-year college
              mathematics faculty to strengthen teacher preparation initiatives at their
              colleges; and 
 (f) disseminate information about effective two-year college
              strategies in the areas of early field experiences for preservice teachers, the
              appropriate use of technology, mathematics content for preservice teachers, and
              recruitment of prospective teachers, particularly minorities and
              underrepresented groups.

In particular, the three-year program is holding
              four regional conferences that highlight the role of two-year colleges in
              teacher preparation. These conferences where best practices are being
              disseminated are being attended by teams who prepare action plans for improving
              preservice education at their own institutions. Two intensive summer institutes
              are being offered to address issues of content, technology, and pedagogy for
              prospective teachers. Capstones for the project are the creation of Traveling
              Workshops in Teacher Preparation and an extensive website of resource
              materials.
