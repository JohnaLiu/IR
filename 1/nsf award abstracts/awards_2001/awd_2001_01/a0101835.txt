Abstract    :
              The first Conference on Social Cognitive Neuroscience will be held on the UCLA
              campus in April 2001. This conference will highlight the new but fast growing
              field of Social Cognitive Neuroscience. Symposia will focus on Social Relations
              and Theory of Mind, Emotion, Control and Automaticity, Attitudes and Attitude
              Change, and Stereotyping and Social Perception. Each symposium will consist of
              research reports using neuroimaging, neuropsychological, or computational
              modeling methodologies. Additional panel discussions will allow cognitive
              neuroscientists and social scientists to discuss ways in which important
              questions from the social sciences can be tested using the methods of cognitive
              neuroscience. There will also infrastructure talks focusing on developing
              coherent training programs in social cognitive neuroscience and securing
              funding for this sort of interdisciplinary research. There will also be a
              poster session to allow for rapid transmission of other research findings.
              Informal sessions will allow additional opportunities for researchers to become
              acquainted and to share their latest research results. The conference will help
              to inform the new emphasis at NSF on cognitive neuroscience (NSF 01-041).
