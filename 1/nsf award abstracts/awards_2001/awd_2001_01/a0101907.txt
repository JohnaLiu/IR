Abstract    :
              Submitted under the NSF 00-99 guidelines for Teacher Enhancement: Mathematics
              and Science Courses for Improving Teacher Qualifications, the primary purpose
              is to develop six courses for middle-school mathematics teachers during this
              thirty-nine month project.  The targeted geographic area is the Delmarva region
              in the states of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia.  There are forty-five middle
              schools in the area and over 500 middle-school teachers.  Six professors will
              each develop a course for middle school teachers.  There are three objectives
              for the project: 1) to develop six credit-bearing, interconnected graduate
              courses in mathematics for middle-school teachers to foster a deep
              understanding of fundamental mathematics; 2) to implement the mathematics in
              the teachers' schools, reflect on their experiences and modify their teaching;
              3) to reduce the anxieties which teachers experience due to their insufficient
              mathematical backgrounds, and thus improve their confidence.  The courses will
              be delivered in an incremental manner.
