Abstract    :
              This project is developing two new AAS degree programs in Manufacturing
              Engineering Technology and Plastics and Polymers Manufacturing. These programs
              are based on the development of new course materials and on the adaptation of
              curricula and courses from Sinclair Community College and the Pennsylvania
              College of Technology. The programs serve current manufacturing employees,
              employees who are newly entering the workforce or seeking a career change, and
              graduating high school students aspiring to develop essential technical career
              skills. Course content addresses critical workforce skills that have been
              identified by regional manufacturers. Articulation partnerships are established
              with Old Dominion University and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
              University. These partners offer third- and fourth-year-level manufacturing
              technology courses for program graduates.
