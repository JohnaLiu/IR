Abstract    :
              The purpose of the proposed grant is to design and lay the necessary groundwork
              for major education research projects related to K-12 science and mathematics
              in the Delta resgion of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas.  This project
              provides the advantage of working within the framework of an established major
              systemic reform initiative, The Delta Rural Systemic Inititiative.  We will
              bring together an interdisciplinary cadre of national and regional researchers,
              resouce personnel and practitioners, all working in close collaborat8ion, to
              develop partnerships and research designs which will lead to major research
              initiatives focused on the underpinnings of systemic changes in regions serving
              impoverished, rural populations.
