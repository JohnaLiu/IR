Abstract    :
              The proposal for supporting the construction of a RICH (Ring Imaging Cherenkov)
              detector for the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer as a cosmic ray detector on the
              Space Station.  The proposed work include: construction and test of the RICH
              detector, participation in the Data Acquisition System of the RICH detector,
              computer simulation of the RICH detector for optimization and analysis.
