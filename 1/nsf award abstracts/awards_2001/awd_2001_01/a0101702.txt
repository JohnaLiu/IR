Abstract    :
              The incompressibility of the ionosphere has led to the paradox that it appears
              as if the ionosphere must sometimes drive the magnetosphere.  To understand
              this problem the mechanism by which information is transferred from one part of
              the ionosphere to another must be examined.  This project will investigate the
              role of the fast-mode plasma wave and how it propagates in the ionospheric
              waveguide.  The investigation will look at how far fast-mode waves can travel
              and how they couple to shear-mode Alfeven waves.  Strongly coupled waves would
              imply that the propagation is controlled by the lower altitude ionosphere's
              properties.  This will provide a definitive answer to whether or not the
              magnetosphere can be driven by the ionosphere.
