This project concerns several questions about integral 
              representations for holomorphic functions of one and several complex 
              variables, related (singular) integral boundary operators, and elliptic 
              boundary value problems. The main underlying theme consists of estimates of 
              Cauchy singular integral operators with focus on the case of domains with rough
              boundaries. 


The crux of this project is the basic observation that it is
              often possible   to determine the values a certain function, say, f, takes
              inside, say, a ball, by only  measuring the values f takes on the surface of
              the ball, via the  computation of a (surface) integral involving the datum f
              and an auxiliary
function K ( the "kernel").  It may help to think of the
              value f at a point
P as the temperature at this point: by (easily) measuring
              temperature on the  
surface of a ball (think of the ball as been made of a
              solid material, such as 
metal), one can then find out the value of the
              temperature  inside the ball without having to reach the inside, simply by
              plotting  the surface temperature data in an integral formula, and then
              computing the  integral. Because of the microscopic nature of matter, it is
              much more natural  to make these measurements and calculations on a "rough"
              body, say a cube  (which has corners and edges), than a "smooth" ball. In the
              mathematical  model, this new situation translates into additional constraints
              on the  kernel K which make it much harder to effectively use K in the
              computation  of the integrals.  In this project we study certain
              ("complex")analogues of these mathematical models in the context of "rough"
              domains.
