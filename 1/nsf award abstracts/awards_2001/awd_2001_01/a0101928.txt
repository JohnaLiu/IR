Abstract    :
              This four-year Teacher Enhancement Renewal and Retention project will prepare
              180 experienced teachers to be mentors for 360 novice science, mathematics and
              technology teachers.  Over a span of three years each novice teacher will
              receive a minimum of 150 hours mentoring.  The phased mentoring plan has each
              mentor teacher mentoring one novice teacher the first year, two the second year
              and three the third year.  Mentors are supported by project personnel, their
              local districts and for travel to professional meetings to participate in the
              larger professional learning community of mentor teachers.  The novice teachers
              receive the mentoring support plus educational materials and local district
              support.  The project emphasizes a rigorous content-focused professional
              development (PD) curriculum, dictated in part by hiring practices that employ
              teachers who have not fully met state licensing standards.  PD opportunities
              will be delivered through summer institutes and statewide conferences.  Of the
              teachers who are supported directly by the project, 180 will serve as district
              and statewide content mentors for the states of Maine, New Hampshire and
              Vermont.
