Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to expand our understanding of the effects of
              various magnetic cloud configuration on the magnetosphere - ionosphere system
              by analyzing simulations for a set of idealized magnetic clouds occur in
              variety of different configurations.  The polarity of the magnetic field
              orientation appears to be ordered by solar cycle and may have a determining
              role on the geoeffectiveness of a given magnetic cloud.  Furthermore, magnetic
              clouds are often accompanied by interplanetary shocks, high-speed streams and
              trailing density enhancements.  The development of an understanding of
              fundamental physics involved in these interactions has been hampered by an
              inability to separate these potentially synergistic features.  The
              Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) global MHD code will be used to simulate the
              magnetosphere - ionosphere system under a variety of magnetic cloud conditions.
               In addition, a 2-D relativistic guiding center particle code will be used to
              mode the evolution of the radiation belts.  

The study will focus on 1)
              varying the polarity of the magnetic cloud, 2) changing the duration of the IMF
              rotation interval, 3) changing the energy input into the magnetosphere, and 4)
              including trailing density enhancements.  A baseline set of parameters derived
              from the simulation will be used to assess which features control the
              geoeffectiveness of a given configuration.
