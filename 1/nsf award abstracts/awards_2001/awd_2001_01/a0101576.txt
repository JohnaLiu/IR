Abstract    :
              This project is conducting planning activities for the development of a model
              curriculum based on an existing program at Evergreen Valley College. The
              envisioned curriculum will integrate new technologies such as GIS, GPS, CADD
              and computer-aided math into civil engineering technology. Design constraints
              envisioned include an expandable certificate program that includes all course
              descriptions, textbooks, assignments, lab activities, and fieldwork.
