This Industry/University Collaborative project, a component of
              the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) initiative,
              involves faculty and students at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) and
              Texas A&M University (TAMU) teamed with practicing engineers at General
              Electric Medical Systems (GEMS) as participants in a new research/educational
              program combining Ph.D. research in RF technology with industrial experience in
              state-of-the-art Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems. The activity is to
              support development of innovative, collaborative industry-university research
              and educational programs. Support will be provided for eight Ph.D. students
              (four at UIC [this project] and four at TAMU [award 0101059]), who will be
              co-advised by university faculty and industrial scientist/engineers. These
              students will spend one semester or summer each year doing research at GEMS. 
              

While in residence at GEMS in the Applied Sciences Laboratory, the students
              will have access to advanced MRI system design and testing equipment and work
              under the supervision of the industrial Co-Principal investigators, who also
              will serve as members of the student's Ph.D. advisory committees. Additionally,
              six senior GEMS engineers/scientists will participate in this project as
              mentors for the students. 

This project is expected to establish a new model
              for industry/university collaborative research and education programs at the
              Ph.D. level in MRI engineering.
