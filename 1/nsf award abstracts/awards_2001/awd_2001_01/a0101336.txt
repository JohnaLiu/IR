The 2001 joint meeting of the International Conference on
              Plasma Science (ICOPS) and Pulsed Power Conference (PPC), which is being called
              Pulsed Power Plasma Science 2001 (PPPS-2001), will be the first of its kind. 
              Historically, the two conferences, which have considerable technical overlap,
              have both been held in June.  In recent years travel restrictions have
              increasingly forced individuals whose technical areas are covered by both
              conferences to choose between them.  PPPS-2001, therefore, is an experiment by
              the IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society, the parent organization for both
              conferences, to determine the viability of holding these conferences jointly on
              a regular basis.  PPPS-2001 is scheduled for June 18-22, 2001 at Rio Suite
              Hotel in Las Vegas, NV.

This project requests travel support to defray the
              travel expenses for young investigators whose papers have been selected for
              presentation at the Conference, but who lack funds and might not be able to
              attend without travel support.  It is proposed that the PPPS-2001 Student
              Grants Committee, in collaboration with the Technical Program Committee, select
              those to receive the support.  The total amount requested is $6,000 on the
              basis of an average travel grant of $500 for 12 participants.
