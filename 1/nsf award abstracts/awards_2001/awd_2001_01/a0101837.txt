The proposed NSF Workshop, scheduled forDec. 4-5, 2000, will
              examine critical and enabling optical technologies that will be required to
              meet the needs of the coming bandwidth revolution.  The location for the
              workshop will be the Marriott Key Bridge in Rosslyn, VA.  This proposal
              contains the fruits of a planning meeting by the Steering Committee held on
              August 8" at the NSF.  Specifically, this proposal addresses: (i) a description
              and rationale for the workshop, (ii) a list of topics and potential speakers to
              be considered, (iii) an agenda, and (iv) a budget.

The NSF Workshop will
              explore research opportunities in critical enabling technologies, with the goal
              of assuring continued bandwidth and capacity growth in optical communications
              and networking systems throughout the next decade.  The workshop will address
              forward-looking, high-impact research, including technologies for all-optical
              packet switched networking, novel technologies for increasing the optical fiber
              communications bandwidth beyond 50 THz, and microwave photonics for LANs and
              very high frequency wireless systems.  Potential bottlenecks will be identified
              and means of overcoming them will be explored with a view towards achieving
              50-100 Tb/s networks.  Moreover, the workshop will also explore how the NSF can
              play a strategic role in alleviating the critical shortage of trained optical
              engineers for the workforce.

The workshop will bring together experts from
              academia, industry, and government to discuss these areas and identify critical
              issues in materials, device, systems, and networking research.  The final
              report prepared by the workshop participants will detail important challenges,
              both fundamental and technological, that are likely to be at the forefront of
              this field for many years to come.

The workshop is being organized by
              several NSF directorates, including: ENG, MPS/DNM, and CISE/ANIR.
