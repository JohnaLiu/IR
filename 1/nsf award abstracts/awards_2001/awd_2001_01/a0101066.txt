This award provides partial support for
              participants to attend  
a Workshop on Mathematical Aspects of Orbifold String
              Theory  
to be held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 
May 4 through
              May 7, 2001.  The workshop will bring together  
groups of mathematicians and
              physicists to identify and outline 
emerging problems associated with diverse
              mathematical developments 
arising in orbifold string theory. In particular
              this event will  foster interdisciplinary research involving mathematical
              physics, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, algebraic topology and
              representation theory. Recent Ph.D.'s and graduate students are especially
              encouraged to attend and apply for support.  Further information, including
              invited speakers, schedule of talks, housing information and a registration
              form is available at
