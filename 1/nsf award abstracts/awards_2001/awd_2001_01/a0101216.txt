Abstract    :
              This project focuses on a study of strong optical superradiance that utilizes
              cold ytterbium atoms contained within a magneto-optical trap and a
              short-memory-time optical cavity.   Strong superradiance comprises the regime
              of radiative decay where correlations within a material sample lead to
              radiative energy damping on time scales substantially different from the
              natural lifetime of the constituent quantum systems.  The use of the
              short-memory-time cavity accelerates the time scale on which superradiance
              occurs within a specific atomic sample while leaving the system dynamics
              otherwise unchanged.   As a result, strong superradiance can be observed in
              optically thin atomic samples and therefore in the absence of intra-sample
              field propagation effects.  The use of cavity acceleration and essentially
              non-dephasing atomic ytterbium provides the first experimental opportunity to
              demonstrate and investigate strong superradiance under conditions similar to
              those assumed in original descriptions.
