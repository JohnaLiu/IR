Abstract    :
              The Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS) is adapting and
              implementing curricular materials and best practices from South Carolina's ATE
              Center of Excellence in order to increase enrollment, retention, diversity, and
              success rate of technology students. The goals of this project are: to develop
              a technology "portal" (i.e., a pre-technology curriculum) to serve
              under-prepared students desiring to enter a number of technology-related
              programs (not only Engineering Technology but Industrial and Engineering
              Technology, Applied Process Technologies, Industrial Chemical Technology,
              Information Technology and other related Technology Programs); to adapt the SC
              ATE Engineering Technology Freshman Year Core to accommodate the needs of
              KCTCS' Industrial & Engineering Technology program; to develop the faculty
              expertise to design and implement an integrated curriculum at both the portal
              and freshman levels; and to design and implement an integrated curriculum that
              will enhance students' basic skills in mathematics, communications, English,
              and physics, utilizing applied methodology in a technology environment. Key
              business and industry partners across the state are collaborating with faculty
              in curriculum design, and business and industry advisory committees at each
              pilot college are reviewing proposed curricula. All curricula are encompassing
              the skills identified in the SCANS report. The Kentucky model is adapting
              modules developed by the SC ATE and is using South Carolina's practices to
              create additional modules to meet the needs of the Commonwealth. As a result of
              this project, it is envisioned that a more diverse population will enroll in
              technology courses, remediation time will be shortened, students will be better
              prepared to enter the workforce and/or baccalaureate programs, and participants
              (faculty and students) will connect the required general education components
              more directly to the technological field in which they are teaching and
              learning.
