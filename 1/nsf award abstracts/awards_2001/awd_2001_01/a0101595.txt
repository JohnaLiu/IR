This award to University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of
              Marine and Atmospheric Sciences provides instrumentation to improve the
              shared-use scientific instrumentation available to researchers using the four
              research ships operated by University of Miami and the Harbor Branch
              Oceanographic Institution.  These four vessels, R/Vs Seward Johnson, Seward
              Johnson II, Edwin Link and Walton Smith, are all operated as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  The
              specific instrumentation supported by this award includes a variety of
              environmental sensors, replacement shipboard computers and related tape and
              disk storage, and water sampling bottles.  These improvements will be of
              substantial advantage to marine scientists using the ships in their research
              during 2001 and future years.
