Abstract    :
              This project supports the development of seven new manufacturing degree programs
              in the Pittsburgh area through a coalition known as PRIME - Partnership for
              Regional Innovation in Manufacturing Education. These manufacuring programs
              address twelve core competencies as identified by the Society of Manufacturing
              Engineers. The coalition includes two-year and four-year institutions and
              approximately fifty industrial partners. The project consists of the adaptation
              of exemplary material from other manufacturing programs and the development of
              twenty modules in engineering materials, manufacturing processes, quality and
              metrology, computer applications in manufacturing, and programmable logic
              controllers. An active, collaborative learning approach of exploration, dialog,
              and application is being incorporated in the modules. Industry-supplied
              projects for collaborative student teams are being developed, and
              newly-equipped laboratory instrumentation is networked for cross-institutional
              use. Web-based conferencing facilitates regional collaborative teaming
              opportunities.
