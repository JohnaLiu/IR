Special
              Projects:  Graduate Students in Computing Travel Support for Career Workshops

              
This award to the Computing Research Association (CRA) provides funds to
              support advanced graduate students to attend the CRA career workshops in 2001,
              2002, and 2003.  The workshops are held in Washington, DC and are open to all
              recent doctorates and advanced graduate students in computing disciplines. 
              Topics incorporated in the workshops include development of effective teaching
              practices, research programs, and developing a successful academic career
              overall.  Senior computer scientists and engineers conduct the workshops and
              program managers from NSF and DARPA discussing how their research funding
              programs are organized are also part of the workshops.
