Abstract    :
              An oriented matroid is a combinatorial abstraction which can be used to
              encapsulate features of a nite point set in Euclidean space which are of
              interest in combinatorial geometry.  It is planned to study certain enumeration
              problems involving oriented matroids by making use of the theory of valuations
              on distributive lattices.  Indeed some progress along these lines has already
              been made.  It is hoped that information on the range of certain important
              functions for example, the f-vectors of convex polytopes, or the number of
              "k-sets" of a finite point set will be generated. Additionally it is hoped that
              this research will enable the extension to oriented matroids in general of
              substantial results already obtained for uniform oriented
              matroids.

Combinatorial geometry is a subject with a venerable history which
              in recent years has become an even more important arena for research, due to
              its applications in the area of algorithms for geometrical structures. 
              Research in combinatorial geometry often leads to better algorithms in
              computational geometry, which in turn leads, for example, to improved design of
              computer chips, better algorithms for image analysis and processing, and so
              forth.
