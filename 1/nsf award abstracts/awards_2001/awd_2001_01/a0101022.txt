Theoretical interest and experimental efforts concerning
              Lagrangian 
particle analysis have been increasing in the last years. The
              proposed 
research is to develop an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach initiated
              very 
recently. A main object of study in this approach is a diffusive
              Lagrangian 
path inverse that allows a natural formulation, including a
              viscous 
analogue of the inviscid Cauchy formula. The solution is built using
              a 
product expansion near the identity transformation. It is proposed to study
              
this construction and apply it to randomly forced flows. In addition, the
              
study of quenching of flames by strong random flows in turbulent 
combustion
              is proposed.

Fluids and plasmas exhibit many active scales of motion, and
              are 
notoriously difficult to compute and predict accurately. The reason is
              that 
the equations describing them are not well understood. It is proposed to
              
study mathematically the processes of transport of momentum and heat 
under
              extreme conditions
