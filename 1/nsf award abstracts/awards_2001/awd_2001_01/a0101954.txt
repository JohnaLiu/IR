Abstract    :
              This proposal envisions a model partner-based system that provides lead teachers
              both school-based workshops and a summer institute for science content.  The
              model has three components:  a science pedagogy part provided by science
              education faculty, a science content component provided by active research
              scientists and a classroom teaching component.

The specific goals are to
              deepen teachers understanding of content, scientific inquiry and pedagogy,
              including curriculum and assessment strategies; to develop a group of sixty
              teacher leaders and to provide teachers access to effective applications of
              educational technology.
