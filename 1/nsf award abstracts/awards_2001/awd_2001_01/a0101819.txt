Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to advance the state of multi-agent processing for
              intelligent, adaptive biomedical monitoring systems. Adaptive reasoning will
              align with an agent's mission and guide agent monitoring of aspects of a target
              environment--comprised of base models with interjected instrumentation
              readings. Base models are infused with "live" interactive data and decision
              functionality embedded within multiple, autonomous agents, which determine
              actions, set off alerts and export state. Experimentation will involve
              exploring the most effective guidance capabilities from genetically programmed
              agents and adaptive neural networks, in combination with a supportive knowledge
              base. While the approach has broad application possibilities, it has specific
              implications for supplemental assistance to medical personnel inundated with
              information. This project will also provide opportunities for undergraduate
              students to become actively involved in a growing area of computer science
              research.
