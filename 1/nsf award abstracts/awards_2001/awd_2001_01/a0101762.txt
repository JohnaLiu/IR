This award will provide
              partial support for the second National Innovation Summit to be held at the
              University of California, San Diego, on April 5-6, 2001. The Summit will serve
              as a forum for over 150 public and private sector leaders to discuss issues
              pertinent to the nation's economic competitiveness and technological
              innovation.  The core components of the agenda, which highlight NSF's research
              and education goals, include winning the skills race, sustaining American
              leadership at the frontiers of discovery and research, and strengthening
              regional innovation capabilities. In each of these areas, leaders will define
              strategic challenges, illuminate them with policy research, and develop broadly
              supported policy recommendations advancing the national interest. Consequently
              the Summit will raise awareness of the close connection between innovation and
              competitiveness in the global economy.
