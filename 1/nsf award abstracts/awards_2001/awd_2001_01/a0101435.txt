Abstract    :
              With this new RUI award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the work of Dr. Donald W. Slocum and Dr. Robert W. Holman in the
              Department of Chemistry at Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green,
              Kentucky.   The work involves detailed studies of directed ortho-metalation
              reactions involving organolithium reagents in various hydrocarbon solvents with
              added Lewis base ethers  like THF and bis-chelating amines like TMEDA.   The
              reactions involve alkylation of aromatic substrates like anisole,
              dimethylanaline, and dimethylbenzylamine, where coordination of the heteroatom
              is believed to facilitate addition of the alkyl group at the ortho position.  
              NMR studies will be carried out using 13C and 7Li isotopes.

This award will
              support a growing effort in chemical research at Western Kentucky  University,
              and involve undergraduates in original research of interest to chemists in both
              academia and industry seeking improved methods for the synthesis of useful
              organic compounds.   The PI has active collaborations with area industries, and
              one of them is providing financial support.   Many of the students are expected
              to find work in local industries or go on to advanced degrees.
