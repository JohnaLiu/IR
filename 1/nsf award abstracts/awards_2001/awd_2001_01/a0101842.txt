Abstract    :
              Since 1998, The Evaluation Center at Western Michigan University has been
              conducting a project for Materials Development, Training and Support Services
              (MTS) through the support of the Division of Research, Evaluation and
              Communication.  This award has permitted intensive evaluation training of
              faculty and advanced graduate students through summer institutes.  In addition,
              a number of other training activities as well as support mechanisms for
              evaluators have been developed, such as training materials, an Evaluators'
              Directory, and checklists for evaluators.

Under this award, the work of the
              Evaluation Center on MTS will continue.  Forty-five participants will be
              trained during the summer, and 18 of these will continue on into internships
              during the following academic year.  Additionally, a model for training
              evaluators will be developed and tested, including an instrument for testing
              knowledge and a self-assessment measure.  There will also be training materials
              developed by participants that will be made available to the field.  Finally,
              the web-site developed for evaluators will be enhanced and used more
              widely.
