Abstract    :
              This award is providing a series of hands-on professional and curriculum
              development workshops and follow-up activities for HS and TYC physics teachers
              who serve students involved in technology-based or technician careers. The
              workshops are focussed toward the effective integration and implementation of
              technology and the use of active learning strategies in areas such as
              microcomputer-based laboratories, digital video, computer simulations,
              conceptual tasks and tools, web and Internet activities, group work, assessment
              of learning, and physics-related technician education. Activities are linking
              participants to previous ATE projects and industry.

Outcomes of the
              workshops include:
- an enhanced understanding and appreciation of the needs
              of the technician workforce;
- educational programs that deal with technician,
              workforce issues;
- the opportunity to identify and evaluate the
              appropriateness of the workshop ideas toward meeting the needs of these
              students and technician programs;
- knowledge of and experience with recent
              advances and applications of computer technology, ATE supported centers and
              projects, assessment in student learning, and relevant curriculum materials and
              activities;
- the background and incentive to develop, adapt, adopt, and
              implement workshop activities and materials into additional courses and
              programs; and
- a method to build bridges and to develop working relationships
              between TYC and HS physics and technology programs, and local or regional
              businesses and industries.
