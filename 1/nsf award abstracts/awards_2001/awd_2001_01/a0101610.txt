James T. Staley of the University of Washington
              has been awarded a grant to to support 8 U.S. PIs and 8 students/postdocs to
              attend a 2-day public symposium and 1-day workshop entitled "Genomics: Beyond
              the Sequence" in Edinburgh, Scotland, 26-27 March, 2001.  The event is
              sponsored by the Systematic and Evolutionary Group of the Society of General
              Microbiology and the International Committee for Systematic Bacteriology. 
              Participants at the symposium and workshop will discuss, digest and forecast
              the impact that genomics will have on our understanding of the evolution of
              prokaryotes and their inter-relationships.  It is intended that speakers will
              draw heavily from data, tools, etc. derived from complete genome sequencing
              projects and develop a perspective of future developments at the interface of
              microbial systematics and genomics. Prokaryotic microbes are the oldest, most
              abundant and most diverse forms of life on earth.  They are responsible for
              maintaining Earth's biogeochemical cycles, sustaining its ecosystems, and
              regenerating the air that we breathe, the water that we drink, and the soil in
              which we grow our food.  Microorganisms are also at the foundation of the
              modern revolution in biotechnology.  An understanding of the evolutionary
              patterns and processes of these organisms is essential to all microbiological
              research, and genomics offers the ultimate tool for resolving their phylogeny,
              taxonomy and classification.  Half of the funds of this award will go to
              supporting training for students and postdoctoral participants in the symposium
              and workshop.
