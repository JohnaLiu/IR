Abstract    :
              This four-year program prepares 128 high school chemistry teachers with the
              content knowledge, instructional and leadership skills and confidence to serve
              as peer mentors/collegial coaches, workshop presenters and agents of change in
              their schools.

These lead teachers will be provided with in-depth chemical
              knowledge, as well as skills to implement standards-based instruction and
              assessment. The skills and knowledge to serve as mentor, coaches, presenters
              and change agents for novice teachers will also be enhanced.

The program is
              composed of a 3-week summer institute each of 2 summers with extensive academic
              year follow up through electronic networking, on-line mentoring, workshops,
              newsletters and classroom visits.
