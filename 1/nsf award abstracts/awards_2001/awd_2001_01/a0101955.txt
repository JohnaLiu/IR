Abstract    :
              The mission of "High Expectations for Learning Middle School Science
              (HELMSS)"
Pilot Local Systemic Change (LSC) is to nurture middle level
              scientific literacy throughout Rhode Island.  The project is managed by a
              partnership of Rhode Island College, East Bay Educational Collaborative and ten
              partnering districts.  The $658,000 project is funded by $200,000 from the
              National Science Foundation and $458,000 from Rhode Island College and the ten
              partnering districts.

Goals include building a foundation for middle level
              science systemic change, developing cooperative relationships, building the
              capacity to implement standards-based curricula to deliver effective
              professional development and to provide materials support for all middle
              schools in Rhode Island.

HELMSS is conceptualized as a three-phase, six-year
              project.  Phase 1, "Initiating," began in 2000.  Project personnel assessed
              teacher and system needs, designed courses, examined science frameworks and
              existing curricula and supported the piloting of middle school science
              instructional materials such as FOSS for Middle School and NSRC's Science and
              Technology Concepts for Middle Schools.

Phase 2, "Building Capacity,"
              (2001-2003) is the HELMSS Pilot LSC.  The primary work of this phase is to
              build awareness of middle school science reform, forge new partnerships among
              other districts in the region, and develop middle school science teachers'
              capacity to lead their peers.

Eighteen teachers will participate in three
              45-hour science content courses and a seminar focusing on leadership, pedagogy,
              and curriculum.  A principal seminar will enable them to work effectively with
              teachers on-site to support standards-based teaching and learning.  By working
              closely with K-12 teachers and administrators, higher education faculty will
              improve middle level teacher preparation programs.

Phase 3, "Scaling Up,"
              (2003-2006) is the HELMSS Comprehensive LSC.  More than 100 Rhode Island middle
              level teachers will improve student performance in middle level science.  All
              teachers will implement NSF-funded instructional materials and engage in
              professional development opportunities created during Phase 2, "Building
              Capacity".
