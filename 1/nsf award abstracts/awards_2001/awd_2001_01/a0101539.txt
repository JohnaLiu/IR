The
              Ahlfors-Bers Colloquium is to be held in October 2001 at the
University of
              Connecticut campus at Storrs.  This award primarily
supports the participation
              of graduate students, junior
researchers, and speakers.  Plenary lectures are
              planned to cover
a wide-ranging agenda in geometric function theory,
              hyperbolic
geometry, dynamics, and other topics and workshop days early
              in
the meeting are planned to showcase junior researchers.

The Ahlfors-Bers
              Colloquium is one of a series of conferences on
geometric function theory,
              Riemann surfaces and related topics
that have been held every three or four
              years since 1965.  The
meetings' name honors Lars Ahlfors and Lipman Bers, two
              giants in
complex analysis who shaped the meeting's subjects over
              the
twentieth century.  The current core of geometric function
              theory
consists mainly of Riemann surfaces (two-dimensional spaces
defined
              over the complex numbers, such as the collection of all
complex solutions to a
              typical single polynomial equation in two
variables), Teichmueller theory (an
              approach to studying the
variations of structure possible for a particular
              Riemann
surface), Kleinian groups (the most important discrete groups
              of
isometries of hyperbolic three-space), iteration of rational
functions
              (which combines dynamical systems ideas with function
theory), and hyperbolic
              manifolds.  This core reaches back 150
years and meets or includes some of the
              most active specialties
in current mathematical research.
