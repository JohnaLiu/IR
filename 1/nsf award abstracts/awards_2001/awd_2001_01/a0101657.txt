Abstract    :
              E-Portal to Information Technology and Careers (E-Portal to IT) provides on-line
              dissemination of IT curricula and educational materials, best practices, career
              and certification information, and professional advancement opportunities. The
              portal, developed and maintained by the Northwest Center for Emerging
              Technologies (NWCET), aggregates content, brings together a community of
              interest in IT education solutions and provides them with adaptive e-tools
              necessary to efficiently reach and organize information. The Business Connector
              increases and enhances connections to practices and models for working with
              community colleges and other educators to develop IT educational programs. Also
              posted are internship and employment opportunities. The Development Finder
              provides educators and business-education partnerships links to smart IT Skill
              standards, online access to curricula and courseware based on the standards,
              professional development opportunities, implementation guides and resources
              developed by NWCET and other ATE projects. The IT Program Finder and Skills
              Locator links jobs to required skills, educational programs and certification
              in ways meaningful to students and re-careering adults. The portal expands
              linkages with professional organizations and business and industry leaders to
              ensure ATE presence in policy making and implementation.
