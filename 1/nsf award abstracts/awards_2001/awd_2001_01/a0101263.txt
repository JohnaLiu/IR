Abstract    :
              With this Renewal proposal, Professor Richard Saykallly seeks support for his
              research on laser spectroscopy of ions and water clusters.  The proposed
              research will refine and extend the water dimer potential, by characterizing
              and modeling out of plane librational vibrations expected to be seen near 500
              cm-1.  The refined dimer potential will then be used to calculate three-body
              interactions in the water trimer.  These potentials will then be used for
              advanced bulk water simulations, in collaboration with David Chandler's group
              at Berkeley.  Additional aspects, such as experimental examination of (H2O)8,
              hydrated proton clusters, EXAFS of liquid water, and nucleotide base hydrates
              will be examined experimentally. 

Improved models for liquid water and
              aqueous solvation will have impact in the modeling of protein structures and
              other biological molecules.  A greater understanding of liquid water remains an
              important unsolved problem in molecular physics and condensed matter chemistry.
