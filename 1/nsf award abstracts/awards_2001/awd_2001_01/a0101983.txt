Abstract    :
              Funded under the guidelines for Pilot Local Systemic Change Projects, this
              two-year project in the Anoka-Hennepin Independent School District #11 (MN)
              provides at least 216 hours of professional and leadership development for 17
              high school mathematics teacher-leaders who will pilot the Interactive
              Mathematics Program (IMP) instructional materials.  Working with Hamline
              University and the IMP Midwest Regional Center at the University of Minnesota,
              the District implements a program of teacher enhancement that includes direct
              engagement with the IMP materials as well as leadership development.  The
              leadership development is based on Michael Fullan's framework for
              teacher-leadership that includes not only knowledge of teaching and learning,
              but also knowledge of collegiality, knowledge of educational contexts,
              knowledge through continuous learning, knowledge of the change process and
              moral purpose.  In addition, high school administrators and counselors are
              involved in learning about a standards-based mathematics curriculum, as well as
              staff development related to beliefs about teaching mathematics and mathematics
              for all students.  

Project evaluation includes a student outcome component
              (comparison of pass/fail rates in the first two years of IMP mathematics vs.
              non-IMP mathematics, as a measure of student retention in mathematics), a
              mathematics department climate survey in district high schools, and classroom
              and professional development observations.
