Abstract    :
              In developing the concept of social capital, sociologists have extended the
              general meaning of capital - the investment in the acquisition or creation of a
              resource with the expectation of a return beyond the cost of the initial
              investment - to apply to social networks.  Social capital refers to both the
              productive benefits of social relationships for the economic status of
              individuals, and the forces that act to preserve the social resources of
              densely-connected, homogenous communities.  This project builds on the social
              network foundations of the concept of social capital to determine how 1)
              participation in certain types of organizations and activities affects an
              individual's social capital, and 2) an individual's level of social capital
              affects economic success, tolerance, health, and happiness.  To answer these
              questions, the project gathers data from a questionnaire sent to 1000
              households in Miami, Florida.  The data measure participation in political,
              civic, religious, work, and informal organizations; social network ties to
              persons in a representative set of occupations; and personal characteristics
              relating to economic status, health, happiness, and tolerance.  Analysis of the
              data identifies how social capital is created, what benefits it can bring to
              individuals, and if it is harmed by the decline in participation in certain
              types of organizations.
