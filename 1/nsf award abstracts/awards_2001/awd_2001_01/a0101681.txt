Abstract    :
              California manufacturers cannot fill their demand for qualified, trained
              technicians in electronics, welding, machining and other manufacturing related
              fields. Allan Hancock and Cuesta Colleges along with select industrial partners
              and faculty are joining California Polytechnic State University at San Luis
              Obispo to address this shortage by developing a Regional Center for
              Manufacturing Education. This project constitutes the planning phase for the
              development of this center. The planning phase is helping the participating
              members to create the strong linkages needed for the success of such a
              comprehensive undertaking. Planning activities are focused on organizing
              meetings with industrial partners to identify industry needs, offering a pilot
              workshop to community college and high school faculty, and reviewing all
              relevant data to meet industry needs for manufacturing while maintaining
              educational integrity. Once developed, this center will provide industry driven
              skill training for high tech jobs, will offer a series of activities to attract
              students into manufacturing programs, and will give those who wish to pursue a
              baccalaureate degree a seamless path to a four-year institution.
