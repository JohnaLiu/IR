Abstract    :
              Black Hills State University (BHSU) and Western Dakota Technical Institute
              (WDTI) have created a consortium including school districts and industrial
              partners to develop, deliver, refine and evaluate a network-based distance
              education model for the delivery of basic electronics curriculum. This project
              is designed to improve technology instruction, experiences and opportunities
              for juniors and seniors in six school districts. Key elements of the project
              include on-site teacher training course content and delivery; the
              implementation of distance education at participating high schools;
              professional and technical support for participants provided by faculty and
              industrial partners; technical experiences for students provided by industrial
              partners, evaluation of the program by all partners; dissemination about the
              project at the local, state and national levels; and/or credit at BHSU or WDTI
              for the proposed secondary course work.
