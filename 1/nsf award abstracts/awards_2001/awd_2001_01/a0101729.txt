Abstract    :
              This project is establishing a comprehensive program in chemical technology over
              a three-year period. The county where this community college is located is home
              to a large number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and the region
              faces a shortage of well-qualified chemical technicians, especially those
              trained in instrumental analytical techniques relevant to those encountered in
              local industry. Recent funding from NSF's Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory
              Improvement (CCLI) program has enabled purchase of sophisticated, modern
              instrumentation which forms the foundation upon which the chemical technology
              program is being built. The new curriculum incorporates the Voluntary Industry
              Standards (VIS) of the American Chemical Society. With this institution having
              an ethnic minority enrollment that exceeds 80%, a significant impact on the
              employment of technicians from underrepresented groups is expected.
