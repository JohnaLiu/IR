Abstract    :
              Structure of functorial compactification of
moduli of abelian varieties and
              their relatives

The investigator will continue to study the moduli of stable
              pairs with semiabelian group action and, in particular, the part which gives
              the functorial compactification of the moduli of abelian varieties.  The aims
              are: to get a detailed description of the structure of this space and the way
              the closure of the Schottky locus sits inside of it; to study generalizations
              of this moduli space to the relative case and to the case of other group
              actions.  The methods employed are going to be both algebro-geometric and
              combinatorial.

This research is in the field of algebraic geometry, but with
              a strong combinatorial aspect.  The main object of algebraic geometry is
              solutions of polynomial equations.  Started in the ancient times, in the 20th
              century it saw development of new and enormously powerful methods.  Its
              applications reach across the scientific boundaries to such diverse fields as
              physics and cryptography.  Combinatorics concerns counting, and is the basis of
              most real-life applications of mathematics.  The grant will also support
              education and scientific training of new PhD students.
