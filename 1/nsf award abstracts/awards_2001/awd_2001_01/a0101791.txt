Abstract    :
              Two 8 to 10 week modules, one focusing on cells and the other on reproduction
              and heredity, serve as the basis for the development of a comprehensive,
              assessment-driven, middle school science curriculum called "Science for Today
              and Tomorrow."  A curriculum frramework is developed for Life and Physical
              Sciences to be taught in Grades 6 and 7 and Earth Science in Grade 8.  The
              research-based materials assist students to develop a working knowledge of a
              core set of ideas that are fundamental to the discipline and ultimately to see
              how the concepts span the disciplines.  The student materials and the teachers'
              guides are enhanced with classroom-tested assessments and web-based content
              resources, simulations and tools for gathering and interpreting data.  On-line
              professional development materials allow teachers to gain content knowledge and
              pedagogical skills.  The website also contains an area that provides
              information for administrators including strategies for supporting teachers and
              another area for community members to involve them in the students' science
              learning.  The project builds upon the lessons learned in previous materials
              development projects at TERC.
