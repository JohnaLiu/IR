Abstract    :
              Social psychologists argue that individuals create social structures through
              interaction with others, and that these structures in turn serve to shape,
              constrain, or enable future interaction.  However, the nature of the kinds of
              group structures and decision-making that emerge depend on the sources of group
              legitimation.  For example, group legitimacy may come externally from the
              larger organization, or it may come internally from its own beliefs systems. 
              This project examines how different sources of legitimation make groups more or
              less hierarchical in their decision-making, and more or less flexible in their
              routine interactions.  To address these questions, it uses experimental methods
              involving subjects brought together to interact in a group project.  The
              independent variable is authorization by the researcher (i.e., external
              legitimation) or endorsement by the group (i.e., internal legitimation).  The
              dependent variables are the group's adherence to routines over two different
              types of tasks it is asked to complete, and the patterns of observable power
              and prestige that emerge in the groups' interactions.  Along with evaluating
              theories of legitimation, the results provide valuable information for
              organizations concerned with implementing team or group decision-making
              structures.
