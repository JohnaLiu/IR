MultiStore: A Research
              Infrastructure for Management, Analysis and Visualization of Large-Scale
              Multi-dimensional Data Sets

This project establishes a research
              infrastructure (MultiStore) for supporting integrated research in specific
              targeted areas of Computer Science, including Multimedia, visualization,
              Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Bioinformatics.  The research
              objective is to develop computational theories and algorithms for storing,
              managing, analyzing, querying and visualizing multi-dimensional data sets that
              are generated from the related fields.  The research components include: (1)
              Data storage and management.  We develop approaches to manage large-scale
              multi-dimensional data sets. Particular research issues include:
              multi-dimensional data storage, indexing, and clustering. (2) Data
              visualization. We develop effective graphics and visualization techniques that
              can help the user in information processing tasks. Particular research topics
              addressed include graph visualization and detecting clusters in a
              multidimensional data set through visualization.  The visualization tools will
              be used in biomedical image understanding and analysis. (3) Data analysis and
              querying.  We focus on geographical image understanding, analysis and querying.
               The particular research issues include geographical metadata/knowledge
              extraction, geographical metadata/knowledge representation and management, and
              geographical metadata/knowledge querying. (4) Data mining and bioinformatics.
              We develop data mining techniques for determination of protein structures and
              detection of gene expression patterns. Through these research activities, the
              fundamental understanding and novel techniques will be provided to support the
              management of various large-scale multi-dimensional data sets.
