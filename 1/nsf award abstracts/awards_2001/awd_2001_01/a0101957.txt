Abstract    :
              This project utilizes scientists from the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land
              Management, the National Park Service, and Portland and Oregon State
              Universities to provide middle and high school science teachers with authentic
              work in environmental monitoring and forest research at one of the National
              Forests.  The project provides a five-week summer research experience for
              teachers who will be partnered with field scientists.  Five additional days of
              professional development training are provided during the school year to ensure
              transfer to the classroom.  Teachers begin the program by working on an
              established project with forest scientists, and then create a short inquiry
              project of their own to be used with their students during the school year. 
              Novice teachers work with mentor teachers in implementing the research
              projects.  Mentor training is provided during the summer and the school year. 
              This project will educate 105 mentor and 210 novice science teachers over four
              years.  In the third year the project will be extended to a site that will be
              run by the University of Northern Colorado.  Teachers at this new site will be
              will be recruited from Colorado, Wyoming and Montana.
