Zeolites and other nanoporous materials are of major
              importance in catalysis, ion exchange, gas separation, and other technologies. 
              They consist of a wealth of open framework structures with varying compositions
              and degrees of hydration.  As Part of an ongoing study of the energetic driving
              forces which govern zeolite synthesis and reactivity, this work uses unique
              calorimetric capabilities in the UC Davis Thermochemistry Facility to determine
              energetics of formation, ion exchange, and hydration in selected
              aluminosilicate zeolites and their gallium and germanium analogues.  This work
              is completed by molecular modeling.  In situ calorimetric studies of zeolite
              synthesis form another focus of research.  Such synthesis is controlled by both
              inorganic and organic structure directing agents, and their energetic role in
              both zeolites and mesoporous materials will be investigated by calorimetry. 
              The overall goal of this research is an understanding, at the molecular level,
              of the factors which cause specific structures to form.  The Thermochemistry
              Facility and its diverse activities (including participation in an NSF IGERT)
              provide vigorous, rigorous, and supportive education for a large number of
              students and postdocs from many cultural, ethnic, and economic backgrounds.
