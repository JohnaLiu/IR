Abstract    :
              The workshop will address the themes:   design as a social process; social and
              political issues in design; social issues the design for a hopeful future; 
              instrumental approaches and methods for optimizing designs; and the confluence
              of ethics and design.  The workshop will attract 75-100 engineering design
              faculty from around the country, and it will foster discussion among these
              faculty of the issues cited.

This Mudd Design Workshop provides a unique
              opportunity for engineering design faculty to come together to discuss
              engineering design methods and pedagogy in a forum specifically for that
              purpose.  The workshop successfully fosters innovation in engineering design
              education and leads the way to the adoption and teaching of better engineering
              design methods.
