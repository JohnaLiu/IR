This grant, jointly funded by the Materials Theory Program in
              DMR and the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program in CHE, supports
              theoretical and computational research on the fundamental science and device
              physics of p-conjugated polymers. The research has three foci: (1) The PI aims
              to develop a complete theory of excited state absorption in photoluminescent
              p-conjugated polymers like poly(para-phenylenvinylene) (PPV) and
              poly(paraphenylene) (PPP), and of acene molecular crystals. This will involve
              understanding the nature of two-photon states seen in ultrafast spectroscopy
              and their relaxation mechanisms. (2) A goal of the work is to develop a
              conceptual framework for designing photoluminescent p-conjugated polymers that
              emit in the infrared.  Identification of real materials that have small optical
              gaps, but nevertheless, posses the excited state ordering conducive to
              photoluminescence is planned. (3) The PI plans to develop a general theoretical
              technique for calculating the relative cross-sections of competing
              charge-transfer reactions between molecular components of organic light
              emitting diodes (OLEDs) and photovoltaic devices.  The aim is to reach a
              quantitative theory of the yields of singlet verses triplet excitations in
              OLEDs and to understand the material dependence of the efficiencies of
              photoinduced charge transfer processes. 
To describe the electronic states in
              these materials, the PI will begin from the Pariser-Parr-Pople p-electron
              Hamiltonian for oligomers and molecular systems and perform calculations using
              the multiple-reference doubles configuration interaction  (MRDCI) and a
              diagrammatic exciton basis valance bond method developed by the PI.  The MRDCI
              allows proper truncation of basis states, while the exciton basis gives
              pictorial descriptions of correlated eigenstates, which in turn lead to
              mechanistic descriptions of the photophysics. Calculations of the
              intermolecular or interchain charge transfer reactions that occur in OLEDs and
              photovoltaic processes will be performed within a time-dependent
              Schr0101659

This grant, jointly funded by the Materials
              Theory Program in DMR and the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program
              in CHE, supports theoretical and computational research on the fundamental
              chemical, photophysics, and device physics of pi-conjugated polymers.  The PI
              will study the fundamental physical processes involved in, or that interfere
              with, the absorption and emission of light in pi-conjugated polymers. Quantum
              chemical techniques together with methods developed by the PI will be used to
              perform quantitative calculations that include the effects of electronic
              correlations. The work will contribute to the search for novel photoluminescent
              materials that are candidates for use in infrared lasers and research on the
              OLEDs is expected to predict dependencies of electroluminescence efficiency on
              materials properties. This project will provide a graduate level and higher
              learning environment for training in the chemistry, physics, and optics of
              pi-conjugated polymers.
