Abstract    :
               The Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award to Dr.
              Stephen Creager of Clemson University entitled "Ultrasensitive Amperometric
              Detection of Redox Molecules:  Fundamentals and Bioanalytical Applications" is
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities. The goal of the project is the development of an
              electrochemical amplification strategy which will have superior sensitivity to
              existing techniques. The amplification strategy is based on redox active
              molecules used as tags for detecting important biomolecules.   Additionally
              studies will be performed on a new class of monolayer-coated electrodes based
              on carbon.  These surfaces are predicted to have enhanced stability compared to
              electrodes currently in use.  The analytical developments will be complemented
              by computer modeling and simulation experiments.  The final stage of the
              research will be the application of the technique for specific DNA detection
              assays.

The research is interdisciplinary, challenging and original, and
              will have potential impact on the fields of physical chemistry, biochemistry,
              clinical chemistry, electrochemistry and sensor technology.  The research shows
              a  true integration of  University and Industry efforts.  Students will get an
              outstanding exposure to industrial R&D during the course of the project and a
              product with significant societal impact could well result.
