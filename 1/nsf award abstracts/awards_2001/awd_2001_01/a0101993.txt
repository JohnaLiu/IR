Abstract    :
              The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) is held yearly at
              sites alternating between the U.S. and abroad.  The 2001 Symposium will be held
              at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, DC, USA on June 24-29, 2001.

This
              proposal requests support for the travel expenses of ISIT participants from the
              U.S., Russia and Eastern Europe.  These participants would be individuals whose
              papers have been selected for presentation at the Symposium, but who lack funds
              and would not be able to attend without travel support.  It is proposed that
              the co-chairs of the symposium, Thomas Fuja and Prakash Narayan make the
              awards.  The total amount requested is $40,000, split equally between U.S. and
              non-U.S. Participants; this is based on 40 U.S. awards (averaging $500 apiece)
              and 15 foreign awards (averaging $1333 apiece).
