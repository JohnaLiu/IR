This project aims to use metal-organic clusters that
              approximate the shape of simple polygons and which can be self-assembled using
              well-known geometric constraints and appropriate multifunctional ligands,
              thereby building discrete and infinite structures based upon faceted polyhedra.
              The goals are to develop protocols for the rational design of a new generation
              of self-assembled discrete and infinite nanostructures based upon molecular
              polygons, and to characterize these novel nanostructures in terms of structure,
              stability, chemical reactivity, and porosity.

These nanostructured
              materials will have broad impact in a numbeer of applications areas that
              include sensors, green chemistry and pharmaceuticals. With the University of
              South Florida being one of the largest urban universities in the U.S., its
              exceptional ethnic diversity will provide broad educational opportuities,
              especially in areas of undergraduate education.
