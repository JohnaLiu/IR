Abstract    :
              


The Arctic Research Consortium of the United States (ARCUS) is to  provide
              organizational support for  Arctic sciences to develop, promote, and implement
              arctic research and education by nurturing the orderly growth of arctic
              research through tasks that cannot be accomplished as effectively by individual
              researchers, institutions, agencies, or by currently existing advisory
              bodies.

Specifically, they will provide services in four areas.  They are:
              
o	Arctic science planning-coordinating science planning for the arctic
              research community at several levels, including continuing examination of
              logistical requirements with the goal of improved access for all researchers in
              the Arctic;
o	Organizational support for research programs included in the
              Office of Polar Programs Arctic Sciences Section-the Arctic System Science
              Program (ARCSS), the Arctic Social Sciences Program (ASSP), and the Arctic
              Natural Sciences Program (ANS);
o	Development and coordination of arctic
              science educational activities; and
o	Information and outreach activities to
              disseminate information about arctic research to the scientific community,
              policy and decision-makers, and to the public.
