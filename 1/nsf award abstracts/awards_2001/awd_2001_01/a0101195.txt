In continuation of work that is presently funded by a one-year
              NSF SGER grant, the PI's propose to elaborate on this novel class of
              structured, sequence-specific heteropolymers to develop close mimics of natural
              SP-B and SP-C, that will be stable and biocompatible for in vivo use.  This
              medically-relevant research project offers potential for broad impact on the
              field of biomaterials engineering, by demonstrating the usefulness of
              non-natural, sequence-specific polymers for biomimicry. 

The aims are:
(1)
              To design, synthesize, chromatographically purify, and spectroscopically
              characteize the secondary strutures of peptoid mimics of helical, amphipathic
              LS proteins SP-B and SP-C;

(2) To perform in vitro biophysical
              characterization of peptoid SP mimics as spreading agents for biomimetic lipid
              admixtures, carrying out studies on a pulsating bubble surfactometer and a
              Langmuir-Wilhelmy surface balance, and making comparisons to LS containing
              natural petpides;

(3) To formulate a therapeutic, biomimetic LS replacement
              containing both phospholipids and SP mimics, that is effective, bioavailable,
              biocompatible, and more cost-effective than animal LS;

(4) To carry out in
              vivo testing of optimized biomimetic LS replacements in a murine model of RDS,
              in collaboration with Brigham and Women's Hospital; and,

(5) To deepen the
              present fundamental understanding of the relationship between LS protein
              structural features and biophysical functioning in phospholipid surface
              films.
