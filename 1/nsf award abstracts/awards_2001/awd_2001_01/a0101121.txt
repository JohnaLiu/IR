This award provides partial funding for the
              2001-2002 Emphasis 
Year in Algebraic Topology at Northwestern University. 
              The 
main goal of this special year is to develop some of the new connections
              between homotopy theory and other areas of mathematics, including algebraic
              geometry, cohomology of groups, algebraic 
K-theory, and A(1) homotopy theory.
               During the year there will 
be a series of short term visits by experts in
              these areas and 
a smaller number of longer term visitors.  A mini-conference
              on algebraic topology and its connections with group cohomology and
              representation theory will be held in the Fall of 2001, and an international
              conference on Homotopy Theory and its Applications 
will be held in March of
              2002.  Both will be at Northwestern University.  Further information about the
              Emphasis Year and the associated conferences, including invited speakers,
              schedule of 
talks, and housing information, will be available at
              http://www.math.northwestern/~pgoerss/emphasis.
