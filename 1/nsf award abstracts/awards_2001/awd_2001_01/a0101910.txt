Abstract    :
              The intended two-year LSC Pilot project is a collaborative effort of eleven high
              poverty districts in the Appalachian region of Kentucky and Tennessee.  Working
              together with universities and science rich institutions serving the area and
              building on positive results realized through the Appalachian Rural Systemic
              Initiative (ARSI), the districts have targeted K-6 science as high priority
              (nine of these districts are working with ARSI).  
The intended project will
              prepare a cadre of 22 teachers and 11 administrators at 11 pilot schools (one
              in each district).  Through summer institutes, academic study groups,
              job-embedded reflective tasks, and online facilitated discussions the teacher
              leaders strengthen their knowledge and skills in pedagogy, science content, and
              mentoring.  Quality of professional development is assured through the
              involvement of national consultants, scientist and science educators from the
              University of Tennessee, Eastern Kentucky University and Oak Ridge National
              Laboratory.
