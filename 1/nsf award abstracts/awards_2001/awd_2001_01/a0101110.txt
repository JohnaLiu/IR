Abstract    :
              This project proposes to conduct a study that investigates various aspects of
              leadership development in mathematics and science education while addressing
              four questions:

1.  What are the characteristics of current leaders in
              science and mathematics education in crucial arenas of       educational
              activity?
2.  What educational and professional experiences led them to their
              leadership positions?
3.  What do these leaders see as the desired future
              directions for mathematics and science education?
4.  From where will the next
              generation of leaders come?

In order to address these questions, the project
              will:  1) interview a systematic sample of mathematics and science education
              leaders in crucial areas;  2) review their curriculum vitae and products of
              their professional work;  3) analyze existing national databases that provide
              information about this leadership community;  4) review literature that expands
              understanding of leadership in the context of education; and  5) study program
              documents from leading programs of preparation of mathematics and science
              education leaders.
