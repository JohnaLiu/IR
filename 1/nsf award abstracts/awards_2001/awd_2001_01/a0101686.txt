Abstract    :
              The Lexington Collaborative for Revitalizing and Improving Middle Mathematics
              (LCRIMM) brings together Lexington Community College, the University of
              Kentucky, and Fayette County Public Schools to increase the quantity and
              quality of middle school mathematics teachers in the Lexington, Kentucky area.
              The project is addressing a primary barrier to improving middle school
              students' mathematics performance: teachers' limited knowledge of the
              mathematics needed to teach standards-based mathematics curricula. The
              collaborative group is addressing the knowledge base of middle school
              mathematics teachers by creating two courses needed in their mathematics
              preparation: a geometry course and a statistics course. The content of each is
              being aligned with state and national mathematics standards for preservice
              education, and with the International Technology Education Association (ITEA)
              standards for technological literacy. The courses are activity-based and make
              appropriate use of technology, collaborative activities, and real-world
              problems. Fayette County Public School teachers are involved in the development
              and team-teaching of the pilot courses.
