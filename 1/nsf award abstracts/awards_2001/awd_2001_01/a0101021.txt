Abstract    :
              With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
              Viktor V. Zhdankin, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
              Minnesota, Duluth, is exploring the chemistry of hypervalent compounds of
              iodine and xenon. His studies include the preparation and structural
              characterization of novel, stable complexes of hypervalent iodine and xenon
              with chelating nitrogen ligands, a search for catalytic reactions utilizing
              hypervalent iodine, the development of new oxidizing agents based on
              benziodazoles, and the preparation, structural study, and exploration of the
              reactivity of mixed phosphonium-iodonium ylides and imides.

With this
              Research in Undergraduate Institutions award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program is supporting the research efforts of Professor Viktor V.
              Zhdankin, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota,
              Duluth. Through the study of new structural types of compounds containing
              iodine or xenon, Professor Zhdankin will enhance our understanding of the
              structure and reactivity of these unusual compounds, develop new reagents and
              procedures for organic synthesis, and search for new compounds with unusual and
              useful properties. Undergraduate students from the University of Minnesota,
              Duluth and from other universities will carry out these studies.
