Abstract    :
              This project involves a data-analysis and theoretical investigation into the
              properties and causes of steady magnetospheric convection (SMC) events.  SMCs
              are extended intervals of elevated geomagnetic activity without the occurrence
              of substorms.  The objectives of this project are (1) to further our
              understanding of SMCs by statistically comparing their properties with the
              properties of non-SMC periods, (2) to further our understanding of
              solar-wind/magnetosphere coupling by using SMCs as a probe of the special solar
              wind conditions that drive SMCs, (3) to further our understanding of how bursty
              bulk flows (BBfs) transport magnetic flux, energy and momentum in comparison
              with substorm transport, and (4) to explore new ideas about why SMCs occur
              under certain solar wind conditions.
