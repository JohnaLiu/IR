Abstract    :
              The investigator studies the general affine groups and their related geometry
              (affine algebraic geometry).  These groups are the algebraic automorphisms of
              affine spaces over a field.  Group actions and their associated rings of
              invariants play a central role in this investigation. Of particular interest
              are actions of the additive group of the underlying field, or equivalently,
              locally nilpotent derivations of polynomial rings.  These automorphisms are
              related to several deep problems of algebraic geometry, such as the Jacobian
              Conjecture, the Nagata Conjecture, the Affine Cancellation Problem, and the
              Embedding Problem.

One of the simplest and most important mathematical
              functions is a polynomial.  A polynomial can be defined using any number of
              unknowns (variables).  The branch of mathematics known as algebraic geometry
              studies the geometric objects naturally associated with polynomials: a
              polynomial in 2 variables defines a curve in the plane, a polynomial in 3
              variables defines a surface in 3-dimensional space, and so on.  These objects
              can be remarkabley complex, and one wishes to understand their symmetries,
              their intrinsic properties, how they intersect, etc.  While aspects of
              algebraic geometry were already studied in classical Greece, it is a mainstream
              field of modern mathematics, both in theory and application.  Two areas where
              recent research has led to fruitful applications are in high-speed computing
              (solving large polynomial systems) and in cryptography (fast and secure coding
              schemes).
