Abstract    :
              Midlands Technical College is adapting and implementing the telecommunications
              education program developed at Springfield Technical Community College's
              Northeast Center for Telecommunications Technologies (NCTT). The Departments of
              Engineering Technologies and Engineering Transfer are adapting the NCTT
              curriculum to include a pre-telecommunications technologies component to be
              delivered by secondary teachers to high schools in Richland, Lexington and
              Fairfield counties. Laboratories are being designed to house the appropriate
              equipment, and Midlands is ensuring the ongoing operation and continued support
              for the work.

In addition to articulated coursework in telecommunications in
              local high schools, the project is facilitating the professional growth and
              development of college and high school instructors as well as recruiting,
              retaining, graduating, and placing students in good jobs. Partners include
              Springfield Technical Community College, the Northeast Center for
              Telecommunications Technologies, the three schools districts, CISCO, the
              Central Carolina Economic Development Alliance, the SC State Technical College
              System, and the Central Midlands School-to-Work Consortium.
