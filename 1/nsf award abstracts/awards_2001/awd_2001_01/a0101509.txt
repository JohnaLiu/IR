Abstract    :
              This project brings together a planning team composed of stakeholders of the
              Tennessee Valley Region to develop a comprehensive and systematic plan for a
              regional center for information technology education. The center addresses the
              need to increase the region's capacity to produce and sustain an information
              technology workforce. Particular emphasis is placed on developing human
              resources capacity to enable further automation and sustain the region's major
              industries of manufacturing, finance, and health care. The planning process
              focuses on three areas: development of plans and processes to build a community
              of those with an interest in information technology education, development of a
              detailed plan for academic program reform and faculty development in
              information technology education in the region, and creation of a program that
              engages a large population of potential information technology workers. The
              planning team that manages the process has representatives from the major
              stakeholders in the region including community colleges, universities, a large
              metropolitan school system, and industry partners.
