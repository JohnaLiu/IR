The ASH algebras (respectively AH algebras) are C*-algebras
              arising as inductive limits of finite direct sums of subalgebras (respectively
              corner subalgebras) of matrix algebras over unital,commutative C*-algebras.A
              C*-algebra is said to have the ideal property if each ideal is generated by
              projections.The investigator proposes to classify a large class of nuclear ASH
              algebras with the ideal property and also to classify the AH algebras with the
              ideal property.He also proposes to work on a conjecture which states that
              "many" nuclear,separable C*-algebras with the ideal property which are the
              crossed product of a unital,commutative C*-algebra or of an AF algebra by the
              integers is an ASH algebra in the above class.This project is related to
              Elliott's program of the classification of the separable,nuclear C*-algebras
              and to a problem of Effros and could have an impact in operator algebras but
              also in ergodic theory,in the study of the (noncommutative) dynamical systems
              and in geometry.
C*-algebras could be thought as collections of infinite
              matrices of numbers endowed with an interesting algebraic and topological
              structure.  The C*-algebras have significant applications to other parts of
              mathematics (geometry,topology,ergodic theory),to parts of physics (quantum
              mechanics and statistical mechanics) or to other sciences (the structure of DNA
              and other molecules).A complete classification ("enumeration") of a special
              class of operator algebras,called amenable von Neumann algebras,was given by
              Connes in his Fields Medal winning work.  This project has two main goals.One
              is to classify ("enumerate") large classes of amenable (nuclear) C*-algebras
              with the ideal property (an interesting technical condition) which are defined
              by a particular construction ("inductive limits").The other one is to show that
              many amenable C*-algebras with the ideal property arising from a completely
              different and natural construction ("crossed products") belong in fact to one
              of the above classes (of "inductive limits") that the investigator proposes to
              classify ("enumerate").This project could have an important impact in several
              mathematical fields including operator algebras, dynamical systems,geometry and
              also in some domains outside mathematics (e.g. in quantum physics).
