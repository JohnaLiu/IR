Abstract    :
              Over a three-year period, the Mobile Elementary Mathematics Initiative - Phase
              II (MEMI-Phase II) develops the Academy for Excellence in Mathematics
              Education, K-6  and prepares its members to lead and sustain elementary
              mathematics reform in the 66,000-student Mobile [AL] County Public School
              System (MCPSS).  The Academy will include a critical mass of leaders from four
              groups of essential stakeholders in K-6 mathematics reform:  36 teachers; 17
              school and district administrators; 30 business and community leaders; and 6
              post-secondary mathematicians and teacher educators.  The heart of the Academy
              is its Teacher Leadership Program and its carefully coordinated summer
              institutes, academic year experiences, and reflection seminars which deepen
              Academy Teachers understanding of mathematics and how it is best taught. The
              MEMI-Phase II builds on knowledge being gained from a mostly private-funded,
              three-year (1999-2002) Maysville Mathematics Initiative which involves a
              cluster of four inner-city and high-poverty elementary schools in the MCPSS. 
              As part of the Teacher Leadership Program, Academy members will lead and
              support school-wide mathematics reform in four additional MCPSS elementary
              schools using the Maysville Mathematics Initiative model.  MEMI-Phase II will
              directly impact over 180 teachers and their 3,600 students and it will set the
              stage for a district-wide elementary mathematics reform initiative, including
              textbook adoption, that would impact Mobile's over 2,000 elementary teachers.
