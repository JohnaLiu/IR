Abstract    :
              Foreman's work is in two directions: ergodic theory and combinatorial
              set
theory. In ergodic theory he seeks to characterise the complexity
              of
various classes of ergodic measure preserving transformations, using
              the
tools of descriptive set theory. In combinatorial set theory he
              is
continuing a program of applying reflection principles and Shelah's
              PCF
theory to study classical problems in infinite combinatorics.

Foreman
              investigates the phenomenon of apparent randomness in physical
systems that
              are deterministic in nature. A system can be deterministic in
the sense that
              the behavior of any particular individual (particle) in
that system is
              completely determined (perhaps by some differential
equations), but on a macro
              level, any measurement made shows random
behavior. Many systems in nature have
              this kind of paradoxical properties.
Foreman's other line of research
              considers difficult combinatorial
problems asked by people such as Erdos in
              the 1960's that remain major
questions in the 21st century.
