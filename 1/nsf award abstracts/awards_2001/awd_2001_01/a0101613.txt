Abstract    :
              This is a three-year project to adapt an integrated curriculum model, developed
              by the NSF-funded "Mecomtronics" program at the New Jersey Center for Advanced
              Technological Education (NJCATE), to develop an engineering technician
              curriculum. The four components of the project are Curriculum Development,
              Faculty Development, Student Outreach and Development, and Dissemination. The
              faculty development team at the College of Dupage has received mentoring in
              mecomtronics from the NJCATE. A Virtual Education Network is expected to
              facilitate rapid modification of modules and projects according to changing
              industry needs. Outreach includes workshops for 70 high school teachers,
              seminars for 60 college/university educators, and a high school summer camp for
              20 students.
