Abstract    :
              Prince George's Community College is leading an effort to develop and implement
              science and mathematics courses for preservice elementary teachers in
              Maryland's community colleges. Courses are modeled after courses developed
              through the Maryland Collaborative for Teacher Preparation and conform to a
              constructivist and inquiry-based approach. Mentors from two and four year
              colleges assist with the course development and continue working with faculty
              throughout the year. Courses are consistent with the National Council for
              Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) standards, national science and
              mathematics education standards, and Maryland state technology standards. The
              science and mathematics course development is part of a larger effort to
              establish an Associate of Arts degree in Teaching in Maryland community
              colleges that articulates with all four year institutions in the state. Course
              development is based on an outcomes document that specifies a constructivist
              approach. Students demonstrate their understanding through performance
              assessments and portfolios. Partnerships between community colleges and the
              Future Educators Associations at local high schools are assisting in recruiting
              students into teacher education programs.
