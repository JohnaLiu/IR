Abstract    :
              This project is developing rapid prototyping and time-compression techniques in
              a 'design for manufacturing' program for technicians. Tasks include developing
              and expanding nine course modules, offering workshops for faculty, providing
              technical and research experiences for students, and developing laboratory and
              computer-aided design tools. A unique feature of this project is its
              application to the entertainment industry, with additional applications in the
              biomedical/biotechnology fields. A strong information technology component
              includes the sharing of design code and files over the internet between the
              laboratories at the three institutions. The project is serving community
              college, university, and high school vocational technical students.
