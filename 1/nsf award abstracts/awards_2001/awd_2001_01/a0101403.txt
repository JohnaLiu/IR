Abstract    :
              Bellevue Community College and The Washington State Board for Community and
              Technical Colleges provide professional development for secondary, post
              secondary and adjunct faculty in information technology (IT) in Washington
              State. The workshops build upon the programs of the Northwest Center for
              Emerging Technologies (NWCET) to improve the overall level of IT instruction
              through out the State. The faculty are provided the skills to effectively use
              onsite, online, and distributed instructional delivery systems to make
              effective use of media-based instructional resources. The professional
              development also provides opportunities in the use and application of
              industry-identified IT skill standards and the NWCET curriculum development
              kits to align curricula with national standards. They develop the skills needed
              to evaluate, select and use media-based components in standards-based courses
              applicable to IT certificates and degrees. The website also provides
              collaborative opportunities for faculty to update and refresh current
              Washington State-approved IT related programs and identify areas for new
              courses. A special emphasis is on increasing the number of IT instructors by
              attracting IT professionals and instructors from related fields to increase
              their knowledge about pedagogy and content.
