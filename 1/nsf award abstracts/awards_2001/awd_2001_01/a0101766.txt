Abstract    :
              The primary applied research question posed by this project is: " What is the
              impact of inquiry science on student outcomes compared with the impact of other
              instructional strategies and approaches?"  The project will:  1) identify
              studies to be included; 2) review and organize the studies into clusters; 3)
              code and analyze studies within and across clusters; 4) prepare written reports
              and articles and 5) disseminate findings to researchers, reformers, educators,
              parents and the general public.
