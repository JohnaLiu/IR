Abstract    :
              This project develops a new certificate program to provide innovative training
              in the high demand area of web technology, including network fundamentals,
              client-server architectures, interactive dynamic multimedia human-computer
              interfaces and relevant development tools and languages. The program is unique
              in its coverage of the complete end-to-end web technology spectrum, from
              multimedia user clients to information servers. The project involves a regional
              collaborative partnership including a community college, four year colleges and
              universities, a public school district, and industries. The objectives are to
              develop, implement and evaluate new courses and educational materials, to
              develop a program web site to be shared by industry and academia, and to
              develop and implement "train the trainer" workshops for faculty. Undergraduate
              students are the primary target audience of the newly developed certificate
              course offerings. The project also provides professional development
              opportunities for college and university faculty, high school faculty and
              industry representatives as well as outreach to high school students.
