Abstract    :
              This is a three-year project to enhance the preparation of underserved students
              for employment in the fields of manufacturing communications and information
              technologies industries. The design to do this is to improve the teaching and
              learning process in participating institutions by incorporating
              technology-based curricular materials, preparing faculty in effective teaching
              practices, and developing work-related technical learning experiences for
              faculty and students. This initiative is building directly on the
existing
              School to Work Program (STWP) in the area of high technology. . The lead
              institution is the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) at Aguadilla. Other partners
              are UPR at Humacao and Bayamon, two 4-year institutions of the UPR system, 26
              public high schools currently participating in the STWP, and an array of local
              high-tech industries. The project is serving 150 faculty members and
              teachers.
