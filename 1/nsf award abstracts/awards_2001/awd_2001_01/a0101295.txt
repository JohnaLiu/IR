Abstract    :
              This is funding in support of a doctoral research consortium (workshop) of
              promising graduate students and distinguished research faculty.  The consortium
              will be held in conjunction with the ACM 2001 Conference on Human Factors in
              Computing Systems (CHI 2001), sponsored by the Association for Computing
              Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human Computer Interaction (SIGCHI).  The
              goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who
              will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the
              work of new researchers by having experts in the research field give them
              advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to
              attend their research conference.  Student participants will make formal
              presentations of their work during the workshop, and will receive feedback from
              the faculty panel.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and
              articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer
              interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis
              research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and
              whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Student
              participants will also present their work during the technical program of the
              CHI 2001 conference.  Extended abstracts of the students' work will be
              disseminated via publication in the CHI 2001 Extended Abstracts, which has wide
              print and electronic distribution.  Evaluation of the consortium will be
              conducted by ACM SIGCHI's conference management committee, and results of the
              evaluation will be available to the organizers of future consortia.
