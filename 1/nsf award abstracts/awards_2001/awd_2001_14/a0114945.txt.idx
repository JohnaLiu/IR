Abstract    :
              This project over a year period, will examine gender differences in the ways
              strategy use, speed of retrieval, spatial skills, confidence in mathematics,
              and conceptual understanding predict mathematics achievement.  The longitudinal
              study beginning in the second grade and ending in the fourth grade, will
              document whether gender difference found in early strategy use, spatial skills
              and confidence continue through three years of elementary school and whether
              they promote each other's development and mathematics achievement.  The
              elementary school years have been selected for study because although gender
              differences in strategy use, spatial skills, and confidence have been
              documented in elementary school age children, it is not clear how these
              differences may impact mathematics achievement.  If mathematics achievement and
              conceptual understanding are affected by these early emerging gender
              differences that would suggest a need to intervene in girls' mathematics in the
              early elementary school years as opposed to waiting until the middle school and
              high school years when gender differences become more pronounced.This project
