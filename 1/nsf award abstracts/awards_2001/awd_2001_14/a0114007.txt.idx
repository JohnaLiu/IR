Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to extend the knowledge of the single player
              stochastic decision problems, which have been studied for years, to develop new
              methodologies for multi-player games and test them on large-scale problems from
              the domain of e-commerce and supply chain management.  Such a methodology, when
              developed and tested, will provide a much needed resource to the corporate
              world for examining business policies.  The Internet revolution has brought
              about tremendous changes in the marketplace by tearing down the barriers of
              time and distance.  The competition among the providers of goods and services
              for luring the customers has reached an epic height.  Consider, for example, a
              homebuyer's request for a mortgage loan, which is now available to virtually
              every lending institution (e.g., a bank) in the world. All the banks (players,
              in generic game theory nomenclature) seeking to capture this customer are
              involved in a stochastic game, where they form their bids in anticipation of
              other players' actions. Based on the outcome of their bids, the players try to
              learn a strategy for the subsequent customers. In the above example, the game
              environment is highly stochastic and the game return is not necessarily of the
              zero-sum type.   The main purpose of modeling and examining such problems is
              to foresee the equilibrium point(s) of a game, the path of the game evolution
              which tells us about the game returns in finite time horizons, and also the
              time taken by a game to reach an equilibrium point.  In today's volatile market
              situation, short-term game returns could be of much more immediate importance. 
              Standard game theoretic analysis, when available, is geared toward
              characterizing the equilibrium points. Through simulation-based approaches to
              the study of stochastic games, as presented in this project, one can also
              examine the evolutionary paths a game can follow.
