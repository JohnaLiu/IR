Abstract    :
              The Project will (1) focus on results of large-scale K-5 science education
              reform on student achievement to further understand what practices and
              curriculum facilitate learning and benefit all students. (2) the Project will
              use Tennessee's unique statewide, longitudinal database to develop a comparable
              longitudinal database that includes several culturally diverse California
              school districts.

(3) Student achievement findings in Tennessee's
              standardized assessment will be linked to two NSF-LSC projects' teacher
              training databases.  (4) An additional database will be developed using one or
              more appropriate assessment measures that may be better aligned with new
              science curriculum.  (6) The TerraNova test will be used to allow value-added
              analysis in Tennessee and California and linked to the Stanford Achievement
              Test 9th Edition, used in California.
