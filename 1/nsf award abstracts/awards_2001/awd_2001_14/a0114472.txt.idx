Abstract    :
              This project seeks to impact K-8 grade girls by disseminating information on
              gender equity issues, barriers, possibilities and role models, via radio to a
              national audience. Through radio WAMC will develop a weekly segment and 4
              regional call-in shows for national distribution that will inform, enlighten,
              engage, and inspire listeners on the issues and possibilities of gender equity
              in the sciences for K-8 grade girls. This model will be shared nationally so
              that it can be replicated. WAMC will create, produce, air and distribute the
              weekly segments and call-in shows regionally through WAMC's 10 station-network,
              nationally and globally via Public Radio and ABC satellites, the Internet,
              mailings of CDs and the Armed Forces Radio. The Gender Equity segments will be
              incorporated into WAMC's award-winning radio programs "51Percent," their show
              concerning women's issues, and WAMC's current call-in program "Vox Pop."
                This project is a collaboration with an Advisory Board of professional
              women, nationally known for their involvement with gender equity, and The
              Capital Area School Development Association, a study council affiliated with
              the School of Education at The University at Albany, SUNY, which serves as a
              cooperative planning and development unit through which affiliated schools and
              educational agencies may more effectively define and fulfill their purposes and
              functions in serving the educational needs of their communities. Both will
              assist in evaluation of the program and the Advisory Board will give input for
              program content.   This project has the potential of reaching more than
              300,000 listeners per month in WAMC's regional area alone. Additionally,
              "51Percent" is heard on over 125 radio stations nationally via satellite to
              affiliates of the ABC Radio Networks, via satellite to stations able to access
              the Public Radio Satellite, and on Compact Disc to stations that are not
              interconnected. Additionally, the program airs worldwide via the Armed Forces
              Radio to 133 countries, and online via the Internet through www.wamc.org, the
              WAMC web site and  www.ThePublicRadioStation.com, WAMC's model non-broadcast
              public radio style program  stream.
