Abstract    :
              This Special Grant for Exploratory Research is for the development of an item
              response model that better accounts for cognitive change. Towards this end, a
              core-unified model, called the DiBellow-Stout Unified model, is applied to two
              domains. The first is a high school AP chemistry course called ChemQuest that
              uses computer models and exercises to sustain and augment the students' mental
              models of chemical processes. The second is an AP Statistics course called
              "Statistics: The Craft of Data Collection, Description, and Inference". The
              result of this research will be a better understanding of the core-unified
              model, a better understanding of how statistics and chemistry are learned, and
              a roadmap to possible future applications of the model in a wide variety of
              settings. The ability to better assess student learning is a key component of
              the utility of high stakes testing as measures of standards of learning.
