This SGER proposal is designed to take a unique
              opportunity to assess the use of eddy correlation (EC), a micrometeorological
              technique, to measure CO2 fluxes at the Solfatara crater in Campi Flegrei,
              Italy. The choice of locality was made in order to take advantage of a field
              season where chamber fluxes will measured concurrently with another methodology
              by an Italian collaborator, Dr. G. Chiodini.  This project has as a goal, to
              collect data that will convince atmospheric scientists and geologists worldwide
              of the potential of EC for assessment of volcanic fluxes and surveillance of
              volcanoes. Funding of the project will allow a student to be involved in the
              early developmental stages for using EC for volcanic work and will allow her to
              be involved in an international collaborative setting to study a problem with
              potential implications for global change and volcanic hazards.
