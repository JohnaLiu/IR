Abstract    :
              This project will work to enable the design, development, and testing of
              standards for entries in gazetteers and explore the complexity levels of
              gazetteers required for research in the humanities and history of computing. 
              Gazetteers are structured records about locations and their place names. 
              Digital libraries research is increasingly concerned with the ability to link
              place names and map locations.  Toponym-rich text and maps are lined
              effectively through the use of gazetteers.  Making robust gazetteer information
              to users and contributors of digital libraries resources is key to achieving
              communicability among diverse digital resources, as indirect referencing can be
              employed.  These resources can contribute to a variety of scholarly pursuits
              across a broad range of subject areas.
