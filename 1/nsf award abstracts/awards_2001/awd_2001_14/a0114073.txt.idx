Abstract    :
               This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program and the
              Major Research Instrumentation program will allow Rowan University to enhance
              experimental capabilities in the solid state sciences at a primarily
              undergraduate institution. The institution will purchase accessories allowing
              thermal measurements in an existing platform system. The award will support
              Rowan University to continue improving the quality and importance of research
              performed by undergraduate faculty, adding to the local research environment,
              and promoting the integration of research and education. The instrument will
              support research involving important outstanding questions in materials
              research in the areas of magnetic, superconducting and thermoelectric
              materials. Specifically, the requested specific heat probe will be used to
              investigate theoretical predictions for metamagnets and colossal
              magnetoresistive materials. The thermal conductivity capability will be adapted
              for Nernst effect measurements of superconducting multilayers with varying
              interlayer coupling. The thermal conductivity and Seebeck voltage will be
              measured for materials, which are candidates for thermoelectric devices.
              Student researchers will be involved in each of these activities. The
              instrumentation will enhance existing Advanced Laboratory and Chemistry/Physics
              Research courses. Many students will benefit from first-hand and original
              observation of the interplay between the various physical properties
              demonstrated by the systems under investigation.  This award from the
              Instrumentation for Materials Research program and the Major Research
              Instrumentation program will allow Rowan University to enhance experimental
              capabilities in the solid state sciences at a primarily undergraduate
              institution. The institution will purchase accessories allowing thermal
              measurements in an existing platform system. The award will support Rowan
              University to continue improving the quality and importance of research
              performed by undergraduate faculty, adding to the local research environment,
              and promoting the integration of research and education. The instrument will
