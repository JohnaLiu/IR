Abstract    :
              The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) at the University of
              Central Florida (UCF) has recently constructed a new large-scale structural
              testing facility.  The new lab will allow Structures and Geotechnical
              engineering faculty members and students to conduct static, fatigue, ad
              pseudo-dynamic tests on large-scale structural components and subassemblies. 
              This award will enable CEE/UCF to purchase a 128-channel data acquisition
              system to supplement structural testing equipment that has already been
              acquired.  The data acquisition system will be used to collect measurements of
              strains, displacements, forces, and temperature in the tests that will be
              conducted in the new facility.
