Abstract    :
              This is an award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program in DMR
              to the College and William and Mary. The award is for acquisition of a 7 Tesla
              superconducting magnetooptical cryostat for the study of nonlinear
              magnetooptical effects and magnetotransport in ferromagnetic thin film
              multilayers. Such multilayers are showing great promise in technological
              applications, but are limited by incomplete knowledge of electron spin
              lifetimes and the sources of spin scattering and spin-flipping. This equipment
              will be incorporated into a system for ultrafast pump-probe laser spectroscopy,
              including frequency-dependent and time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect and
              magnetization-induced second harmonic generation, to answer questions regarding
              spin polarization and spin and magnetization dynamics. The instrument will also
              be used in training of students at the College to study materials important for
              magnetoelectronics.  %%%  This award from the Instruments for Materials
              Research to the College of William and Mary is for the acquisition of a
              low-temperature, high-field magnetooptical cryostat which will enhance research
              and education in the areas of magnetooptics and magnetotransport at the
              College. The cryostat will be incorporated into a system which uses ultrafast
              pulsed laser techniques (with laser pulses less than one-trillionth of a second
              in duration) to measure how the magnetic properties of thin-film ferromagnetic
              multilayers evolve in time. In these techniques, a "pump" beam is used to
              excite the material under study while a second pulsed beam "probes", or takes a
              snapshot of the state of the system later in time. Such techniques have been
              successfully used, for example, to study chemical reactions as they occur, and
              have only recently been applied to magnetic materials. The study of the
              ultimate speed of magnetic processes and what determines the magnetic and
              electrical properties of magnetic thin films is extremely important for the
              design of electronic and magnetic devices such as hard drive read heads,
              nonvolatile computer memory and the next generation computer devices based on
              electron spin (dubbed "Spintronics" or Magnetoelectronics").
