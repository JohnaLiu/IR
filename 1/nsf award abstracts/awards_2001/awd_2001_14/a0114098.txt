Abstract    :
              This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program and the Major
              Research Instrumentation program will allow Ohio State University to replace
              the existing obsolete X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS)  with an new
              system having higher sensitivity, spatial resolution and novel sample handling
              features. The system will be located at the Center for Materials Research (CMR)
              and is designed for use by a variety of investigators in science and
              engineering departments, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Physics, Materials
              Science and Engineering, and Electrical Engineering.   The XPS systems will
              support a variety of federally funded projects, including investigations of
              carbon based molecular electronic devices (NSF), corrosion of light weight
              alloys (AFOSR, SERDP), conducting polymers and light emitting diodes (DARPA),
              zeolite based chemical sensors (NSF, DOE), and oxidation catalysts for exhaust
              gases (DOE). In addition to examining research problems from various research
              projects, the facility will be used to instruct undergraduate, graduate, and
              postdoctoral students on the applications of XPS for surface characterization. 
              OSU has a long history of education and outreach activities involving local and
              visiting students, including summer research projects for undergraduates and
              science education programs for K-12 students and teachers.
