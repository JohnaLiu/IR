This is a three-year cooperative project between Dr. Haimin
              Wang, the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), and the Solar Radio Array of Owens
              Valley Radio Observatory (OVSA), New Jersey Institute of Technology ( NJIT) and
              Professor Guoxiang Ai, the Beijing National Observatory (BNO) in solar physics
              research. This study will use high-resolution vector magnetograph data from
              BBSO and BNO to monitor the magnetic structure of solar active region
              continuously and use newly developed fast camera systems to obtain images of
              solar flares.  This is an important project, which can provide important
              continuous observations of the solar flares.  A successful study can advance
              our discovery and understanding of solar activity. This proposal addresses an
              important scientific question and meets the NSF objective of human resource
              development. The National Science Foundation of China and the NSF jointly
              support this project.
