Abstract    :
              This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research will allow the
              University of North Dakota (UND) to purchase a variable temperature automated
              x-ray diffractometer. UND is presently in the process of expanding and
              improving its materials science related research and teaching activities. The
              instrument permits collecting high-resolution x-ray diffraction data for
              specimens in the temperature range of 300 to 2000 K under a wide range of
              environmental conditions. In addition, this system will allow for accurate and
              efficient analysis of the acquired data using the latest software and databases
              available. This diffractometer will support research on a wide range of
              materials such as nano-structured materials, superconductors, magnetic
              materials, shape-selective catalysts, photocatalytic oxidizers, and smart
              materials such as Terfenol-D and Invar. As UND's only modern x-ray
              diffractometer that provides hands-on, affordable access to its researchers,
              the proposed instrument is expected to facilitate the research activities of at
              least three academic departments and two colleges at UND. Through participation
              in related research projects, graduate and undergraduate research students will
              have the opportunity to train in modern aspects of x-ray diffraction technique.
              In addition, through the incorporation of laboratory experiments into existing
              and new classes, academic students will also benefit from the proposed
              facility. Finally, because UND has one of the largest Native American student
              populations in the nation, the instrument will present an opportunity for UND
              students belonging to an under-represented ethnic group to experience one of
              the most versatile and widely used experimental techniques in materials
              science.
