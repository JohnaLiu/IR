Abstract    :
              This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports the
              construction of a suite of four single-molecule force spectrometers for
              development, training and research to be shared by the Departments of
              Mechanical Engineering, Chemistry, and Biochemistry at Duke University. These
              instruments permit the measurement of very weak forces (tens of picoNewtons) on
              the spectrometer tip as a function of its distance from a surface (controlled
              to 0.3 nm), so that the properties of individual molecules can be studied. 
              In-house construction of the instruments will provide the expertise necessary
              to modify and develop the facility to meet future educational and research
              needs.  The presence of multiple instruments provides the resources necessary
              to allow concurrent development and training while still meeting the research
              needs of the users. Students from each of the represented disciplines will
              receive training in the development and/or use of single-molecule force
              spectrometry, an area of growing importance in fundamental research,
              biotechnology and materials science.  No such general training opportunity
              presently exists on campus. The facility will be centrally located to encourage
              interactions and collaborations between users from all disciplines, and these
              interactions will be fostered through a course in macromolecular interactions
              to be taught and supervised by faculty from each department.  This award from
              the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports the construction of
              a suite of four single-molecule force spectrometers for development, training
              and research to be shared by the Departments of Mechanical Engineering,
              Chemistry, and Biochemistry at Duke University. These instruments permit the
              measurement of very weak forces (tens of piconewtons) on the spectrometer tip
              as a function of its distance from a surface (controlled to a fraction of a
              nanometer), so that the properties of individual molecules can be studied. 
              In-house construction of the instruments will provide the expertise necessary
              to modify and develop the facility to meet future educational and research
