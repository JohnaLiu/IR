Abstract    :
              The Materials Creation Training Program (MCTP) at UCLA will train scientists to
              be leaders in the design, synthesis, and production of new materials for
              electronic, computer, communication, and nanoscale devices. The training and
              mentoring faculty come from departments in Physical Sciences (Physics and
              Astronomy, Chemistry and Biochemistry) and Engineering (Mechanical and
              Aerospace, Chemical, and Electrical Engineering, and Materials Science). All
              are associates of the UCLA Exotic Materials Institute (EMI), which will
              administer the MCTP.  Many are also members of the California NanoSystems
              Institute (CNSI) - a state-supported venture that was created in 2001 to
              provide facilities and resources for materials and medical nanoscience.  This
              resource will be available for training and research of MCTP Fellows.  The MCTP
              unites a broad range of molecular and materials architects, synthetic chemists,
              and device fabricators, at UCLA and at partner industrial and national
              laboratories.  MCTP Fellows are supported for two years of their graduate
              careers, during which they will work in teams with UCLA and off-campus
              scientist partners using state-of-the-art instrumentation and computational
              resources. Novel training aspects will include a new graduate course involving
              all aspects of materials and molecular design, synthesis, testing, and
              modification of materials, device fabrication and testing, and demonstration
              and marketing aspects of practical devices.  This course will deal with science
              issues beyond the laboratory and will develop researchers versed in the
              importance of understanding materials properties across length scales, from
              molecular to macroscopic.  Each MCTP Fellow will spend several months or more
              at an industrial or national laboratory partner site.  Research projects will
              include the design and synthesis of new molecules, the transformation of these
              into molecular solids and polymers, the formation of new inorganic and
              organic/information composites, and the development of devices based on these
              new materials.  Fellows will be selected for excellence and diversity.  The new
              graduate program will be evaluated on a yearly basis by a board including
              university, industrial, and government representatives.  Community outreach
              activities will emphasize the importance and potential of scientific research
              and attractiveness of graduate education in science. The Materials (MCTP),
              Bioinformatics, and Neuroengineering IGERTs at UCLA constitute a new graduate
              educational paradigm, emphasizing multidisciplinary research encompassing life
              and physical sciences, as well as computer science and engineering.   IGERT
              is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating Ph.D.
              scientists and engineers with the multidisciplinary backgrounds and the
              technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of
              the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate
              education by establishing new, innovative models for graduate education and
              training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends
              traditional disciplinary boundaries. In the fourth year of the program, awards
              are being made to twenty-two institutions for programs that collectively span
              all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF. The intellectual foci of
              this specific award reside in the Directorates for Mathematical and Physical
              Sciences; Engineering; and Education and Human Resources.
