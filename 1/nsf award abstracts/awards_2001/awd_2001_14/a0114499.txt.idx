Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding to create a mathematical framework to design
              effective aviation security system strategies. Aviation security protects vital
              national interests, as well as passengers and aircraft. Key components of an
              aviation security system include baggage and passenger screening devices and
              operations. The goals of this project are to determine:  (1) how to measure the
              performance of aviation security systems, (2) where to deploy aviation security
              technology devices when designing such systems, (3) how to operate such devices
              optimally after they are deployed, and (4) how to quantify and optimize the
              resulting effectiveness of deployment and security operation strategies. The
              methodology will use discrete optimization models such as the knapsack problem,
              complexity analysis, and heuristics developed for intractable instances of the
              models to conduct the necessary analysis and to obtain the desired
              results.  The results of this research will provide a systematic approach to
              compare and evaluate different types of aviation security system strategies
              that incorporate both new and existing aviation security technologies. This
              approach also has the potential to be used to design and implement new aviation
              security system strategies capable of enhancing the level of security
              attainable given the security resources and technologies that are currently
              available or may be available in the future. Moreover, the results of this
              research can be used to quantify the value of new investments in different
              types of aviation security technologies, to determine their potential impact on
              enhancing aviation security at airports within the nation. Beyond aviation
              security, this approach may also be applied to other screening environments,
              such as computer security systems screening for unauthorized users and food
              safety systems screening for toxic levels of bacteria.
