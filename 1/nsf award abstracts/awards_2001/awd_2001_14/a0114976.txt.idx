Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop a resource for the scientific community
              that promotes expanded use of natural genetic variation in reaching the 2010
              Project objective of assigning a function to each Arabidopsis gene. At least
              four new sets of mapped Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) will be produced. 
              Potential pairs of parents from hundreds of available wild type accessions will
              be systematically screened for genetic and phenotypic variance and pairwise
              distances. The chosen parents will include wild lines not previously exploited.
              Simple Sequence Length DNA Polymorphisms (SSLPs) will be used as much as
              possible for mapping. Ninety-five individuals, from sets of 400 RI lines will
              be mapped at one hundred loci, generating a map with a density of approximately
              6 centiMorgans.  Seeds for all RILs will be publicly available through the
              Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center
              (http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~plantbio/Facilities/abrc/ABRCHOME.HTM) and
              maps and mapping data will be available online through The Arabidopsis
              Information Resource (http://www.arabidopsis.org/) by January 2004.   During
              the course of this project, undergraduate and graduate students and technicians
              will be trained in robotics, molecular biology, genetics, and quantitative
              trait mapping.  In addition, students in the Biotechnology Program at the
              Austin Community College will receive similar training through an outreach
              program.   Conventional genetics used in a small number of laboratory strains
              of Arabidopsis, will not be able to reach the 2010 Project goal of complete
              knowledge of every plant gene's function. This project will provide a way to
              map and identify genes in local wild populations of Arabidopsis that are
              important for adaptation to many different environments and are the result of
              many different evolutionary histories.  These different environments will
              include different soil types, day lengths, pest populations, moisture levels,
              temperatures, and other factors.  This will eventually lead to a better
              understanding of important adaptations to incorporate into the world's crops.
