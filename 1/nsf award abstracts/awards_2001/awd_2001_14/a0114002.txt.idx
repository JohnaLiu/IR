Abstract    :
              This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program will support
              the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) with the acquisition of a
              Fluorolog 3-22 Lifetime System from ISA/Jobin Yvon.  The instrument consists of
              single excitation and double collection monochromators, with fully automated
              entrance and exit slit control. The instrument will have an immediate impact on
              the research projects of four research groups at UCLA. The first group will
              investigate interactions between chains of semiconducting polymers and the
              dynamics of energy flow in aligned conjugated polymer/mesoporous silica hybrid
              materials.  The work should provide a new understanding of these important
              materials that will enhance the possibility of application in organic-based
              displays or photovoltaic devices.  The second group will study the properties
              of newly synthesized molecular compasses and gyroscopes, as well as explore the
              effects of aromatic ring rotation in conjugated molecules.  The information
              learned from these experiments will have direct application in the production
              of new organic materials that should have switching properties that are faster
              than the fastest known ferroelectric liquid crystals.  The third group will
              explore the synthesis and properties of novel heteroacenes, which also will
              have unique applications in electroluminescent and photovoltaic devices. 
              Finally, the fourth group will use time-resolved resonance energy transfer to
              study the spatial distributions of molecules deliberately placed in
              mesostructured silicas, and time-resolved fluorescence depolarization as an in
              situ probe of the formation dynamics of mesostructured silica films.  The
              information gained in these experiments will improve our understanding of how
              the formation of mesostructured materials can be controlled and directed. The
              simplicity of the instrument will ensure routine usage and great productivity,
              especially in an undergraduate educational environment. Undergraduate students
              in the physical chemistry and analytical laboratory classes will be able to
              routinely measure the fluorescence lifetimes of dyes and other molecules,
              allowing them to explore the dynamics of intramolecular electron transfer and
              other important photochemical reactions.  This award from the Instrumentation
              for Materials Research program will support the University of California Los
              Angeles (UCLA) with the acquisition of a Fluorolog 3-22 Lifetime System from
