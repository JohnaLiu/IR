Abstract    :
              The aim is to emulate the reaction processes used in nature for lignin
              polymerization, the setting of mussel glue, and insect shell hardening.  These
              polymerization and curing processes are enzyme-initiated and then they progress
              in a "domino" fashion.  In this project, it is proposed to use tyrosinase to
              convert natural phenolic precursors into reactive o-quinones, which can then
              serve as agents for polysaccharide crosslinking and protein-polysaccharide
              coupling.  To elucidate more mechanistic details, a combined biochemical and
              mechanical screening program has been devised.
