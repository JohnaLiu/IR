Abstract    :
                 This conference of the recently formed Society for Behavioral
              Neuroendocrinology is one of an annual series.  The relatively small meeting is
              strongly interdisciplinary, with approaches ranging from molecular biology in
              the lab to behavior in natural environments.  This scope gives an integrated
              view of the field of behavioral neuroendocrinology, and the hormonal mechanisms
              that regulate behavior.  The small size promotes interactions between
              attendees, fostering active discussions about research outside the formal
              talks.  About a third of the 600 SBN members are student members, so there is
              substantial impact of this annual conference on advancing the field by
              promoting interactions among young investigators.  This year is the first
              meeting in the West, to help balance regional representation, and it includes a
              new initiative to publish student abstracts and to get the best student posters
              into manuscripts for publication in a major journal.  A special panel on
              'Balancing Career and Family: Not for Women Only' also will discuss issues
              important to young investigators.      The promotion of students to attend
              this conference will have a substantial impact on their careers by exposing
              them to the latest discoveries and approaches, and making more senior
              investigators aware of their individual research.
