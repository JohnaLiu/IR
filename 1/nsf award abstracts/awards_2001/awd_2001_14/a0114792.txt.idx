Abstract    :
                Existing genefinders use information about splice sites and
              differences between exons and introns, but do not explicitly incorporate
              information about sequences known as splicing enhancers, which promote
              incorporation of exons into mRNA. This is a project to characterize exonic
              splicing enhancers in Arabidopsis. Although splicing enhancers likely function
              in splice site selection in many plant genes, and contribute to
              the regulation of alternative splicing, plant splicing enhancers have not yet
              been described in detail. Computational analysis of a database of Arabidopsis
              exons and introns will be used to identify candidate splicing enhancer
              sequences. The role of these sequences, and sequences from genes that are
              known to be alternatively spliced, will be tested in transgenic Arabidopsis
              using a splicing reporter construct. The activity of these enhancers will be
              examined in transgenes that depend on exon inclusion for expression. This will
              include analysis of the tissue-specificity of splicing enhancer activity and
              should provide an extensive database of information about the role of
              particular sequences in promoting splicing. This project will generate:   1)
              2,000 publicly available transgenic lines, available through the ABRC,
              carrying splicing reporter genes with defined candidate splicing enhancer
              sequences  2) A description of marker gene expression for each splicing
              enhancer candidate. This will consist of a description of all expression
              patterns and images of typical and selected patterns, available through
              the internet (http://www.tigr.org/2010-splicing/) and linked to the seed
              stocks  3) Improved genefinding and gene annotation available as improvements
              to the existing GlimmerM server
              (http://www.tigr.org/softlab/glimmerm/).  Effective use of the complete
              nucleotide sequence of Arabidopsis requires improved gene annotation.
              Information about the messenger RNA products of genes is incomplete. This
              project will provide to the scientific community both experimental data on
              splicing enhancers that will improve gene annotation, and genetic material for
              further study.
