Abstract    :
              This is a planning grant to develop a research plan to explicitly test the
              comparative effectiveness of an instructional approach that teaches phoneme
              manipulation versus and alternative approach emphasizing general pre-literacy
              skills. The project outcomes will provide systematic experimental data
              addressing the specific types of phoneme awareness instruction that could be
              effective in teaching disadvantaged preschool children the reading skills that
              will best prepare them for later academic success. The project will be based in
              Boston Head Start programs.
