Abstract    :
              	This project proposes a study of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system
              at Pratt and Whitney, comparing multiple sites (with different task
              characteristics) within a single cooperating industrial partner. The focus of
              interest is the apparent contrast between increasingly decentralized management
              practices on the one hand, and the widely-reported tendency of ERP systems to
              force centralized perspectives, resulting in "workarounds" that subvert the
              accuracy of central information systems. As firms move increasingly toward
              reliance on IT systems, inaccurate information may have serious consequences.
              Moreover, the potential for systemic rigidities imposed by ERPs is of concern
              in an increasingly interconnected, rapidly changing environment. These
              questions will be illuminated by a well-conceived inquiry.
