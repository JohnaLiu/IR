Abstract    :
              This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program in DMR
              supports instrument development and student training at Boston University. The
              new system under  development will enable, for the first time, the in-situ
              study with synchrotron x-ray radiation of materials' surface structure while
              undergoing plasma processing.  The system will permit both a realistic plasma
              processing environment and the necessary diagnostic access while conforming to
              the space afforded by a standard four-circle diffractometer.  An important
              advantage of the system is its portability, permitting transport between the
              synchrotron and other laboratories for multiple process characterizations. 
              Initial studies with the system will concentrate on silicon surfaces undergoing
              high density plasma etching to address the void of data available on the
              structure of such surfaces. Future applications of the equipment will be
              directed at compound semiconductor surfaces. %%%  This award from the
              Instrumentation for Materials Research Program in DMR supports instrument
              development and student training at Boston University. Faculty and students at
              Boston University are developing a system that will enable study of the atomic
              structure of surfaces as they are being bombarded by energetic particles in a
              set of processes known collectively as "plasma processing".  Such information
              will advance our fundamental understanding of these important techniques that
              are widely used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and microwave
              devices.  The system will allow the integration of a reactor used for plasma
              processing of materials into a high flux x-ray characterization facility.  The
              high flux of x-rays will permit atomic surface structure characterization
              during plasma processing for the first time.
