Abstract    :
              This project aims to enhance our understanding of the role that
international
              trade and U.S. trade policy has played in American economic
history.  This
              project focuses specifically on the antebellum period, from
roughly 1815 to
              1860.  (My previous research focused on the late nineteenth
and early
              twentieth century period, from 1870 to 1913.)  The short term
objective of the
              research is to produce articles for publication in
scholarly economic
              journals.  The long term objective is to produce a
comprehensive book-length
              study of the history of trade and trade policy in
the United States.  The
              research on the antebellum period focuses, in
particular, on three issues. The
              first issue is the extent to which the
United States possessed market power in
              terms of its cotton exports.  By
estimating the elasticity of export demand
              facing the United States, the
research will give us some indication of the
              possible economic gains from
imposing an optimal export tax during this
              period.  The second issue is the
role of import tariffs in supporting the
              early growth and development of the
cotton textile industry.  Economists have
              been divided about whether the
cotton textile industry depended on tariff
              protection or not, and this
research aims to provide greater insight into the
              role of import protection
during this period.  The third issue is the
              pre-Civil War political conflict
between the North and the South over the
              tariff.  This research will focus
on Congressional votes on the tariff issue
              in the antebellum period and
determine whether Midwestern economic interests
              played a critical role in
supporting the anti-tariff views of the South and
              thereby helped push
tariffs down from 60 percent in the early 1830s to 25
              percent by 1860.
