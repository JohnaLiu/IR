Abstract    :
              This IGERT program focuses on nanoparticle science and engineering, an
              inherently highly interdisciplinary field that requires researchers with a
              broad knowledge base of both fundamental scientific and engineering issues. The
              program addresses the lack of a coherent and well-organized Ph.D. training in
              this field. Faculty from five departments and six graduate programs at the
              University of Minnesota have come together to develop an interdisciplinary
              program transcending departmental boundaries to meet this challenge. At the
              core of the educational approach is the establishment of a new graduate degree
              program - a freestanding graduate minor program in Nanoparticle Science and
              Engineering. Several new interdisciplinary core courses will be developed to
              offer students a coherent and comprehensive set of courses.  Students enrolled
              in the IGERT program will participate in interdisciplinary research training in
              research groups that include faculty and students from various departments.
              Nanoparticle research will be conducted in five focus areas: Two areas will
              address the development of enabling computational and characterization tools.
              These areas will form the foundation for research in application oriented areas
              focusing on new materials, devices, and the environment. Exceptional career
              development opportunities will add to the appeal of the IGERT program. These
              include an internship program in corporate and government laboratories,
              international exchange opportunities, attendance of scientific meetings at an
              early stage in the career, an annual interdisciplinary symposium, leadership
              and technology management courses, and training in ethical conduct of research.
               IGERT Fellows will use the excellent infrastructure at the University of
              Minnesota, such as its Supercomputing Institute, its Microtechnology
              Laboratory, and its Characterization Facility. A unique collaboration with
              Florida A&M University focusing on the preparation of minority undergraduate
              students for graduate studies and their recruitment into the IGERT program will
              enable building of a diverse student body.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program
              intended to meet the challenges of educating Ph.D. scientists and engineers
              with the multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical, professional, and
              personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is
              intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing
              new, innovative models for graduate education and training in a fertile
              environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary
              boundaries. In the fourth year of the program, awards are being made to
              twenty-two institutions for programs that collectively span all areas of
              science and engineering supported by NSF. The intellectual foci of this
              specific award reside in the Directorates for Engineering; Mathematical and
              Physical Sciences; and Education and Human Resources.
