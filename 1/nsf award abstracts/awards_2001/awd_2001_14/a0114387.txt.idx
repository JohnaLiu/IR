Abstract    :
              Phylogenetics , the study of the relationships among genes, individuals,
              populations, and species, forms the basis for all of comparative biology. This
              IGERT grant will support a comprehensive, interdisciplinary graduate training
              program in Computational Phylogenetics and Applications to Biology.  The
              program involves 27 faculty participants from the computational and biological
              sciences at the University of Texas at Austin, and it will support 12 graduate
              trainees each year for five years.  Two major research areas will be
              emphasized: computational phylogenetics and applied phylogenetics.  Phylogenies
              provide a fundamental framework for all of biology, and present the
              computational scientist with many technical challenges.  Computational
              phylogenetics is concerned with the computational aspects of phylogenetic
              inference, and applied phylogenetics uses estimated phylogenies to address a
              wide diversity of biological questions.  The training program will involve a
              series of new and existing courses and seminars, a summer training program for
              students from underrepresented areas of science, co-advisement of each graduate
              student by one computational and one biological faculty participant, placement
              of students into well-established research groups in biology and computer
              science, participation in spring recruitment conferences and fall phylogenetics
              retreats, and opportunities for internships in the bioinformatics industry,
              national laboratories, and non-government organizations. The goals of this
              project are: (i) design and implement an interdisciplinary training curriculum
              for graduate students across computational and biological sciences that
              prepares students to understand and contribute to both sides of computational
              biology; (ii) stimulate interdisciplinary graduate research and
              interdisciplinary interactions in general between computational scientists and
              biological scientists that will lead to development and testing of novel
              approaches to unsolved problems in phylogenetics and their application to
              problems in biology; (iii) prepare trainees for their careers beyond graduate
              school and help them achieve visibility in the larger research community; and
              (iv) evaluate and improve the program in computational and applied
              phylogenetics to ensure its success beyond the proposed IGERT project.  This
              program will create a unique collaborative environment for graduate students
              and faculty from the computational and biological sciences.  IGERT is an
              NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating Ph.D. scientists
              and engineers with the multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical,
              professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future.
              The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by
              establishing new, innovative models for graduate education and training in a
              fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional
              disciplinary boundaries. In the fourth year of the program, awards are being
              made to twenty-two institutions for programs that collectively span all areas
              of science and engineering supported by NSF. The intellectual foci of this
              specific award reside in the Directorates for Biological Sciences; Computer and
              Information Science and Engineering; and Education and Human Resources.
