This dissertation enhancement grant supports a US graduate
              student, Ms. Lori Lach, working under the guidance of Professor Richard Root,
              with the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University,
              to conduct a study in South Africa on Argentine ants in the South African
              fynbos, and their effects on proteas and their arthropod visitors.

Invasive
              species are a threat not only to agricultural and economic systems, but also to
              the conservation of native flora and fauna.  Argentine ants in particular are a
              worldwide problem.  In the protea-rich South African fynbos native ants and the
              seeds they disperse are being endangered by the invasive Argentine ant.  Ms.
              Lach will experimentally test the hypotheses that: 1) an invasive species, the
              Argentine ant, has detrimental effects on pollination in the biologically
              fragile area of the South African fynbos; 2) that a facultative mutualism may
              facilitate impacts of this invader; and 3) that the invader may be exerting
              these effects because it is able to escape floral defenses used on the native
              ant species.   Dr. Michael Picker, of the Zoology Department at the University
              of Cape Town, will provide guidance on this project to Ms. Lach.  

The
              results are expected to increase the current knowledge about Argentine ants and
              their impact on fynbos flowers and their arthropod visitors, and provide
              additional information on the effects of invasive species on ant/plant
              interactions.  The findings should also have broad application to conservation
              biology and invasion ecology.

This project is being jointly funded by the
              Division of International Programs and the Division of Environmental Biology.
