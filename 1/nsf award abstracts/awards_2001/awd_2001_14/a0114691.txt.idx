Abstract    :
               It is proposed to conduct research on the design of output feedback control of
              nonlinear systems.  The design procedure starts with the design of a state
              feedback control followed by the design of robust observer to recover
              performance achieved with a state feedback.  The performance of such observers
              are usually hindered by difficulties due to measurement noise and excessively
              large transient response.  The principal investigator has shown that the
              undesirable transient behavior can be eliminated by designing the feedback
              control to be globally bounded.  The approach proved useful in achieving
              fundamental progress in semiglobal stabilization, sliding-mode control,
              servomechanisms, and adaptive control.  While the earlier work has emphasized
              robustness, the goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive theory for
              the design of high-gain observer-based output feedback controllers for
              nonlinear systems that aims at achieving both robustness and good performance. 
              The new element we bring in this proposal is the use of nonlinearities as a
              tool for improving performance.  Research tasks include: improved performance
              of the universal integral regulator, performance issues in high-gain
              observer-based output feedback controllers, multivariable systems, experimental
              testbeds, and a pedagogic  of the use of nonlinearities as a tool for improving
              performance.  Nonlinear systems under consideration arise in many
              applications such as mechanical systems, aircraft control, and electric
              machines.  Earlier results have been applied to the control of induction motors
              and a mechanical system known as the
              pendubot.
