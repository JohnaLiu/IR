Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will participate in a UK-funded research cruise to
              study a hydrothermal plume above the Central Indian Ridge immediately north of
              the Rodrigues Triple Junction in the Indian Ocean.  Large-volume water samples
              will be collected for particulate and dissolved thorium isotope studies. 
              Thorium will enable the quantification of rates of chemical processes occurring
              on particles within this hydrothermal plume.  The study also will investigate
              the processes controlling the geochemical fractionation of 230Th and 231Pa.
