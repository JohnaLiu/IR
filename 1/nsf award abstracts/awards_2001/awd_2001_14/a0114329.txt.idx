Abstract    :
              This IGERT project will establish a multidisciplinary graduate program in
              reliability and risk engineering, analysis, and management at Vanderbilt
              University. Twenty-five faculty participants in this program are drawn from
              three different schools: Engineering (Civil, Mechanical, Chemical, Electrical
              Engineering and Computer Science, and Management of Technology), Management,
              and Arts and Sciences (Mathematics). The research theme consists of three
              inter-linked areas: (i) large systems reliability and risk, (ii) device- and
              component-level reliability, and (iii) uncertainty analysis methods. As
              engineering systems grow in size, complexity and cost, reliability and risk
              assessment is increasingly dependent on modeling and simulation, rather than on
              expensive (or impossible) traditional test-based methods. Therefore, the unique
              features of the research theme are: (i) development of the modeling and
              simulation-based methodology for reliability and risk assessment, (ii)
              systematic integration of models and tools across disciplines, and (iii)
              inclusion of economic, legal, regulatory, and social perspectives in risk
              assessment and management. The research projects will apply these concepts to
              infrastructure, environmental, network, mechanical, and electronic systems. The
              educational goals are to broaden the training with multidisciplinary
              perspectives, embed information technology, include model integration and high
              performance computing technologies, and increase the number and diversity of
              reliability and risk engineers and managers trained in the modeling and
              simulation methodology. A number of strategies are proposed to achieve these
              objectives: multidisciplinary coursework and dissertation topics, laboratory
              rotations, industry and government laboratory internships, seminars, workshops,
              case studies, training in professional communication and ethics, undergraduate
              and high school teacher participants, aggressive recruitment (especially among
              underrepresented groups), and systematic evaluation by industry, government and
              academia. The program will include strong participation and support from
              several industries, government agencies and national laboratories, through
              internships, workshop and seminar participation, educational and research
              collaboration, and advisory committee. Through these efforts, the graduate
              program aims to become a self-sustaining center of national and international
              leadership. The IGERT award will lead to 35 Ph.D.'s over 9 years, fulfilling a
              critical need of the American industry in this important field.   IGERT is an
              NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating Ph.D. scientists
              and engineers with the multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical,
              professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future.
              The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by
              establishing new, innovative models for graduate education and training in a
              fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional
              disciplinary boundaries. In the fourth year of the program, awards are being
              made to twenty-two institutions for programs that collectively span all areas
              of science and engineering supported by NSF. The intellectual foci of this
              specific award reside in the Directorates for Engineering; Social, Behavioral,
              and Economic Sciences; Computer and Information Science and Engineering;
              Mathematical and Physical Sciences; and Education and Human Resources.
