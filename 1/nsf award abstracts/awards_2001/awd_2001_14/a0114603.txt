This award provides partial support for the construction and
              testing of a large-radius high-transmission double focussing multicollector
              mass spectrometer to be used for trace element and isotopic measurements by
              SIMS.  The large-radius instrument is designed to accept sputtered secondary
              ions from the transfer section of a Cameca 6f, but without any significant
              alteration in the Cameca's capabilities.  The end result will be a SIMS
              instrument with a single primary column and secondary extraction optics, but
              with two mass spectrometric "beamlines" for analysis of the sputtered ions. 
              This instrument will provide immediate improvements in many areas of
              geochemistry, cosmochemistry and geobiology at DTM. Support for this grant is
              shared between the Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program
              (EAR/IF) of NSF and the NASA.
