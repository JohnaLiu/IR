Abstract    :
              This workshop will bring together leading scientists and engineers who are at
              the frontiers of electronic device and circuit research and development. Low
              power digital electronics, microwave power circuits, wide band gap
              semiconductors, nanotechnology, terahertz technology, and optoelectronics have
              become the foundation of today's electronics technology. 

This advanced
              workshop will be a special forum to gather some of the most creative minds and
              leading experts from academia, industry, and government agencies, and to review
              the most recent and exciting breakthroughs in the fields, the underlying
              physical mechanisms that link these advancements, and to exchange views on
              future trends and directions, the market pulls and the necessary policy and
              infrastructure changes.
