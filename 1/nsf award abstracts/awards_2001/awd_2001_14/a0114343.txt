Abstract    :
              The Center for the Study of the Origin and Structure of Matter (COSM) aims 
to
              conduct research that has the potential to advance our understanding of 
the
              world through the lens of particle and nuclear physics.  The Center 
also aims
              to be a doorway for empowering a network of Historically Black 
Colleges and
              Universities (HBCU's) to participate in these highly visible 
science
              projects.

There are three components of the Center:  (1) Experimental
              research at the 
frontiers of particle and nuclear physics at all of the COSM
              network 
universities. (2) Building and strengthening a collaborative network
              of 
researchers at HBCU's in these research activities.  (3) Outreach to K-12
              
teachers and students, to invite and encourage these students to pursue
              
careers in science.
