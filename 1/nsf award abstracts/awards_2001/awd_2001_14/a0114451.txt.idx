Abstract    :
              This award  provides a travel grant to assure that approximately nine U.S.
              historians of all levels who have appropriate interest in and knowledge of the
              History of Telecommunications will have an opportunity to attend a conference
              on the history of telecommunications to be held at Memorial University of
              Newfoundland in St. John's 25 -27 July 2001. The conference is organized by The
              IEEE History Committee and the IEEE History Center at Rutgers University. The
              grantees will be chosen by the Program Committee on the basis of merit from
              among those eligible participants registering for the workshop. As
              telecommunications become ever more important economically, politically, and
              socially, it is important to understand better their historical development.
              The conference will bring together both engineers and historians for two and a
              half days of paper presentations and discussions, shared breakfasts and
              lunches, and optional evening activities and excursions.
