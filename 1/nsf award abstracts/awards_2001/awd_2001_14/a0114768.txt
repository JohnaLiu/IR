Abstract    :
              This project will analyze how algebraic concepts and representations are
              developed and introduced throughout the Chinese, Singaporean, and United States
              curricula for Grades K-8.  Recent international assessments indicate that the
              level of achievement in algebra is quite different in the three countries, and
              this project will analyze how the differences in achievement are related to
              differences in curricula.  Case studies of the Chinese and Singaporean
              curricula, as well as selected US curricula (including NSF-funded programs and
              others), will help explain these differences and provide guidance to curriculum
              developers.

The project will be conducted in parallel with the comparative
              study organized by the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction
              (ICMI) entitled "Mathematics Education in Different Cultural Traditions:  A
              Comparative Study of East Asia and the West." The ICMI study provides a broader
              mathematical context for the more specific work of this project on the algebra
              curriculum.  It also provides a pool of international experts in the field who
              can advise this project and additional opportunities for dissemination.  The
              results of the project will be used to improve the development of K-8
              mathematics curricula in the United States.
