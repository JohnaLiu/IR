Abstract    :
              This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program and the
              Solid-State Chemistry Program will help Northwestern University with the
              acquisition of a high-resolution magnetic-sector mass spectrometer with
              electron impact (EI) and liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry (LSIMS)
              ionization sources. This instrument will be used to characterize a wide range
              of materials science compounds such as mesoporous supramolecular molecules,
              porphyrazines, novel molecular species for electronic device structure, and
              other macrocyclic materials. As this research has moved toward larger and more
              complex species, the availability of in-house state-of- the-art mass
              spectrometry instrumentation has become essential for characterization of these
              molecules. The requested instrument will improve on the mass spectrometry
              capabilities for in-house molecular characterization in several ways: (1) the
              increased sensitivity for high-resolution mass spectrometry with either
              electron impact (EI) or LSIMS ionization is essential for determination of
              elemental composition of these species; (2) the increased mass range for mass
              spectrometry with LSIMS ionization will allow both low- and high-resolution
              characterization of the higher molecular weight species which will continue to
              increase in molecular weight as the research programs at NU progress; (3)
              air-sensitive materials may be characterized without fear of decomposition
              during transit to another laboratory.  This award from the Instrumentation
              for Materials Research Program and the Solid-State Chemistry Program will help
              Northwestern University (NU) with the acquisition of a high-resolution
              magnetic-sector mass spectrometer with electron impact and liquid secondary ion
              mass spectrometry ionization sources and with appropriate sample inlets for
              compounds with a wide range of volatility and purity. This instrument will be a
              significant benefit to molecular characterization in the materials research
              efforts in the Chemistry Department. Currently such characterization is done by
              sending samples to external laboratories. In-house characterization with the
              requested instrument will benefit both the research and the educational efforts
              at NU. The availability of the requested instrument for in-house analysis will
              increase significantly the exposure of graduate students to modern analytical
              techniques. In addition to gaining a more complete characterization of the
              materials that they have synthesized, students also will gain a deeper
              understanding of the techniques used for the analysis, the reason for choosing
              different ionization techniques, and the accurate interpretation of the mass
              spectra gathered from this analysis.
