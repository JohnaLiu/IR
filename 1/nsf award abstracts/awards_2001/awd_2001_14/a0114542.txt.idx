              ABSTRACT  SES 0114542 John L. Rudolph, University of Wisconsin-Madison
               School Science Epistemology And The American Public In The Twentieth
              Century  The integration of science into American institutional, economic,
              and cultural life has increasingly become a defining characteristic of modern
              society. The growing importance of expert knowledge and technical skill in a
              country that has continued to exhibit low levels of scientific literacy has
              prompted scholars and policymakers to devote greater attention to the various
              avenues of communication between science and the lay public.  As useful as much
              of this work has been, however, it has overlooked the schools -the one place
              society has set aside specifically for communicating knowledge about science to
              the public -as an important site of study.  Though traditionally viewed as a
              place where only scientific content knowledge is transmitted to students,
              science classrooms serve a more important function mediating the relationship
              between science and society through its portrayal of scientific epistemology
              -that is, the process by which science generates reliable knowledge about the
              world.  Perceptions of how science works in the abstract provide the backdrop
              against which local, context-specific scientific issues are viewed, and
              ultimately resolved, by the public.  To date, few researchers have looked
              carefully at or considered the social implications of these school-science
              epistemologies.    This research project provides a historical analysis of
              the image of science in schools over the course of the twentieth century.  The
              specific aim is to understand how the curricular portrayal of scientific
              epistemology has been used to define the role of science in American society
              and culture.  Dr. Rudolph uses rich archival resources of both key individuals
              and institutions to examine how the construction of science in education has
              varied from the Progressive era 's view of the scientific method as the sole
              path to objective knowledge to the more recent images of science as only one
              among many, equally legitimate ways of knowing.  He is interested in how
              portrayals of science in the classroom -through textbook, homework, and lab
              -both have situated the individual with respect to the scientific community and
              its practices and how science as an institution has been placed within the
              larger social and political structures of the time.  With this work, Dr.
              Rudolph provides a detailed case-study history of United States science
              education in its extended social context that promises to give insight into how
              schools and the school curriculum have functioned in the past and how they
              might be made to function better as a bridge between science and the lay public
              in the future.
