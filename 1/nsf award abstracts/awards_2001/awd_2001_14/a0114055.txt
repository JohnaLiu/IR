This grant provides three-years of partial salary support
              for the Rare Gas Geochronology Laboratory at the University of
              Wisconsin-Madison.  This will comprise the initial (phase I) technician support
              for this laboratory that is under the supervision of Dr. Brad Singer. The new
              technician will be a full-time employee whose responsibilities shall include:
              (1) day-to-day operation and maintenance of ultra-high vacuum, mass
              spectrometry, laser, furnace, electronic, and computer systems, (2) scheduling
              analytical work, training students and outside users, (3) supervision of sample
              preparation, including training and oversight of graduate students, (4)
              irradiation and safe handling of radioactive and hazardous materials, (5)
              development of the UW-Madison nuclear reactor for 40Ar/39Ar geochronology, (6)
              completing computer automation of the gas extraction and mass spectrometry
              system that was built by Dr. Singer, and (7) archiving and management of
              analytical data. In addition, the new technician will assist in implementing
              capabilities for the measurement of radiogenic 4He and cosmogenic 3He. The
              laboratory is currently engaged in, or beginning, several research projects
              that span many Earth Science disciplines and involve faculty plus graduate or
              undergraduate students from UW-Madison or collaboration with other
              institutions. The technician will contribute to bringing the laboratory  from
              its developmental state to one of full productivity.  Moreover, the technician
              will help to expand the capabilities of current equipment so that the
              laboratory may fulfill its potential in both geo- and thermo-chronology.
