Abstract    :
              Phase III Western Alliance to Expand Student Opportunities (WAESO)
              LSAMP proposes to (1) institutionalize its highly successful LSAMP Phase II
              activities, (2) double once again the degree rate from our current baseline to
              achieve 2,260  underrepresented minority science, mathematics, engineering,
              andtechnology (SMET) BS degrees in the year 2006, and (3) expand and link
              LSAMP graduates and Phase III LSAMP participating underrepresented minority
              SMET undergraduate students to our  MGE@MSA AGEP and other AGEPs with high
              technology products that will help our  students and graduates both in our
              service region and nationally. The Phase III WAESO LSAMP is the undergraduate
              component of a comprehensive, concerted, sequenced  effort that helps students
              beginning in secondary school throughundergraduate, graduate school, and
              beyond, including the transition of college sophomores, juniors, and seniors
               toward graduate school and the development of high technology products with
               application or dissemination both regionally and nationally. Although, our
              LSAMP  NSF funds will focus solely on undergraduate students, we will use
              non-NSF funds  to support thousands of pre-college students and use both NSF
              AGEP and non-NSF  funds to help hundreds of graduate students and graduates of
              Ph.D. or Master level  programs beginning in the 7th grade and going through
              the doctorate and even beyond  to faculty status or careers in the corporate
              or government sectors.  Some of the unique and highly effective features of
              our Phase II LSAMP that will  be institutionalized in Phase III WAESO lie
              within the sequence and integration of  the various levels of the project. For
              example, (1) Integrating pre-college and graduate study with our core
              undergraduate project in a coherent and effective way; (2) Giving scientists,
              specifically faculty members who are  currently working with students in
              classrooms and laboratories and who review and  rank projects which in turn
              also come from the field and need to compete for funds,  primary control over
              project activities and the allocation of funds, including the flexibility to
              make mid-course corrections in the funding of deserving (or undeserving)
              projects, through their participation in the operational committees; (3) Using
              high-technology to produce and distribute underrepresented
              minority-focused SMET materials as well as to coordinate project components
              over great distances  through the use of DVDs, CD-ROMs, the Internet, and the
              World Wide Web; and (4) Developing and maintain special programmatic
              initiatives directed toward each of our participating student populations,
              including American Indians. Thanks to strong long-term institutional support,
              we have the ability to not only meet the basic  LSAMP cost-sharing
              requirements but, even more importantly, to meet the institutionalization
              costs of the new, third phase of the LSAMP program.  Based on the successes
              of Phase I in doubling the number of graduates per year of our target
              population and being above a similar doubling goal in Phase II, we propose to
              take  on the formidable task of achieving B.S. degree rates reflective of the
              substantial  underrepresented minority population of our region which is 25.8%
              American Indian, African American, and Hispanic. Thus, our long-term numerical
              goal in the year 2011 of 2,858 SMET B.S. degrees awarded to American Indian,
              African American, and Hispanics as accomplishing parity with our regional
              population of these Americans. For the purposes of Phase III, we are
              establishing a goal of doubling the degree rate  once again from our current
              baseline to achieve 2,260 degrees in the year 2006, which is well on the way
              to achieving parity.
