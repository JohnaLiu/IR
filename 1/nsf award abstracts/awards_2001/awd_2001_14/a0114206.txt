Abstract    :
              This symposium will bring together US, Icelandic, European, and Japanese
              investigators who have been working in Iceland.  The symposium will synthesize
              the present state of knowledge regarding the Iceland plume and its mantle
              structure and melting process, its crustal structure and volcanism, and its
              interaction with adjacent spreading centers.  It will also identify the
              outstanding scientific problems that remain to be addressed and recommend
              future research to solve these problems.  The symposium will be supported by
              the National Science Foundation, the Icelandic Research Council, and the
              Svartsengi Geothermal Power Plant of Iceland.
