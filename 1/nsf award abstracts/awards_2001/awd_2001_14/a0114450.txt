Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin in La Crosse will
              acquire a three-laser heterodyne frequency measurement system.  The measurement
              system will allow the investigators to measure the wavelengths, frequencies and
              characteristics (relative intensity, frequency offset and polarization) of
              newly discovered laser emissions in the far infrared region.  This equipment
              will then be used in conjunction with an existing optically pumped molecular
              laser (OPML) and Stark spectrometer.  With this enhanced laser system, the
              principal investigators will investigate molecules that are currently of
              interstellar and atmospheric interest.  

The addition of new laser emissions
              greatly enhances the scope of optically pumped molecular lasers.  By opening up
              the short-wavelength portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, complete coverage
              of the entire far infrared region is accomplished and a number of spectroscopic
              techniques will benefit.  These studies will involve the active participation
              of undergraduates at the University of Wisconsin-LaCrosse.
