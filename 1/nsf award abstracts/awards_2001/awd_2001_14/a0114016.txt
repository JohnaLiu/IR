Abstract    :
              This project relieves the shortage of qualified information assurance personnel
              by providing
generous financial support for graduate/undergraduate students as
              participants in a rigorous academic program. The highlights of the program
              include: faculty committed to working with undergraduates in a research
              environment, immediate integration of students in existing research programs in
              information assurance, and a cyber research seminar emphasizing critical
              thinking, leadership, and communication skills. The program includes expanding
              horizons seminars presented by experts in the field of information assurance
              and an ethics component, in the form of an integrated sequence of lectures and
              discussion. The goal is to develop professional skills through mentoring,
              training, and experience.
