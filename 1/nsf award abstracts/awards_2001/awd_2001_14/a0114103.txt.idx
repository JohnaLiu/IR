Abstract    :
              This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports
              instrument acquisition of a Fourier Transform Infrared Imaging System for
              Multicomponent Polymer Dynamics Research and Student Education at the
              University of Akron. The investigators will assemble one of the world's most
              powerful FTIR imaging systems that will have unprecedented sensitivity and
              speed for spatially resolved spectroscopic measurements and be a uniquely
              powerful technique for studying all types of polymer diffusion in various
              materials including nano-networks and nanocomposites and for studying phase
              separations and confinement effects. The acquisition of the proposed instrument
              will provide the timely training of a future generation of scientists skillful
              in vibrational spectroscopic imaging that will soon replace the existing 5,000
              infrared microscopes in the world.  The research will provide a novel learning
              experience in polymer science and engineering, enabling the largest
              interdisciplinary polymer program at University of Akron to be the first to
              possess this emerging technology for research and education.  This award from
