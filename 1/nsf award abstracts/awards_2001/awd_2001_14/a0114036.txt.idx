Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to develop new techniques to handle
              uncertainty in object-oriented dynamic databases. The approach consists of
              developing a new data model and associated algebra; developing query
              optimization techniques for inexact queries; and development of indexing
              methods to support probabilistic uncertainty in dynamic databases. This
              research effort develops new theory, tools and technology to support various
              types of probabilistic uncertainty in object-oriented dynamic databases. The
              experimental research is linked to spatial databases with applications in the
              field of Geographic Information Systems. By adding support for uncertainty in
              database management systems, this research project will substantially increase
              the power and flexibility of database management in a broad class of business,
              social, scientific and engineering endeavors where uncertainty is measured and
              used.  http://www.vislab.ucr.edu/intro.html
