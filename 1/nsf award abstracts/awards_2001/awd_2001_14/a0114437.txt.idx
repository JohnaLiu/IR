Abstract    :
              This IGERT award supports the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate
              training program of education and research in environmental economics
              (including resource economics), integrating environmental science with
              economics.  The vision of the Program is to provide the first truly
              multidisciplinary Ph.D. program in environmental economics, a program that does
              not compromise the depth of economics education nor the depth of education in a
              companion natural science discipline.  Most Ph.D. programs in environmental
              economics are either very narrowly economic in orientation or disciplinarily
              broad, with some strength in a variety of disciplines, including economics. 
              This new IGERT program seeks a third path, producing Ph.D.s who are as well
              trained in economics as any graduating from a good economics department but who
              also have Ph.D. level depth in one of four complementary fields of natural
              science: climate, conservation biology, hydrology and marine science.  The
              complementary science fields specified are not intended to be comprehensive but
              rather to reflect faculty strengths at UCSB.  IGERT fellowship support
              facilitates the additional curricular burden of significant coursework in a
              companion area of natural science. During the first half of their nominal five
              years in the Program, students acquire strength in economics and their
              companion natural science discipline, primarily through coursework.  As
              students move into the second half of their tenure in the Program, they become
              absorbed in research and research workshops, culminating in the writing of the
              dissertation.  In addition to coursework, three features of the curriculum are
              designed to build multidisciplinary strength: (i) research seminars in
              environmental policy, environmental economics, and the chosen complementary
              field of natural science; (ii) development of an original empirical paper as an
              intermediate step to the dissertation; and (iii) assisting faculty with the
              supervision of Masters students involved in group thesis work.  Other aspects
              of the program are designed to strengthen student research skills, introduce
              issues of ethics in research and develop skills for entering the job market. It
              is the goal of this IGERT Program to train the next generation of environmental
              economists, people who can truly bridge the gap between economics and the
              natural sciences that underlie environmental problems.  The program described
              is comprehensive, designed to turn out research leaders and innovative
              thinkers.  These graduates will enrich the workplace, both academic and
              nonacademic.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of
              educating Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the multidisciplinary backgrounds
              and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career
              demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in
              graduate education by establishing new, innovative models for graduate
              education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that
              transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. In the fourth year of the
              program, awards are being made to twenty-two institutions for programs that
              collectively span all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF. The
              intellectual foci of this specific award reside in the Directorates for Social,
              Behavioral, and Economic Sciences; Geosciences; Biological Sciences; and
              Education and Human Resources.
