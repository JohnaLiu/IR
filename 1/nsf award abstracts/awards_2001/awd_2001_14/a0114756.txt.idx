Abstract    :
              In Phase II, SUNY LSAMP will be building on the infrastructure, research base
              and replicable models from Phase I and will scale up those programs with
              approaches that work and advance new initiative to address those areas of
              greatest challenge.  The goals of SUNY LSAMP are to double the number of
              underrepresented minority students getting bachelors degrees in SMET
              disciplines; to encourage students to graduate study, into the professoriate
              and into the SMET workforce; to encourage curricular and pedagogical change in
              SMET disciplines and to institutionalize SUNY LSAMP goals. Strong emphasis will
              be placed on strengthening the program at key transition points (high school to
              college, 2- to 4-year college and undergraduate to graduate study), on
              replicating innovative program models, providing comprehensive student support
              services, continuing to build undergraduate research experience and
              strengthening the SUNY LSAMP Alliance.  SUNY LSAMP is a coalition of sixteen
              four-year and community colleges within the State University of New York (SUNY)
              system and program partners.  Key program partners are Computer Associates, BP
              Amoco, Brookhaven National Laboratory; the New York State Collegiate Science
              and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP), and the SUNY Alliance for Graduate
              Education and the Professoriate (SUNY AGEP).
