Abstract    :
              Basic information on the physical properties of materials, such as charge
              transport, specific heat, and magnetization, are increasingly important in a
              number of different fields. This award from the Instrumentation for Materials
              Research program will be used to purchase a Physical Property Measurement
              System from Quantum Design that will form the core capability of a Physical
              Properties Characterization Facility at UCR. With this instrument, the specific
              heat, electrical transport, and AC/torque magnetometry can be measured as a
              function of temperature from 0.5 K to 350 K and field up to 14 T. Broad
              interest has been expressed in the capability of this facility by researchers
              in condensed matter physics, chemistry, engineering, and the life sciences from
              UCR, several local colleges, and a government laboratory. The instrument also
              supports UCR's initiative in materials science. Some of the systems of interest
              include: biomaterials and pi-conjugated macromolecular materials with
              well-defined architectures, lanthanide and actinide intermetallic systems,
              exotic magnetic and superconducting materials, Fullerene chemistry, and
              molecular metals such Phenalenyl-based neutral radical conductors. Along with
              the research program, the instrument will be used in a required advanced
              laboratory course for undergraduates majoring in Physics.  In recent years,
              there is much interest in exotic materials that exhibit new fundamental
              principles of nature, which can sometimes be exploited to yield useful
              products. As new systems are synthesized, characterizing their basic properties
              such as the way electric charge moves, the thermal response, and the magnetic
              response is important. Funds from this award from the Instrumentation for
              Materials Research program will be used to purchase a Physical Property
              Measurement System from Quantum Design. This instrument is fully automated and
              has sophisticated control systems for performing these measurements on small
              samples over a large range of temperatures and as a function of applied
              magnetic field. Scientists working in condensed matter physics, chemistry,
              materials science, and the life sciences often deal with new materials or
              systems where this type of information is useful, and we expect researchers
              from several departments at UCR, some local colleges, and a government
              laboratory to use this equipment. The instrument will also be used in a
              required advanced laboratory course for undergraduates majoring in Physics.
