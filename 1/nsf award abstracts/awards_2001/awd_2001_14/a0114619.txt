In a preceding project supported by NSF, mathematical
              justification and numerical feasibility of neural networks (NNs) with long- and
              short-term memories (LASTMs) and risk-sensitive NNs have been established for
              adaptive and robust identification of dynamic systems respectively.  Equally
              important, an adaptive method of training NNs that has the ability to select a
              training criterion most suitable for the training data and to avoid poor local
              minima of the selected training criterion has been discovered.  The objective
              of the new project is to further develop these ideas and methodologies, conduct
              thorough benchmarking studies, and develop more powerful algorithms in order to
              complete establishing this neurocomputing approach to robust and/or adaptive
              identification of dynamic systems.

Among the key tasks are: (1) development
              of an online recursive algorithm for adjusting linear weights of an NN with
              LASTMs in the presence of multicollinearity, using possibly a combination of
              the Kalman filter and ridge regression; (2) comparison of adaptive risk-seeking
              training method against existing methods using robust estimation criteria from
              statistics; (3) development of an algorithm using risk-seeking and
              risk-averting criteria alternately in identifying a dynamic system with a fine
              feature or an under-represented segment in the presence of outlying measurement
              noises; (4) development of a theory of the convergence properties of the
              adaptive risk-averting training method conceived in the preceding project; (5)
              combination of the above adaptive and robust system identification ideas for
              identification of a dynamic system in an uncertain environment.
