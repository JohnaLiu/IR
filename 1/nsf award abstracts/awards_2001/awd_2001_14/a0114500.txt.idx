              of Time-Periodic Differential-Delay Equations: Applications to High-Speed
              Machining Models  Project Abstract  	This project concerns the development
              and application of a unique method for the symbolic computation of linear
              stability boundaries in time-periodic differential-delay equations (DDEs). 
              Such equations arise in several linearized models of chatter instability in
              high-speed machining, including milling with arbitrary immersion level and
              turning with modulated speed or impedance, as well as in other important
              engineering and scientific applications.  In addition, the local nonlinear
              bifurcation analysis for the full nonlinear models is also performed.  These
              objectives are accomplished by combining some important topics and recent
              methodologies in high-speed machining, symbolic computation, and nonlinear
              dynamics into a single research thrust.  By incorporating time-delay into an
              existing symbolic algorithm for stability analysis of time-periodic systems,
              the stability boundaries (for example, in the two-parameter plane of spindle
              speed and depth of cut) which predict chatter in machining operations are
              obtained analytically.  This task constitutes the first phase of the work plan
              and represents a significant design tool since, given a value of one parameter
              (say spindle speed), the critical value of the other (cutting depth) is easily
              obtained.  Consequently, this approach provides an attractive alternative to
              designers who often try to operate in a narrow spindle speed range on the
              stability chart while retaining as high a cutting speed as possible. Since
              recent research on chatter instability in turning indicates that linear
              stability analysis alone is inadequate and should be accompanied by a full
              nonlinear analysis, the second phase of the work plan, namely the analytical
              bifurcation analysis for the time-periodic milling models, is accomplished by
              combining existing computational tools for time-periodic systems with the Hopf
              bifurcation algorithm for DDEs.  The results thus obtained allows the
              determination of the critical parameter set for loss of global stability and
              the domain of attraction just prior to loss of local stability.  Experimental
              validation of the theoretical results is made by collaborators at NIST.  This
              project fosters cross-disciplinary education in engineering and mathematics
              through training graduate students and bringing current research and practice
              (including symbolic computation) into undergraduate
              classrooms.
