Abstract    :
              0114126  Smets  The objective of this research project is to use an innovative
              protein engineering approach to create dioxygenases that initiate aerobic
              attack on trinitrotoluene (TNT) and aminodinitrotoluenes (ADNT), products of
              natural attenuation of TNT.  The approach will be to expand the substrate range
              of nitroarene dioxygenases to allow oxidative transformation of ADNT and/or
              TNT.  The gene encoding the large subunit of the terminal oxygenase will be the
              focus of this work.  DNA shuffling will be used to create variants of two
              2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) dioxygenases individually.  Burkholdria sp. strain DNT
              will be used as the initial host to create a complete pathway for TNT/ADNT
              degradation.  Creation of a complete, successful ADNT and/or TNT mineralization
              pathway will be initiated.  Hence, the enzymatic steps for the down-stream
              processing of expected transformation products will also be addressed.  Using a
              novel, directed-evolution approach and metabolic engineering, this project aims
              to create the first oxidative enzyme and pathway for the biomineralization of
              TNT/ADNT.  The constructed strain will be invaluable in developing sustainable
              strategies for remediation of explosives contaminated environments. ***
