Abstract    :
               The Wildlife Conservation Society/Bronx Zoo seeks NSF funding to develop an
              exciting  new three-year program designed to engage girls and young women in
              science. Operated with the  Girl Scouts of the USA, the National 4-H Council,
              the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Girls Inc.,  and the Children's Aid
              Society, the program will reach thousands of girls across the U.S. over the
               grant period and thousands more thereafter. The WCS is uniquely qualified to
              run this program,  having on its staff many women science professionals who
              are national and international leaders  in their fields, and having conducted
              a number of pioneering programs for young women in the  recent past. The
              36-month program will consist of:  - An Annual Earth Summit that will
              introduce 80 girls ages 14-17 to environmental science,  including key
              environmental issues in regions across the U.S., as well as to careers and
              women  role models in environmental science. (The girls will attend the Summit
              in teams of two or  three.)  -A series of service-learning projects through
              which the Earth Summit participants will be  strongly encouraged to apply what
              they have learned in a community-based project that  combines knowledge,
              service and reflection.  -A program of technical assistance, through which the
              participants will be provided with  ongoing assistance that will enable them
              to more effectively plan and implement their service-  learning projects; and
               - A ``Virtual Club House,'' through which the girls will be able to
              communicate with each other  and WCS staff about the program and environmental
              issues. The clubhouse will also showcase  projects that the Earth Summit
              participants will conduct and explain how other young people  might undertake
              similar community outreach and research projects.   The proposed program
              represents a unique means of increasing the participation of girls  and young
              women in science. It will capitalize on the enthusiasm young people have for
              animals,  nature, and for visiting informal science centers, such as the Bronx
              Zoo, to excite girls and young  women about science learning. The program will
              also seek to increase involvement through a  focus on ecology and
              environmental science, subjects that are of immediate relevance to students.
               With their world being increasingly altered by human activity, what happens
              to the environment  is of tremendous importance to the daily lives of girls
              and young women today and will become  even more so in the future. By focusing
              on content that is immediately relevant, we believe the  program will
              significantly increase participant involvement.   The program will build on a
              hugely successful Wildlife Science Careers Program that the  Wildlife
              Conservation Society has been undertaking over the past three years in
              conjunction with  the Girl Scout Council of Greater New York. This extremely
              popular program has involved 315  eighth- and ninth-grade Girl Scouts and
              trained many of them to introduce thousands of younger  Girl Scouts in New
              York City to career opportunities in science. The new program will allow the
               WCS to reach girls across the U.S., to involve girls in science projects that
              will be of benefit to local  communities, and to broaden the emphasis of the
              Wildlife Science Careers Program from science  careers to a more general focus
              on environmental science and local environmental issues.
