Abstract    :
              Plants respond to pathogen attack through a variety of signaling pathways
              consisting of regulatory as well as effector genes. These genes are known as
              defense-related genes. Many defense-related genes have been identified through
              genetic analysis conducted in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, how these genes
              function to switch on plant defense and to fend off infection is still largely
              unknown. The focus of this grant is to determine the functions of these
              defense-related genes. More specifically, genes that serve as "switches "of
              various plant defense responses will be put into the proper regulatory circuits
              and the effector genes that protect against different pathogens will be
              identified. Descriptions of the candidate genes chosen for this grant can be
              found at carnegiedpb.stanford.edu/shauna.html. The data generated by this
              project will be stored initially in the Harvard Medical School Expression
              Database (ExpressDB)and then transferred to the MGH plant-microbe interaction
              database (PMIDB)which will be constructed as part of this project. The data
              deposited in these databases will be made available to the public either at the
              time of publication or after a 3-month delay, whichever comes sooner. The
              information generated by this project will be very useful to all scientists
              studying various plant disease resistance mechanisms because Arabidopsis
              exhibits all of the major kinds of defense responses present in other plants.
              The results of this research are essential for achieving the goal of the NSF
              2010 project, which aims at elucidating the functions of all Arabidopsis genes
              by Year 2010. Pathogen resistance is a fundamental process in plants and a
              significant percentage of genes in Arabidopsis are defense-related genes.
              Understanding the function of these genes will lead to the development of new
              technologies in controlling crop diseases in agriculture and a reduction in the
              usage of hazardous pesticides.
