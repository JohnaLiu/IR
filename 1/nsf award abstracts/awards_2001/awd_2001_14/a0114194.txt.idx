Abstract    :
               The adrenal gland regulates essential physiological functions in the adult
              mammalian organism through producing gluco- and mineralocorticoids.
              Furthermore, through production of steroid hormones, the adrenal gland
              contributes to the normal maturation of fetal organ systems, including lung,
              liver, pancreas, brain, retina, and gastrointestinal tract. Several distinct
              signals have been implicated as critical for pre- and postnatal development and
              for maintenance of the mammalian adrenal gland. These include signals from the
              pituitary, such as pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides, and signals
              derived from the cells of the adrenal itself, such as corticosterone. It is
              essential to know more specifically which factors are required for which
              aspects of adrenal development and maintenance. The principal investigator
              recently developed a strain of genetically engineered mutant mice lacking all
              POMC-derived peptides. These POMC null mice develop non-functional adrenal
              structures that completely disappear in the adult, thus affording a new
              opportunity to study the role of POMC peptides in adrenal development,
              maintenance, and function. In this proposal the investigators will
              systematically exploit the POMC knockout mouse to probe the molecular
              mechanisms regulating mammalian adrenal development and maintenance. The first
              objective is to determine whether POMC-derived peptides, either supplied from
              the mother or from the fetus, are essential for the prenatal development of the
              adrenal structure. To this end the investigators will analyze prenatal adrenal
              development in embryos when either the mother or the fetus or both lack
              POMC-derived peptides. The second objective is to determine whether
              POMC-derived peptides are essential for postnatal adrenal development and
              differentiation.  The investigators will analyze postnatal adrenal development
              in pups lacking POMC-derived peptides, in POMC null mutant pups, which are
              pharmacologically reconstituted with individual or combinations of POMC
              peptides, and by postnatal transplantation of adrenals from wildtype and mutant
              donors to recipients having or lacking POMC peptides. The third objective is to
              assess the role of POMC-derived peptides in maintaining adult adrenal structure
              and function. The investigators will assess the maintenance of adrenal glands
              in mice lacking POMC peptides by transplanting normal adrenal tissue into POMC
              null mutant mice and reconstituting these mice with individual POMC peptides,
              and by subtraction of individual POMC peptides in POMC null mutants which have
              developed adrenals through postnatal reconstitution with POMC peptides.  This
              genetic dissection of the role of POMC peptides in pre-and postnatal adrenal
              development and maintenance will provide a detailed and necessary framework for
              the study of the molecular mechanisms generating and maintaining this important
              organ.
