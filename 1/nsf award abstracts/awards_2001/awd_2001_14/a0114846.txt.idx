Abstract    :
              This proposal will  continue the investigation of a non-thermal annealing
              process. The process involves focusing a high energy laser pulse to a small (~2
              mm) spot on the surface of a sample.  It has been found that such a laser pulse
              will anneal areas of approximately 1cm 2 in ion-implanted silicon. It has been
              shown that the annealing occurs without the introduction of heat, and is
              therefore different that conventional thermal processes. The process has
              demonstrated 100% reproducibility on silicon that has been ion-implanted with
              boron, phosphorus, and arsenic. The effectiveness of the process has been
              demonstrated at implant energies as low as 1keV for boron. The current project
              would investigate methods for increasing the annealed area, and apply the
              process to different materials. Increasing the area will be accomplished by
              trying different laser focusing schemes. These involve using cylindrical lenses
              instead of spherical lenses, varying the laser spot size, and angle of
              incidence, and using other methods of launching shock waves in the material.
              Different material systems to be investigated include patterned silicon wafers,
              simple electrical structures, such as diodes, GaAs, GaN, and high-k dielectric
              materials. After processing, the effectiveness of the process will be
              determined using infrared absorption spectroscopy, secondary ion mass
              spectrometry, spreading resistance profiling, transmission electron microscopy,
              and sheet resistivity measurements. Completion of the project will increase
              knowledge of materials processing, and may provide a valuable processing step
              for the semiconductor industry. The project will also serve an educational
              purpose, employing both graduate and undergraduate students, who can then
              pursue careers in science and engineering.
