Abstract    :
              Observations of the auroral ionosphere have shown the presence of very strong,
              highly localized gradients in the ionospheric density.  These gradients appear
              to be related to localized electric fields.  This project will examine the
              features of localized electrostatic fields, and the plasma waves and density
              fluctuations related to such fields.  The project will also examine the
              interaction of ions with the localized electric fields.  The research will
              quantify the ion interaction with the fields and determine the resulting
              theoretical ion distribution functions, which may then be compared with direct
              measurements.
