Abstract    :
              0114262  Tyburczy   This grant provides three years partial salary support
              for a technician to supervise the Multiple Anvil High Pressure Laboratory at
              Arizona State University (ASU).  This laboratory currently consists of three
              Walker-type multiple anvil devices plus sample preparation stations and
              ancillary support equipment in a 2500 square foot space.  The Laboratory
              Supervisor will maintain and improve the high pressure equipment, supervise
              laboratory usage by ASU researchers and visitors, and aid ASU researchers in
              development of novel experimental approaches.  A Lab Supervisor is essential to
              proper functioning of the lab in light of the great number of earth scientists
              and students working in the lab and the varied nature of their of their
              projects.  The current Laboratory Supervisor, Dr. Kurt D. Leinenweber, is a
              respected and significant member of the Earth Science high pressure and
              crystallographic communities as well as a superb supervisor, innovator and
              teacher of high pressure technology. He has been Laboratory Supervisor for this
              facility for the past 6 years.  This support will facilitate important new
              research on high pressure synthesis and phase equilibria of earth materials,
              including novel work on hydrous high pressure phases, and measurements of
              physical properties of earth materials at high pressures, including rheological
              and electrical properties.  In addition to Earth Science utilization, this
              facility will be used by chemists, materials scientists, and physicists from
              ASU and other institutions for synthesis and characterization of novel
              materials.    ***
