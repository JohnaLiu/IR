Abstract    :
              This project will attempt to develop and extend a new framework for the modeling
              and compensation of reactive (inactive) power in electric power grids. Reactive
              power is essentially the result of difficulties in aligning the phases of
              electricity in AC power flows; in thc worst case, when a small power supply is
              connected to the grid with incorrect phase relations and timing, it may
              actua]ly take power away from the grid rather than add to the grid, even though
              it is burning fuel and generating electricity. Difficulties in managing such
              phase relatiotis are a major harrier to the greater, more efficient use of
              distributed generation and renewable energy sources.  By developing a new way
              to represent and manage such phase relations, ibis proposal hopes to provide a
              stream of benefits, both short-term and long-term, to the electric power
              community. The most immediate applications would be in power systems (for
              evaluation of loads and metering) industrial electric drives (for design of
              filters and control of converters) and power electronic systems (for modeling
              and control of active filters and uninterruptible power supplies.) Automotive,
              naval and aerospace applications are also envisioned.
