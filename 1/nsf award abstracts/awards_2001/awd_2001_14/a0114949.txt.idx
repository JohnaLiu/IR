Abstract    :
              The  goal of the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools (WS/FCS) proposal entitled
              Science and Mathematics Excellence (SciMaX) is that all students will graduate
              with the capacity to pursue post-secondary studies and careers in science and
              mathematics.  Its specific objectives are (1) To complete the implementation of
              standards-based K-12 mathematics and science program within the District
              establishing high standards for all students in all classrooms; (2) To increase
              K-8 proficiency by 4% in End-of-Grade [test] in mathematics, by 5% in 8th grade
              Algebra I, and by 5 percentile points in science each year; (3) To increase
              enrollment in upper level mathematics and science courses by 10% each year and
              achieve an overall completion of 80%; and (4) To partner with universities to
              ensure that new teachers arrive in the school system with the training needed
              to teach high-quality, standards-based science and mathematics
              curriculum.  WS/FCS plans revision and compacting of the K-8 mathematics
              curriculum to ensure that all pre-algebra topics are addressed by the end of
              the 7th grade, which will facilitate successful student performance in algebra
              at the 8th grade.  Similarly, the District has created a plan to infuse science
              standards-based, hands-on instruction at all grade levels through the
              implementation of reform instructional materials and to integrate this subject
              to mathematics and the Language Arts.  A student safety-net program will be
              implemented consisting of bridge courses and pre-college programs.  In order to
              ensure the coherent accomplishment of its objectives, WS/FCS will organize
              Vertical Leadership Teams (VLT) consisting of a cross section of represented
              schools, including school principals, counselors, curriculum coordinators,
              teachers, students, parents, business and post-secondary partners based on a
              three-cohort model.    A comprehensive evaluation plan will enable the
              leadership to assess progress in every component of the Initiative; and gather,
              interpret and use data to inform the planning and decision-making
              process.
