Abstract    :
              	The researchers in this project will conduct three field seasons in Egypt with
              subsequent studies on recovered fossils to be carried out at Duke and
              cooperating laboratories.  The objective is to learn more about the earliest
              forerunners of monkeys, apes and humans.  Previous discoveries have made this
              the world's most important location for such research.  During the projected
              seasons, sites in the Fayum region will yield skulls, jaws, and skeletal parts
              from many early primates of both Eocene and Oligocene age.  These date between
              about 36 and 26 million years old.  Fossils come from a dozen quarries and are
              seldom recovered as associated skeletons, so that great diligence over long
              periods of time is required to add knowledge by finding previously unknown and
              often unassociated limb bones and skulls of the more than twenty extinct
              primate species that occur there.  Most of these are represented only  by parts
              of upper and lower jaws and, hence, much remains to be discovered.  Africa
              appears to be the continent where the group of monkeys, apes and humans
              experienced most of its history and the Fayum holds the only continuous
              sequence of deposits in Africa during the early part of the time concerned.
