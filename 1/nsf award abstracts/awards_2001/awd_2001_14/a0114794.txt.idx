Abstract    :
              The San Antonio Urban Systemic Program  ABSTRACT  The San Antonio Urban
              Systemic Program (SAUSP) plans to promote full implementation of K-12
              standards-based, inquiry-centered curricula in a coalition of nine school
              districts through the organization of elementary, middle, and high schools in
              K-12 school-feeder patterns served by teams of coaches.  In order to increase
              the competency of the instructional workforce to accomplish this goal, San
              Antonio plans to implement a comprehensive professional development program in
              close collaboration with local institutions of higher education.  A Citywide
              Monitoring System will provide for evaluation of student understanding of
              mathematics and science.  This system will include a set of performance tasks
              to evaluate instructional practices and curriculum implementation, a web-based
              curriculum network to support excellence in instruction providing high-quality
              assessments and examples of standards-based instruction, and the use of
              district-based equity teams to specifically address the achievement gaps
              between ethnic and socioeconomic groups.    Consistent with this end,
              participating districts have proposed the development of a new assessment
              system that is fully congruent and supportive of effective implementation of
              standards-based curricula.  Furthermore, in order to secure a permanent
              coordination of a community coalition comprised of K-12 educators, business and
              community members, and the university sector, the SAUSP will establish a K-16
              Implementation Team.    A comprehensive evaluation plan will enable the
              leadership to assess progress in every component of the Initiative; gather,
              interpret and use data to inform the planning and decision-making process.
