Abstract    :
              0114009 Gibson-Carpenter, Alexander 	Ecotourism purports to protect fragile
              ecosystems while delivering economic development to host communities and
              recreation to tourists.  This project studies the impact of ecotourism on the
              livelihoods of host community households. Using a research method known as
              tourism impact assessment, the two anthropologists, their students and
              colleagues in Costa Rica and Belize will measure "household livelihood security
              and vulnerability" using an inclusive set of proxy indicators of social,
              economic, and environmental well-being. The hypothesis to be tested is that
              household participation in ecotourism improves household livelihood security
              and reduces vulnerability.  Eight sites (four in each of the two countries)
              will be studied, half of the sites engaged in ecotourism and half not, in both
              the high- and low-tourism seasons.  Qualitative data will be gathered using
              participant observation, key informant interviews, household surveys, and
              general ethnography; quantitative anthropometric measures of health will be
              recorded for small children; household economic indices will be measured; and
              available statistics on tourism and economic development will be collected and
              analyzed. The resulting study will advance our understanding of the impact of
              tourism, one of the world's major industries, upon rural communities in the
              developing world.  This new knowledge will be valuable to planners, local
              officials, and community members.
