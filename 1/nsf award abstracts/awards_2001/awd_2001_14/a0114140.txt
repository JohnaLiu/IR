Abstract    :
              
This research focus is on the investigation of a variety of process control
              schemes for regulating and improving highly reliable systems such as those
              found in the high volume electronics assembly environment.  When the entire
              manufacturing process is considered, there are a large number of operations
              that must be performed properly in order to manufacture high quality
              electronics modules.  The Center for Advanced Vehicle Electronics (CAVE) at
              Auburn University recently undertook an extensive effort to evaluate the entire
              solder paste process for the electronics manufacturing environment, and this
              effort complements that research in the area of electronics placement and
              visual inspection of the component devices.
