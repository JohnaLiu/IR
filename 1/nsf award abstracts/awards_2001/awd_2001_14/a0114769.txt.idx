Abstract    :
              Abstract   Protein phosphorylation is a major mode of regulation of
              metabolism, gene expression, and cellular architecture in eukaryotic cells, and
              defining phosphorylation-based regulatory networks is essential for
              understanding the function of the Arabidopsis genome. The goal of this project
              is to define phosphorylation networks that are related to the function of
              calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) and four closely related families;
              CDPK-related kinases (CRKs), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinases (PPCKs),
              PPCK-related kinases (PEPRKs), and SNF-1 related kinases (SnRKs). These 88
              kinases, which represent about 9% of all the protein kinases in the Arabidopsis
              genome, are involved in all aspects of plant development and physiology and
              participate in the coupling of cellular responses to environmental and
              developmental signals. A list of these protein kinases including gene
              identification numbers is available at http://www.arabidopsis.org, and further
              information including links to database records is available at
              http://plantsp.sdsc.edu. This research will investigate the function of 64
              members of these families through determination of the subcellular location of
              each kinase and identification of downstream targets and other proteins with
              which the kinases associate. This information will give insight into the
              physiological roles of each kinase by identifying signaling networks in which
              each participates. This research will also determine the target sequences in
              substrate proteins that are phosphorylated by each kinase, and these results
              will contribute to understanding the overlap in kinase function and cross-talk
              between signaling pathways. The results of this work will be made available on
              a yearly basis at the two URLs given above.
