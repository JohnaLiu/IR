Abstract    :
              This program will introduce and analyze a new rapid manufacturing technology for
              fabrication of functional miniature devices with integrated intelligent
              structures and encapsulated components. This will be based on the ultrasonic
              welding (USW) process, a solid-state, cold joining technique, yielding strong
              bonding between dissimilar metals and other materials. Ultrasonic rapid
              manufacturing (URM) will utilize multiple material foils and fibers, that will
              be bonded in subsequent layers, followed by ultrasonically assisted diamond
              scribing to the proper contours. Fundamental understanding and comprehensive
              modeling of microscale USW, will be addressed by a hybrid experimental and
              computational process analysis. Extensive characterization of the joint
              structure and properties of aluminum bonds to other selected metal alloys will
              be performed in the laboratory. Knowledge gained from this research will define
              optimal process conditions, allow intensive study of microscale material
              effects, making it accessible through incorporation in a continuous ultrasonic
              transformation database. Numerical simulation of the interdependent mechanical,
              thermal and diffusion distributions during the USW process will be conducted in
              concert with the experimental work. Researchers at Tufts University and
              Northeastern University will collaborate on this project.  This URM research
              will be connected with the engineering curriculum to leverage rapid
              manufacturing education. This will be promoted by a new undergraduate/graduate
              course on Rapid Prototyping, Tooling and Manufacturing, as a basis for a future
              Rapid Manufacturing minor; a new SFF and Microfabrication Seminar series with
              invited industry experts; and an annual Rapid Manufacturing Contest for
              undergraduate student groups nationwide. The program will involve close
              collaboration of the partnering institutions. Industrial sponsorship through
              in-kind equipment and technical support will also be provided by Axcelis
              Technologies, Honda R&D Americas and Stapla Ultrasonics. The benefits of the
              new technology will be harnessed in the design and fabrication of miniature
              multi-material internal structures, with embedded prefabricated elements
              (sensors, actuators, processors, MEMS etc), providing multi-domain
              functionality in mechatronic, optoelectronic, microfluidic, biomedical
              microdevices etc.
