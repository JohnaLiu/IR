This Americas Program award will support Dr. Oscar D.
              Crisalle of the University of Florida in collaboration with Dr. Jose M. Pinto
              of the University of Sao Paulo, for the organization of the 2nd Pan American
              Workshop on Process Systems Engineering to be held in Guaruja, Sao Paulo,
              Brazil on September 20-21, 2001.  This project will focus on two specific areas
              of process systems engineering: (1) Process Control and (2) Process Planning
              and Optimization.  The major goal of the workshop is to identify common
              research priorities, and to explore possible areas of joint research
              cooperation in process engineering research that can lead to significant
              scientific and economic benefits for the participating countries.  

Several
              benefits will be derived from this workshop, including (1) the development of
              new collaborations in the area of process control, (2) expanding the number of
              collaborations in the area of process planning and optimization beyond that
              achieved through a previous workshop, (3) increasing the number of exchanges of
              students and faculty between the US and South America, and (4) the publication
              of several articles in a special issue of computers in Chemical Engineering
              dedicated to covering the workshop.
