Abstract    :
              A different algebraic equation (DAE) is an implicit differential equation
              relating various quantities, their rates of changes, and control and source
              terms.  DAEs are the natural way in which to describe many industrial and
              scientific processes.  A DAE formulation often provides the quicker model
              development and more accurate modeling than when using explicit equations. 
              However, using the DAE formulation on complex problems poses a number of
              technical challenges.  Recently, it has been shown that a number of fundamental
              problems in control and systems theory including observer design, model
              identification, and failure detection can be naturally viewed as problems
              involving DAEs.  In the past this has mainly been examined for lower
              dimensional linear systems.  It is proposed to examine these problems for large
              complex nonlinear systems.  In particular, systems with delays and mixed
              discrete continuous dynamics will be examined.  Both theory and practical,
              robust, numerical algorithms will be developed.  Particular questions to be
              examined include model identification, failure detection, observer design,
              system simulation, and fault isolation.  The results will be applied to
              applications from the aerospace, chemical processing, and other industries.
