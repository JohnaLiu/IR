Abstract    :
              0114478 Barazangi  Description:  This award supports a joint workshop and
              cooperative research project on the Tectonics of Eastern Turkey.  The workshop
              will be held in Istanbul, Turkey, in May 2002.  The co-organizers are Dr.
              Muawia Barazangi, Department of Geological Sciences, Cornell University,
              Ithaca, New York and Dr. Niyazi Turkelli, Professor of Geophysics at the
              Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute (KOERI), Bogazici
              University, Istanbul.  The workshop will focus on the evolution and origin of
              the Eastern Anatolian Plateau, Bitlis suture, and East Anatolian Fault Zone
              (EAFZ).  Scientists from Cornell and the KOERI have recently deployed a
              temporary NSF-funded PASSCAL array in eastern Turkey.  The array is designed to
              improve understanding of the Bitlis/Zagros thrust zones as well as the nature
              of continental escape along the EAFZ and North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ),
              imaging upper mantle and crustal structure in these two fairly different
              tectonic environments.  In order to interpret these seismic images, it is
              necessary to incorporate geochemical, geomorphic, and geologic observations
              from the region. Ten US scientists and at least six Turkish scientists are
              expected to participate.  KOERI seismologists will make several trips to
              Cornell for close collaboration on the analysis of data collected from a recent
              broadband array in eastern Turkey.    Scope:  This award will encourage
              discussion among US and Turkish scientists on several important geological
              questions in light of data already collected.  These questions include:  Is the
              Arabian plate being subducted, delaminated, or neither?  Is the Anatolian
              plateau supported dynamically or isostatically?  What are the current
              earthquake hazards in eastern Turkey?  Appropriate Turkish government officials
              will be invited to a special session on the implications of the results
              concerning the evaluation of earthquake hazard in eastern Turkey.  Funding for
              this project is provided by the Division of International Programs and the
              Division of Earth Sciences.
