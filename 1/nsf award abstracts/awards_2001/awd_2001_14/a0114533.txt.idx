Abstract    :
              Visual masking occurs when the visibility of one stimulus, called the target, is
              reduced by the presence of another stimulus, designated as the mask.  Like the
              techniques of binocular rivalry and of multi-stable percepts of the same
              stimulus, visual masking provides a way to dissociate neural processes that are
              merely stimulus-dependent but not correlated with conscious perception, from
              neural processes that are percept-dependent and thus correlated with conscious
              perception of the stimulus.  The broad long-term objective of this research is
              to use the visual masking paradigm to study the temporal dynamics in the
              micro-genesis of pattern processing from the time of stimulus presentation to
              the time of its full registration in consciousness.  A modified dual-channel
              model of visual masking that incorporates mutual inhibitory interactions
              between sustained parvocellular (P) and transient magnocellular (M) pathways
              will be used to study how the cortical response evoked by the mask interacts
              with the early and late components of the cortical response evoked by the
              target.  The project will rely on the masking paradigms of para- and
              metacontrast, theoretical tools based on neural-network modeling, and the
              additional psychophysical techniques of target disinhibition, binocular
              rivalry, and unconscious priming by a masked (perceptually suppressed) target. 
              It will investigate where and when in the stream of processing the mechanisms
              implicated in suppression and disinhibition of target visibility are located. 
              It will also probe whether and when the mechanisms implicated in suppression
              and disinhibition of target visibility relate to stimulus-dependent
              (unconscious) or percept-dependent (conscious) levels of neural processing. 
              The research is expected to provide a better understanding of the perceptual
              processes leading to conscious registration of stimuli.  The potential
              applications include the development of novel biomimetic engineering design
              principles for autonomous perceptual devices and the development of clinical
              diagnostic or vulnerability markers for disorders such as dyslexia and
              schizophrenia.
