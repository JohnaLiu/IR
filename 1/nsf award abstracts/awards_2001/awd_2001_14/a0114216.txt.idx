Abstract    :
              X-ray detection is often the limiting factor in modern synchrotron-based
              fluorescence experiments in material science and biophysics. The brightness
              available from synchrotron radiation sources has increased by nearly 10 orders
              of magnitude in the past 20 years, but our ability to collect and discriminate
              emitted x-rays has not kept pace. This award from the Instrumentation for
              Materials Research program to the University of California Davis will support
              new detector development which will greatly enhance the sensitivity of existing
              instrumentation for fluorescence analysis of thin films or dilute samples in
              material science and biophysics. This instrument development will adapt
              existing cryogenic detectors to the specific needs of synchrotron experiments.
              The origin of the spectral artifacts that presently limit the sensitivity to
              certain emission lines will be studied and addressed. The current detector's
              usable energy range will be extended beyond one kilo electronvolt by adding
              thick absorber films of high Z materials. The total area and count rate
              capabilities of the sensor will be increased by increasing This development
              will be done by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in collaboration
              with the Advanced Detector Group at Lawrence Livermore. The cryogenic
              spectrometer will be available to collaborators on a proposal basis. Combining
              such high-sensitivity high-resolution detectors with the intensity of undulator
              radiation of third generation synchrotrons will open up a range of new
              experimental methods for previously unfeasible science. Graduate students will
              focus on two sets of experiments. They will develop angle-resolved soft x-ray
              fluorescence spectroscopy for non-destructive depth profiling of thin film
              samples. They will also extend fluorescence-detected L-edge absorption
              spectroscopy to vanadium and manganese-containing metalloenzymes to determine
              the chemical oxidation state of the metal site during the catalytic cycle. The
              long-term goal is to combine non-destructive depth profiling and in-situ
              chemical characterization of samples with part per million level
              sensitivity.  X-ray detection is often the limiting factor in modern
              synchrotron-based fluorescence experiments in material science and biophysics.
              The brightness available from synchrotron radiation sources has increased by
              nearly 10 orders of magnitude in the past 20 years, but our ability to collect
              and discriminate emitted x-rays has not kept pace. This award from the
              Instrumentation for Materials Research program to the University of California
              Davis will support new detector development which will greatly enhance the
              sensitivity of existing instrumentation for fluorescence analysis of thin films
              or dilute samples in material science and biophysics. This instrument
              development will adapt existing cryogenic detectors to the specific needs of
              synchrotron experiments. The development will be done by graduate students and
