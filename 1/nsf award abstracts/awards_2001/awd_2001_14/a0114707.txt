Abstract    :
              Prediction of protein structure based on sequence information is of great value
              for the interpretation of genomic sequence data.  Such method would reduce the
              number of protein structure that must be determined experimentally to obtain a
              structural complement for an organism.  The new method integrates tools such as
              secondary structure prediction and distance-based torsion angle dynamics with
              the idea of patch-based tertiary contact prediction and bootstrapping.  The
              first class of proteins will be those that take on an alpha-helical structure,
              the class of proteins for which prediction has been most successful.  The
              method will be extended to predict arrangements of transmembrane helices.  A
              further extension to the structure of beta-sheet proteins will involve motif
              detection and accumulation of motifs into larger structures. The methods will
              be optimized and scored to aid in selecting the best model structure. The
              result will be automated high accuracy software that can be used on whole
              genome sequences.
