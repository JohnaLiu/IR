Abstract    :
              The investigators will purchase an advanced high-speed camera to make sixteen
              frame movies of single plasma "shots".  The main objective is to be able to
              follow magnetic reconnection and the propagation of ripples of magnetic twist
              (such as Alfven waves) away from regions of reconnection. The framing rate will
              be between 8 million and 200 million frames per second. Shot-to-shot
              reproducibility will no longer be a constraint because the entire fine
              structure evolution will be captured in a single shot. Data throughput will be
              increased 16-fold enabling many more experiments and investigation of many
              important phenomena not being pursued at present. Simulated solar prominences
              in the laboratory have recently been demonstrated using a unique, specially
              designed experimental facility at Caltech. The facility uses pulsed power
              plasma technology to produce a short-lived plasma (10 microseconds) with large
              magnetic fields (several kilogauss), high currents (tens of kiloamps), and
              modest dimensions (tens of centimeters). This plasma has the morphology and
              dynamics of a solar prominence. A program is underway to investigate the
              topological evolution of these simulated prominences. Topological evolution
              involves the breaking and reconnection of magnetic field lines and is believed
              to be a critical process in solar prominence eruptions. The present method for
              diagnosing the solar prominence simulation experiments uses a single-frame
              high-speed digital camera, that is a camera that takes a single photograph at a
              time. The technique consists of creating a sequence of identical plasma shots
              and then making a single ten nanosecond photo of each shot, but with increasing
              time offsets of a few hundred nanoseconds. The shot-to-shot reproducibility is
              sufficient to follow the gross variation in morphology, but not the details.
              Because it takes about 2 minutes to recharge the pulse power capacitor banks
              between plasma shots, this single-shot accumulation technique is both tedious
              and time consuming.
