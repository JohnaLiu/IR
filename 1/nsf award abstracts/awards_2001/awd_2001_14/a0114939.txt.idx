Abstract    :
               The goal of this research project is to provide an economic analysis of the
              political ramifications of the decline in marriage. Arguably, the most
              significant development in the recent history of the family is the decline in
              marriage, and the rise in the proportion of single individuals in most Western
              countries. In the US, between 1964 and 1996, the proportion of currently
              married individuals fell by a quarter (from 84 to 58 percent) while the
              fraction currently divorced increased threefold (from 3 to 10 percent). In so
              far as marriage is one of the most important institutions for resource
              redistribution between individuals, and redistributive preferences are central
              to many political choices it is relevant to examine how the decline in marriage
              has affected political outcomes.         Our research develops a theoretical
              model which demonstrates that under reasonable assumptions on the underlying
              income distributions, marriage patterns and income-sharing within households,
              changes in the extent of marriage alter the income distribution and thereby
              political outcomes. We use the model to identify how increased non-marriage
              affects (i) the divergence of male and female political preferences, the so
              called  gender gap; (ii) the aggregate demand for redistribution; (iii) the
              demographic and economic profile of swing voters; and  (iv) the divergence in
              preferences between married and not married voters,  the so called marriage
              gap. A key assumption underlying our analysis is that in general women marry
              men who are richer then themselves. Hence, relative to being single, marriage
              makes men poorer and women richer. This suggests that the decline in  marriage
              could explain the political gender gap. The change in the overall demand for
              redistribution is less clear since for each woman who turns left, a man turns
              right. We show that if non-marriage is first prevalent amongst  poor
              individuals, and then ``creeps up'' the income distribution, then initially
              non-marriage reduces the support for redistribution as male erstwhile
              left-leaning voters shift to supporting the right (cf. Reagan Democrats). As
              non-marriage increases amongst relatively well off groups, women in this group
              will start to vote at variance with their socio-economic profile (cf. Soccer
              moms). This finding is consistent with the marriage gap, i.e. that, relative to
              unmarried individuals, married individuals  support the right to a greater
              extent.   We use US data to test our hypotheses. First, using longitudinal
              data from the  Youth-Parent Socialization survey (1973 and 1982 waves) we
              investigate whether realized changes in an individual's marital status affect
              his/her political preferences in the hypothesized direction. Second, we examine
              how changes in a US state's ``marriage market'' over the period 1964-96 have
              affected male and female  political preferences. We measure changes in the
              state marriage market in two ways: first, by the stock of currently divorced
              individuals in a state (computed from the annual Current Population Survey);
              and second, by state divorce law changes. Our information about individual
              political preferences in from the  National Election Survey studies
              (1964-96).
