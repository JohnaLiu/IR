Jean Hertzberg, University of Colorado

In this proposal, funding
              is requested to purchase a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system to enhance
              the research capabilities of the PI and four Co-PI's.  They are actively 
              engaged in a number of interesting research problems in fluid mechanics.  These
              include real time simulation and control of a two-dimensional jet, evaluation
              of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) fluidic devices, cardiovascular
              fluid dynamics, and infectious aerosol generation.
