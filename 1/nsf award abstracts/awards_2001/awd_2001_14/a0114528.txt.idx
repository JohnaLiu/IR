Abstract    :
              0114528 Rao This award supports Vittal Rao of University of Missouri-Rolla and
              junior and senior researchers from various U.S. universities to participate in
              workshops on engineering education.  The workshops will be held concomitantly
              with the International Conference on Engineering Education to be held in Oslo,
              Norway, August 6-10, 2001. The workshop topics are internet-based course
              development, exchange programs for students and faculty, multidisciplinary
              design programs, and industry collaborations and alliances.  The selection
              process for which participants will be supported will be open, and a special
              effort will be made to include junior faculty members.  Special attention will
              be given to strengthening ties between delegates from the U.S. and those from
              the various other countries.  A primary goal of the workshops is to catalyze
              the development of action plans for long-term international collaborations and
              partnerships, and to promote sharing of educational innovations between the
              schools of different countries.
