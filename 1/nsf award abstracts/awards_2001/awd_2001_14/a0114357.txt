Abstract    :
              The project is a pilot study of the Tjornes fracture zone offshore northern
              Iceland with the goal of demonstrating the feasibility of mapping Holocene
              faulting and volcanic activity in the tectonically complex fracture zone
              system.  The project will use a SUBSCAN chirp sonar system and a
              high-resolution multicchannel seismic acquisition system, together with
              conventional bathymetric mapping.  Specific objectives are to determine the
              current location and history of strike-slip movement along the offshore portion
              of the fracture system, to estimate the amount of extension of the
              Eyjafjardarall graben over the past 1-2 Ma, and to examine how the north-south
              graben structures terminate near the fracture zone.  If successful, a joint
              Iceland-US investigation of the Tjornes fracture zone and other portions of
              Iceland's insular shelf are planned.  The overaching goal of this research is
              to define strain partitioning in the Tjornes fracture zone in order to
              reconstruct the onshore-offshore deformation history of the region.
