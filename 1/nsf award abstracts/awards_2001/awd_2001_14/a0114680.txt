Abstract    :
              Girls Incorporated seeks a planning grant of $30,000 from the National Science
              Foundation's
Program in Gender Equity to develop a plan and proposal to
              reengineer our Operation
SMART program. With the proposed grant, Girls Inc.
              will compile and assess the research, 
technology, and our own experience
              relative to girls and science, math, engineering, and 
technology. We will
              then convene a meeting of experts to discuss this body of knowledge
and help
              map out are engineered program design and demonstration plan for
              Operation
SMART. This will enable us to provide an informed, relevant,
              accessible, and exciting 
new program to capture and retain the interest of a
              new generation of girls in the areas
of science, math, engineering, and
              technology.
