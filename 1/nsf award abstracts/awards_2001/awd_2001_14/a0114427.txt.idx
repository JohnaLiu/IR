Abstract    :
              The biosphere is usually thought of as plants and animals near the Earth's
              surface, but the Earth's habitable zone extends to depths of hundreds or
              thousands of meters. The Earth's subsurface biosphere is composed mostly of
              bacteria, and collectively these bacteria may have a mass equivalent to that of
              all life in the near-surface biosphere.  The emerging study of the subsurface
              biosphere could solve major environmental, agricultural, and industrial
              problems, and lead to products that will improve human health and prosperity. 
              The key to success in this field will be an understanding of the links between
              subsurface microbiology and the Earth's physical and chemical environments and
              processes.  This understanding is applicable to the transformation of toxic
              waste into harmless byproducts, safer drinking water, increased mining
              efficiency, increased flow of oil from wells, confining nuclear waste in
              storage facilities, improving soil and crops, reutilization of animal and human
              wastes, and the basics the Earth's global and local chemical cycles. To prepare
              graduate students for these challenges we will coordinate the training of
              students by internationally recognized engineers, microbiologists, geologists,
              oceanographers, geochemists, soil scientists, and hydrologists.  Students'
              preparation will be broadened with a new subsurface biosphere integrated minor
              with five related components. Some of these are: a group training effort,
              courses that link microbial with physical and chemical processes from molecular
              to global scales, and international and national internships, field programs,
              and symposia.  Ethical and cultural issues related to subsurface science,
              bioengineering, and the environment will be included in courses, seminars and
              workshops.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of
              educating Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the multidisciplinary backgrounds
              and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career
              demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in
              graduate education by establishing new, innovative models for graduate
              education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that
              transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. In the fourth year of the
              program, awards are being made to twenty-two institutions for programs that
              collectively span all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF. The
              intellectual foci of this specific award reside in the Directorates for
              Geosciences; Biological Sciences; Engineering; Education and Human Resources;
              and the Office of Polar Programs.
