Abstract    :
              This proposal will create a computerized bibliography of early printing in Latin
              America.    The Center for  Bibliographical Studies at the University of
              California, Riverside, will create the file in cooperation with major Latin
              American libraries, in particular the National Library of Mexico.    This file
              will be of assistance to scholars in literature, printing, and languages.  
              Experiments will investigate the means of assuring quality control,
              searchability, and other new computer techniques for dealing with such
              catalog files.
