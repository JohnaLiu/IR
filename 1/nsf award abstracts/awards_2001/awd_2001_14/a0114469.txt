Abstract    :
              In this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) supported by the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Gary A. Strobel of the Department
              of Plant Sciences at Montana State University, will trap, isolate and
              characterize the volatile substances produced by Muscodor alba, a new fungal
              genus and species isolated from the Honoduran rainforest.  It has been
              demonstrated that at least one of the gaseous compounds produced by M. alba is
              lethal to virtually all other endophytic fungi and bacteria that are present in
              the stem tissues of its plant host.  The separation and identification of the
              volatile components possessing antimicrobial activity will be pursued.

With
              the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Gary
              A. Strobel, of the Department of Plant Sciencs at Montana State University,
              will isolate and identify volatile organic compounds produced by a new fungal
              species, M. alba.  This mixture of gaseous substances has been shown to be
              lethal to a range of other fungi and bacteria.  Isolation of the bioactive
              product(s) may result in the identification of compounds with potential
              pharmaceutical applications, including antimicrobial agents.
