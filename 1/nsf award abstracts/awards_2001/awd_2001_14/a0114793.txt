Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project investigates the use of immigrant labor in
              the information technology industry, an industry that is recruiting foreign
              temporary workers in increasingly large numbers. Ethnographic research using
              interviews, participant-observation, and archival techniques will be conducted
              over the course of 12 months in Dublin, Ireland, the largest software-exporting
              region in the world. The main objective is to construct a model of how rapid
              technological change, the employment policies of IT firms and the career
              related attitudes of IT professionals are contributing to an intensification of
              labor migration in the industry. This investigation will offer significant new
              insights into processes within the IT industry that create the supply of and
              demand for immigrant workers. This knowledge can be used to inform decision
              making about future policies for managing the immigration of IT professionals.
              In addition, by documenting the ways that careers in the IT industry are
              changing as the pace of technological change quickens and firms reorganize
              around more flexible forms of production, the knowledge gained from this
              project can assist policymakers in evaluating future prospects for careers in
              an industry that will provide many of the jobs of the 21St century.
