Abstract    :
              The objective of this Power Systems Engineering Research Center (PSERC) project
              is to develop a database of information for use by utilities and electricity
              end-users in evaluating distributed generation (DG) and distributed energy
              storage (DES).  The information in the database can be used with utility,
              end-user, and investor economic evaluation methods to compare the various DG
              and DES technologies with central station generation and transmission and
              distribution improvement options.
