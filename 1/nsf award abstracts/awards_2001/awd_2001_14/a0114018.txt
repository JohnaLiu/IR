Abstract    :
              This project establishes a scholarship program for master's students in the
              science and practice of information assurance. Selected students perform two
              years of federal service in the information assurance field upon graduation.
              Through courses, involving extensive laboratory exercises and projects,
              students learn first hand how to design, build, configure and manage systems
              and network security. Student complete thesis projects which permit them to
              explore a particular topic in depth and engage in research. The project
              addresses the current personnel gap in information assurance for the federal
              information infrastructure and enhances the program and capacity within the
              institution for further development.
