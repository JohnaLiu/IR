The objective of this research is to extract information about
              the structure and function of the lung from noninvasive acoustic measurements. 
              The specific aims of this research are: (1) to measure sound waves produced
              during airway opening (crackle sound) and the lung pressure-volume (P-V) curve
              in normal and surfactant depleted lungs from several species with distinctly
              different airway geometry, (2) to analyze the airway structure from the crackle
              sound and the P-V curve and compare it to available morphometric data, and (3)
              to use airway tree models to predict the relationships between lung mechanics,
              lung function including Computed Tomography images, and the mechanism of lung
              injury during mechanical ventilation.
