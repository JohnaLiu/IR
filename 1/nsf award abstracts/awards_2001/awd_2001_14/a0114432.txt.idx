Abstract    :
              Unprecedented and accelerating rates of biological invasion are creating a
              unique set of environmental, economic, and social challenges.  Modern
              agricultural societies would not exist were it not for human-mediated
              introductions of crops and livestock.  Yet, as a result of the globalization of
              human commerce and travel, invasions are rapidly and profoundly changing the
              environment.  The effects of invasions are felt at all biological scales, from
              genes to ecosystems, with enormous ecological and economic consequences.  From
              every perspective, biological invasions epitomize the rapidly growing array of
              environmental challenges that no single discipline or constituency can solve
              individually.  This IGERT award supports the establishment of a new
              multidisciplinary graduate program that includes trainers and students from ten
              multidisciplinary graduate groups and professional schools at UC Davis, as well
              as non-faculty participants from state, federal and national organizations who
              will strengthen ties to policymakers, legislators, regulators, and other
              stakeholders.  In addition, the program emphasizes the global ramifications of
              invasions through the participation of international authorities, and provides
              support for international research collaborations and individual projects. 
              Trainees will be required to satisfy the degree requirements of the graduate
              group to which they are admitted, as well as the specific requirements of the
              IGERT program that aim to build a multidisciplinary perspective and teamwork. 
              Trainees supported for their dissertations must develop a project that
              integrates two or more of the IGERT core disciplines (life sciences, social
              sciences, law, humanities, and physical sciences), and have a similarly diverse
              guidance committee.  The formal training program begins with an integrative
              first-year foundation curriculum, consisting of a lecture/seminar series,
              discussion groups, and hands-on technical demonstrations.  This foundation
              program will be followed by a second-year group collaborative research project,
              involving trainees and faculty, that analyzes an invaded habitat or ecosystem
              from biological, social, historical, economic, and legal perspectives, and
              develops a comprehensive management plan.  This project will lead to an annual
              spring workshop, with participants from academia, the private and public
              sectors, and relevant stakeholders speaking directly to the problem addressed. 
              Other key elements of the training program include requirements for
              collaborative internships outside the university and participation in an
              extensive mentorship network.  This program will build multidisciplinary
              research teams that span the natural sciences, social sciences, engineering and
              humanities and that will train the next generation of environmental scientists
              to be conversant in the ethical, political, legal, and economic, and scientific
              issues pertinent to the analysis and remediation of biological
              invasions.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of
              educating Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the multidisciplinary backgrounds
              and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career
              demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in
              graduate education by establishing new, innovative models for graduate
              education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that
              transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. In the fourth year of the
              program, awards are being made to twenty-two institutions for programs that
              collectively span all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF. The
              intellectual foci of this specific award reside in the Directorates for
              Biological Sciences; Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences; Mathematical
              and Physical Sciences; Engineering; and Education and Human Resources.
