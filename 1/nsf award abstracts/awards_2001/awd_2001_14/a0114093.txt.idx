Abstract    :
              This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program  and the
              Major Research Instrumentation  program to Colorado state University will fund
              the purchase of an integrated field emission scanning electron microscope
              (FE-SEM) system for the central Electron Microscopy Center at Colorado State
              University.  The equipment requested will allow imaging specimens at high
              resolution, providing resolution of structures as small as 1.5 nanometers.  An
              energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system will allow chemical identification,
              with the capability of precisely mapping multiple elements over a wide area.  A
              third component of the instrumentation will enable investigators to produce
              nanoscale devices using electron beam lithography.  This technique, in
              conjunction with the high resolution FE-SEM will allow generation of structures
              as small as 10 nm for applications in optoelectronic materials,
              superconductors, and sensors.  The instrumentation will support the research
              efforts of seven primary investigators from five departments across campus.  In
              addition, it will be  useed by research groups in 8 other departments at CSU as
              well as several other investigators (both academic and industrial) from along
              the Colorado Front Range.  Finally, the FE-SEM will be used to support and
              extend the teaching mission of the EM center and the University through
              hands-on instruction and telepresence microscopy.  This award from the
              Instrumentation for Material Research program and the Major Research
              Instrumentation program  to Colorado State University will fund the purchase of
              an integrated system of imaging and analytical tools that will greatly expand
              the capabilities of the Electron Microscopy (EM) Center at Colorado State
              University.  The state-of-the-art scanning electron microscope (SEM) will allow
              imaging of both biological and materials specimens at the highest
              magnifications currently possible.  In addition, an x-ray analyzer attached to
              the microscope will provide identification of most elements in the periodic
              table and will map their locations with high precision on specimen surfaces. 
              The electron beam lithography system, coupled with the SEM will allow
              production of micro- and nanoscopic structures that will be used in a variety
              of optical and electrical devices, such as light emitting diodes, semiconductor
              lasers, and highly efficient sensors and detectors.  The educational mission of
              science and engineering departments across the CSU campus will also be enhanced
              by the acquisition of this instrumentation through hands-on instruction and
              remote access via telepresence microscopy.
