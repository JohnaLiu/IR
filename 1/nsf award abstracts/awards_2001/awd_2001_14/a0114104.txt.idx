Abstract    :
              X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is one of the most useful methods for the
              analysis of surfaces, interfaces and thin films; with sensitivity at the
              nanometer scale. It is a critical tool for basic and applied research and
              development of new semiconductors, biomaterials, fuel cells, gene chips,
              amorphous metals, optical fibers, and optical/electronic polymers. This
              materials research is enabling to the advancement of telecommunications,
              computers, energy and biotechnology where XPS plays an additional role in
              manufacturing science and quality control. This award from the Instrumentation
              for Material research program will allow Penn State to purchase a new
              state-of-the-art XPS, increasing the availability for undergraduate students,
              graduate students, faculty and staff various fields of materials and
              engineering research. The instrument will also be vital to teaching a number of
              courses that detail the theory and practice of XPS, and for hands on training
              with access to modern equipment.   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is
