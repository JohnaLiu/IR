Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Rowan University  will acquire a 400 MHz NMR
              Spectrometer. In addition, funds are awarded to upgrade a 200 MHz NMR, which
              Rowan will donate to Richard Stockton College.  The 400 MHz instrument will be
              used to support at least nine active investigations in two departments at Rowan
              University; a) the investigation of silica/silicate networks in acqueous
              solutions of silicic acid; b) characterization of fluoroacrylate-acrylate and
              -methacrylate co-polymers; c) magnetization-transfer NMR analysis of network
              formation in polymer gels; d) studying biomolecular recognition; e) 13C
              NMR-supported pyrolysis studies; f) development of solid polymer electrolytes
              for Li+ and H+ transport; g) silicon carbide fiber processing; h) protein
              structure determination; and i) controlled drug release studies.  The upgraded
              200 MHz instrument will be used at Richard Stockton College to support
              laboratory instruction and the synthesis and characterization of unique
              surfactants.     Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR
              spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
              The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas
              including materials chemistry, biochemistry and chemical engineering.
