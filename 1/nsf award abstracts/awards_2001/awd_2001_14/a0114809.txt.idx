Abstract    :
              This research and educational program will address the quantum-mechanical
              transport and storage of electrons and holes in ultra-thin, heteroinsulator
              nanostructures.The nanostructures are comprised of an oxide-nitride-oxide
              (ONO)gate dielectric.    This research focuses on the quantum-mechanical
              aspects of charge trapping in ultra-thin ONO dielectrics.  This project will
              employ a combination of novel test structures,such as linear voltage ramp and
              charge pumping,o determine the spatial and energetic distribution of traps in
              the silicon nitride and oxynitride storage layers and in the Si-SiO 2
              interfacial region on the opposite side of the tunnel oxide.  A variation of
              material parameters to examine retention and endurance of scaled novel SONOS
              devices in the program (write) and erase modes as a function of operational
              temperature.  This research addresses the incorporation of hydrogen and
              deuterium in the SONOS device to provide long-term retention under
              extensiveerase/write cycling at elevated temperatures; it will also address the
              effect of the gate electrode on the charge distribution and long-term memory
              retention.  Advanced fabrication techniques are used to grow ultra-thin tunnel
              oxides and analytical characterization techniques, such as AFM,TEM and
              angle-resolved XPS are employed to analyze the spatial and compositional
              structure of these ultra-thin dielectrics.  This research seeks to understand
              charge trapping and storage in ultra-thin multi-dielectrics in advanced
              semiconductor devices while offering a strong educational program and link to
              industrial partnerships.
