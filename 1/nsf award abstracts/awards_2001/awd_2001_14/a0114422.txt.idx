Abstract    :
              The Center for Cosmological Physics brings together astronomers and physicists,
              experimentalists and theorists, to address the most fundamental questions in
              modern cosmology.  It establishes an interdisciplinary environment essential
              to address the cross-disciplinary problems, thereby fostering an ideal climate
              for nurturing new talent (students and postdocs) and stimulating faculty and
              other senior scientists to think in different directions.  Measurements of the
              remnants of the early universe will be performed by Center scientists; this
              data will be interpreted by them and center theorists to reconstruct
              the conditions and laws in effect at the earliest moments of the
              Universe.  Experiments in Cosmology over the past decade have revealed
              phenomena which are simply not understandable in our "Standard Models."  Thus
              they constitute important clues to the deepest secrets of nature. 
              These include the fact that most of the matter in the Universe is "dark"
              and appears to only interact gravitationally;  that most of the energy in
              the Universe is of a mysterious form whose dynamics is totally unknown;
              that points on the sky which have apparently never been in contact with
              each other have the same temperature to very high precision;  and that
              there are particles striking the Earth with energies well beyond what we
              can understand.  The Center exploits the interrelations among these
              phenomena and will address them with new experiments and new insights.
