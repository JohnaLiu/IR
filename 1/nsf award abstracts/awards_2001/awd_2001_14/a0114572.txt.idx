Abstract    :
              0114572 Lombardi  Description: This award is to support a collaborative
              project between Dr. John Lombardi, Department of Chemistry, CUNY City College,
              New York, NY and Dr. Serdar Ozcelik, Department of Chemistry, Bilkent
              University, Ankara, Turkey.  They plan to investigate the electro-optical
              properties of J-aggregates.  They plan to measure the change in dipole moments
              to study the nature and relative importance of the intermolecular interactions
              that lead to aggregate formation. They will study the effects of electric
              fields on molecular events (absorption and fluorescence) to gain basic
              understanding of nanostructural materials that would be useful in
              nanotechnology.  They plan to utilize Stark spectroscopic methods for these
              studies.  Scope: The project supports collaboration between two scientists
              with complementary expertise and resources to investigate an important problem.
               The results will help with designing of materials useful for nanotechnology
              applications.  Professor Lombardi is an expert in Stark spectroscopy.  He will
              advise on building up a Stark spectrometer at Bilkent University and will
              participate in the analysis and simulation of the electroabsorption data.  Dr.
              Ozcelik will supervise the preparation of the film sample, UV-Vis absorption,
              fluorescence, electroabsorption and electric field modulated fluorescence
              measurements.  Students at CCNY/CUNY will benefit from this collaboration, and
              one graduate student will visit Bilkent University to work on the project. 
              This project meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in
              areas of mutual interest.
