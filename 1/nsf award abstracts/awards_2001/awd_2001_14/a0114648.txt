Development of
              laser-capture microdissection for plant tissues

Abstract
The technique of
              laser-capture microdissection (LCM) will be developed and optimized for plant
              tissues. This is a method originally developed for animal tissues, whereby
              individual cells are harvested by tacking them to a plastic film with a
              low-power infrared laser that can be aimed at single cells while viewing the
              tissue slice under a microscope. Using this method, it should be possible to
              recover specific cell types or developmental stages from complex tissues
              consisting of many cell types. Cells recovered in this manner can be analyzed
              with regard to gene expression profiles, protein profiles, and other
              properties. Based on preliminary data, it will be necessary to test a variety
              of tissue fixation and sectioning methods to adapt the method to plants. This
              project will optimize the LCM technique, using a variety of plant tissue
              sources and purity markers for specific cells. Detailed protocols will be
              provided to the biological community at the website
              http://plantgenomics.biology.yale.edu.
