Abstract    :
              Determining the function of a network of genes

Definition of "determining the
              function"

In our project, we will define the function of approximately 10
              new genes from Arabidopsis that are functionally related because they are part
              of the RPM1 disease resistance pathway. Our definition of function will
              entail:
1. Detailed information on the role of these genes in disease
              resistance.
2. Broader definition of extra functions that we may uncover for
              these genes. For example, we already know that reduction of function of at
              least two of them causes meristem defects. At present, this may be simple
              pleiotropy. It also may be relevant, meaning that the genes in question have
              additional functions in plant growth. 

URLs where the public can get
              information on their accession numbers in GenBank or other identifiers in a
              publicly accessible database

Our data will be published and our results will
              also be available on our lab web site
              at:

http://www.bio.unc.edu/faculty/dangl/lab/superpage.html

As an example
              of how we release web based data,
              see:

What, how and where
              the results will be shared

We will share our results well before publication
              at the annual Arabidopsis meeting.

Significance of the proposed work in
              relation to the 2010 Project objectives

Our work will dovetail with more
              general functional genomics proposals funded in 2010. It is necessary to
              incorporate hypothesis driven functional genomics results, such as the data we
              intend to generate, with the gene family and whole genome data generated by
              others.

Broader Impact

Disease resistance is a significant problem in
              agriculture. We will add to the body of knowledge that will eventually lead to
              more effective control of plant disease. This is vital because we currently
              lose up to 30% of crop yield to pathogens and pests.
