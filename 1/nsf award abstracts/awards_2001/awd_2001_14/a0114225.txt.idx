Abstract    :
              This award supports a workshop will bring together leading scholars with
              expertise on longitudinal studies in cultural and physical anthropology,
              epidemiology, economics, sociology, public health, and psychology.  During the
              workshop they will highlight the importance and power of using longitudinal
              research designs for studying questions of social and biological change;
              identify areas of consensus and disagreement, develop practical guidelines that
              cut across disciplines and qualitative or quantitative methods of doing
              longitudinal studies; and identify how best to join qualitative and
              quantitative methods in longitudinal studies.  The workshop will also assess
              the feasibility of designing a training workshop for graduate students of
              cultural and physical anthropology and other disciplines to teach qualitative
              and quantitative research methods for longitudinal research and techniques to
              analyze such information.  This workshop activity has the potential to make a
              significant advance in the scientific capacity of cultural anthropology
