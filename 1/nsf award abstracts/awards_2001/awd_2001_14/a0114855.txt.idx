Abstract    :
              The partners of the Louis Stokes Missouri Alliance for Minority Participation
              (LS-MoAMP) are proposing to move the consortium into a Phase II initiative. The
              new phase focuses on increasing baccalaureate production by fifteen percent
              annually over a five-year period. A primary strategy proposed to support that
              objective is to include all four-year public institutions in the partnership
              for Phase II, increasing the collaborative by four institutions: Truman State
              University, Missouri Western State College, Missouri Southern State College,
              and Northwest Missouri State University. This addition is expected to increase
              participation by twenty-five percent. The alliance's baseline and degree target
              is adjusted to reflect this addition.
