Abstract    :
              We propose development of a network layer protocol necessary to increase the
              utility of acoustic communications in the shallow water environment.
              Increasing attention has been given to collecting data from difficult to
              access coastal waters for diverse activities, to include scientific research,
              industrial and commercial concerns, and military applications. The
              preponderance of activity has focused on developing reliable methods for
              transmitting the information collected through the difficult
              time-varying shallow water medium. However, current network layer protocols,
              which are responsible for determining traffic routing, do not provide for
              guaranteed quality of services. Current protocols also may cause unnecessary
              message delays. The delivery of traffic in an acoustic network is complicated
              by the excessive propagation delays resulting from the speed of sound in
              water. The effect of this propagation speed is to cause an acoustic network
              connected by short hops to perform similar to a wire-based network with links
              between neighboring nodes of over 100,000 kilometers. However, the potential
              benefits and increased potential for application developments that stem from
              the implementation of wireless underwater networks make it worthwhile to
              explore means of mitigating the effects of the propagation delays. Central to
              the problem of route determination for network traffic is the discovery of the
              networks topology from which network nodes extract next-hop information upon
              which to base traffic forwarding decisions. Two principal methods are used for
              discovering the route information. Proactive routing methods pre-compute route
              data before network traffic is generated, thus when traffic is submitted
              by network applications the appropriate routes are already known. Reactive
              routing determines the route information in response to traffic submissions.
              This method, referred to as on-demand routing, seeks to minimize route
              discovery traffic by only determining routes necessary to support actual
              traffic patterns. This routing information is cached to increase
              responsiveness to submitted traffic and adaptability to topology changes. Both
              methods have their merits; however, neither adequately supports
              resource allocations necessary to assure guaranteed levels of service
              quality. We proposed a novel network protocol that provides many of the
              benefits of proactive routing yet retains the adaptability of reactive
              protocols. Our protocol is based upon a central master node which periodically
              probes the network for active participant nodes. In responding to the probes,
              the nodes provide the master node with sufficient information for the master
              node to determine all possible data paths through the network. From this
              information the master node makes all routing decisions for the network and
              provides irnext-hoply information to each non-master node, thus reducing the
              workload on non-master nodes. This information also enables the master node to
              optimize the allocation of traffic to network paths providing for active
              management of delays insuring delay variance and data capacity are within the
              established quality of service commitments. Fundamental to this approach is
              the separation of control traffic from data delivery. This separation allows
              data to be transmitted without first having to wait for traditional handshake
              mechanisms to provide access to the channel. This separation significantly
              reduces the expected delay to which traffic is subjected resulting in
              potentially higher data throughput. Progress in network layer protocols will
              expand the usefulness of underwater acoustic networks beyond applications that
              are limited to very low data rate traffic and non-time sensitive data
              types. Specific beneficiaries of this research activity include the Deployable
              Autonomous Distributed System, the SeaWeb Technology Demonstrations, the
              Autonomous Oceanographic Sampling Network, and the National Oceanographic
              partnership Programs Front Resolving Observational Network with
              Telemetry (FRONT) project.
