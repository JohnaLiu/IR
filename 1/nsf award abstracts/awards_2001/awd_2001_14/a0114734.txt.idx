Abstract    :
              The St. Louis Public Schools (SLPS) serving 42,673 students, of which 81.7% are
              eligible for free/reduced lunch, 15.3% are students with disabilities, 80% are
              African American, 17.4% White-non-Hispanic, 1.5% Asian/Pacific Islander, and
              1.1% Hispanic, through the St. Louis Urban Systemic Program (SLUSP), proposes
              to build upon the substantial accomplishments realized under the St. Louis
              Urban Systemic Initiative (USI) to implement strategies that ensure effective
              teaching and student success in science and mathematics in all schools
              throughout the District.  The District's policies bearing on mathematics and
              science graduation requirements, teacher and other staff professional
              development, and accountability programs conjoined to student achievement,
              student assessment and program evaluation, curriculum designs
              objectives/indicators coupled to explicit student learning outcomes, the annual
              performance standards for each school, school-based management, and infusion of
              technology into the delivery of instruction serve as the framework, enablers
              and direction for the overall reform process.   The goals of the SLUSP
              include improving the implementation of standards-based, inquiry-centered
              science and mathematics education with technology infusion for all students,
              pre-K-12; increasing the competency of the science and mathematics
              instructional workforce; expanding the collaborations with colleges and
              universities for the production of science and mathematics teachers; and
              increasing the number of skilled entrants into the technology-based
              workforce.  The District's program is informed by an implementation strategy
              that includes the following elements: - Full implementation of the
              standards-based, inquiry-centered science and mathematics education program
              with technology infusion for all students, pre-K-12; - Ensuring that the fully
              implemented program is a seamless, unitary teaching and learning sequence with
              regard to the continuum of the standards-based curriculum, instruction, and
              assessments with distributed accountability for student learning; - Increasing
              the competency of the science and mathematics instructional workforce through
              professional development and teacher education programs characterized by
              demanding content and performance standards; and - Enhancing teaching and
              learning outcomes through the use of state-of-the-art technologies and student
              support programs.  The SLUSP has defined Student Achievement
              Benchmarks/Targets, inclusive of baseline data, to be attained in four areas of
              student achievement: 1) performance on the mathematics and science portions of
              the statewide tests administered by the Missouri Achievement Program (MAP),
               2) performance on the mathematics and science portions of the District-wide
              TerraNova achievement tests,  3) numbers enrolling in, and the percentage
              completing, selected advanced high school courses in mathematics and science,
              and 4) numbers taking, and the scores achieved on, college placement exams
              such as the SAT and ACT.    In addition, even higher improvement benchmarks
              for the District's black students were formulated explicitly in order to narrow
              the existing differences between white and black students on higher level math
              and science courses and on college placement exams.
