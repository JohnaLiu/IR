Abstract    :
              This dissertation improvement grant is a multi-sited ethnography of the
              constructions of race, social class, and gender in epidemiologic and
              experiential accounts of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks and causes. Data
              collection methods include participant observation at scientific meetings,
              interviews with cardiovascular epidemiologists, and interviews with persons of
              color living with CVD. This project explores how ideas about racial, class, and
              gender differences are conceptualized and stabilized in epidemiologic knowledge
              production. How epidemiologists manage and navigate disputes over the
              inclusion, measurement, and interpretation of race, class, and gender, and
              sustain the validity of their work in the face of such controversies are
              examined. This research also analyzes how individuals living with CVD
              understand, take up, and/or reconstruct epidemiologic knowledge about racial,
              class, and gender differences in risk. The influence of people's social
              contexts and relationships with biomedical institutions on responses to and
              renegotiation of scientific claims are important here. Finally, this project
              examines how epidemiologic and experiential definitions of race, class, and
              gender shape what we know about the causes of CVD inequalities, and participate
              in processes of racial, class, and gender formation.
