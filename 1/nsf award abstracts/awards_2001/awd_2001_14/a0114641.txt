This grant provides partial support of the costs of
              acquiring a new electron microprobe for the Department of Geology at the
              University of California, Davis. The Principal Investigators are all teaching
              and research faculty members in the Department of Geology.   The P.I.'s, their
              students, and collaborators will utilize this instrument to further their
              research on  (1) Mafic clay minerals, palagonitization, and biomineralization, 
               (2) Metamorphic geology and tectonics of convergent plate margins, (3)
              Regional metamorphism and the tectonics of mountain belts,   (4) Field and
              experimental studies in igneous processes, and (5) Thermodynamic studies of
              minerals and ceramics.   In addition, the new electron microprobe will be used
              extensively by many other investigators in the Department of Geology, as well
              as the Departments of Chemistry, Physics, Chemical Engineering and Material
              Science, Agricultural Engineering, Land Air and Water Sciences, and the School
              of Veterinary Medicine.   Although the new electron microprobe will be housed
              and administered within the Department of Geology, it will be part of a
              recognized campus-wide analytical facility that is available to researchers
              across the UC Davis campus as well as from other colleges, universities, and
              research organizations across Northern California.
