Abstract    :
              0114527  Elimelech  The objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive
              microscopic-level understanding of the thermodynamics and micro-hydrodynamics
              of concentration polarization and cake formation in crossflow membrane
              filtration.  A major emphasis will be placed on the identification of the
              transition point from a disordered liquid-like phase in the concentration
              polarization layer to an ordered solid-like cake layer. The research will
              involve the following tasks: 1) Prediction of the equilibrium structure of a
              colloidal dispersion, 2) Evaluation of the osmotic pressure, sedimentation
              coefficient and diffusion coefficient, 3) Prediction of the liquid-solid
              transition point in colloidal systems under crossflow membrane filtration
              conditions, 4) Prediction of the extent of concentration polarization and/or
              cake formation and the resulting permeate flux decline behavior, 5) Selection
              of a model experimental system for validation of the theory and 6) Experimental
              validation of the above theoretical approach using model colloidal dispersions
              at various background electrolyte concentrations, particle concentrations, pH,
              crossflow velocities and operating pressures. This research is expected to lead
              to a sound theoretical basis for quantification of permeate flux decline
              behavior in crossflow membrane filtration of colloidal dispersions.  These
              results will become increasingly important as membrane processes, particularly
              nanofiltration and ultrafiltration, become more viable for treatment of natural
              and waste waters because these technologies offer a comprehensive approach to
              meeting multiple water quality objectives for a myriad of dissolved and
              colloidal contaminants. ***
