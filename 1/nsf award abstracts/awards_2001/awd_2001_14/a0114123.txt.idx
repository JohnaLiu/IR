              ABSTRACT  CTS-0114123 Lee, Lloyd L/ U of Oklahoma   Nanostructured materials
              are currently being developed for use in molecular adsorption and molecular
              recognition. The design and selection of sensor materials [65,66] in commercial
              use have been mostly done by trial and error and qualitative thinking, rather
              than with tailor-made specificity and quantitative principles. With the
              development of the nanostructured materials, such as self-assembled monolayers
              (SAMs) and dendritic structures, there have been created a vast menu of
              chemical and physical properties for selection. We need to have a molecular
              level understanding of the nature and consequence of the molecular interactions
              at play. This research is aimed at establishing a microscopic framework, using
              molecular theory and computer simulation, for gas adsorption in three typical
              nanomaterials: aerogels, zeolites, and starburst dendrimers. This furnishes a
              quantitative principle rooted in the molecular level that shall aid in the
              design and development of gas adsorption and molecular recognition
              devices.  There are, broadly speaking, older nanomaterials (e.g., zeolites,
              membranes, aerogels, activated carbons, etc.) and newer ones (e.g., star
              polymers, dendrimers, etc.)  What happens to the gases (fluids) included in
              these substrates with respect to their molecular distributions, isosteric heats
              of adsorption, phase behavior, thermodynamic properties, adsorption isotherms,
              separation efficiency (for mixtures), selective adsorption, and partition
              coefficients? An accurate molecular theory and well-targeted molecular
              simulation are needed that give the probabilistic densities of distribution of
              the confined gases around the ordered substrates, as well as their theoretical
              connections to the thermodynamic properties. This is properly the task for our
              statistical mechanics of adsorption.  The principal investigator will develop
              a new integral equation (IE) theory and perform molecular computer simulation
              to determine the gas structures (distribution functions) and thermodynamic
              properties of inclusion gases and gas mixtures around nanostructures.  He uses
              the existing replica Ornsterin-Zernike (ROZ) equations as a starting point.
              New forms will be developed for the inclusion gas in random as well as regular
              media, and in rigid as well as deformable adsorbents. The conventional ROZ can
              treat only inrigidlo matrices.  He uses a two-temperature quench procedure to
              formulate a new equation for responsive systems. In addition, consistency is
              achieved by designing a new closure relation satisfying a set of exact
              self-consistency principles. The principal investigator stresses that without
              this closure relation, a good one at that, no integral equations can achieve
              high consistency, nor accuracy. Monte Carlo molecular simulations and molecular
              dynamics will be carried out to determine the mechanism of adsorption and to
              test the theories.
