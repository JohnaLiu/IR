Abstract    :
              Decadal-scale changes in the production cycles of the sub-Arctic Pacific Ocean
              have been conjectured to effect population changes in fishes via their
              zooplankton forage base. Zooplankton populations occurring near the Gulf of
              Alaska continental shelf break appear to undergo dramatic oscillations in
              abundance over decadal time scales. These consist principally of inter-zonal
              (because life-history stages span shallow- and deep-water zones) zooplankton
              (primarily Neocalanus spp. copepods) stocks that are driven onto the shelf
              providing the ecosystem with an important forage base.

The data arising from
              this project will enable the assessment of seasonal (during 2001 and 2003) and
              inter-annual 15N/14N and 13C/12C variability of large-bodied zooplankton
              (primarily Neocalanus) across the Gulf of Alaska continental shelf during their
              peak occurrence in spring and summer each year, that will be matched to
              analogous measurements for juvenile pink salmon and other fishes. These data
              will be used to isotopically characterize coastal and oceanic (offshore)
              organic carbon sources and their utilization by fishes. Isotopic shifts in
              fishes and diapausing copepods are expected to shift in synchrony varying
              proportionately with the intensity of cross-shelf transport.  This project will
              augment and complement existing and continuing core LTOP observations being
              made along the Seward Line transect (GAK1 to GAK13) and select stations near
              and in Prince William Sound. Samples that were acquired by the P.I. from fall
              1997 through summer 2000 on pilot LTOP project (Weingartner, P.I.) cruises will
              be analyzed for 13C/12C and 15N/14N content as part of this project during
              FY2001 and FY2002. Additional samples will be collected and analyzed as part of
              this project from 2001 through 2005.  The data will also be used to validate
              the tacit assumption in NEP GLOBEC retrospective studies that 15N/14N values of
              lower food chain biota are constant so that so that changing values can be
              interpreted to reflect varying food chain length or salmon run size.
