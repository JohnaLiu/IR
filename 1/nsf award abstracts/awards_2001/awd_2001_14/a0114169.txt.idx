Abstract    :
              0114169  Pavlostathis  The objective of this research is the in-depth assessment
              of the microbial reductive transformation and decolorization potential of
              anthraquinone and phthalocyanine reactive dyes.  Several commercial dyes as
              well as model compounds will be used.  The target dyes will be characterized,
              and their redox chemistry investigated.  Specific analytical techniques, which
              are currently lacking, will be developed for the identification and
              quantification of the parent dyes as well as their transformed products.  The
              kinetics and extent of abiotic, chemical and microbial reductive transformation
              and decolorization of the target dyes will be assessed.  Mechanistic aspects of
              electron transfer during the reductive decolorization of the target dyes and
              the use of electron mediators for the potential enhancement of the
              decolorization process will be investigated.  To further evaluate reductive
              biodecolorization under more realistic conditions, the decolorization process
              will be evaluated using a continuous-flow, fixed-film bioreactor under saline
              conditions typically encountered in commercial textile reactive dyebaths. 
              Experimental measurements in both batch and continuous-flow systems will be
              used to develop mathematical models for the quantitative description of the
              reductive biodecolorization of the target dyes, including the potential
              beneficial effect of electron transfer mediators. ***
