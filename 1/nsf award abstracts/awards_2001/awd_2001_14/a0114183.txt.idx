Abstract    :
              This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program will enable
              the University of Virginia to develop a variable temperature near field
              scanning acoustic microscope to map elastic properties on a nanometer scale on
              solids of interest to physics, chemistry, materials science, biology and
              engineering and to enhance teaching in the physics undergraduate laboratory. 
              The microscope will use custom designed scanning heads with integrated
              cantilever sensors capable of operation at low temperatures and interfaced to
              existing control electronics. A low vibration refrigerator of the pulse tube
              type (which has no moving parts) will be acquired and used to cool the scanning
              head.  The choice of the pulse tube refrigerator (which operate in any physical
              orientation) enables the positioning of  the scanning head on top facilitating
              rapid sample access.  The integrated cantilever sensing scheme will simplify
              the future marriage of the microscope to other instruments such as electron
              microscopes.  It will also enable study of biological samples and solid liquid
              interfaces where optical detection schemes do not work.. The integrated
              detection scheme should also be attractive to emerging industrial
              microelectronics where rapid nanometer scale flaw detection is desired.  This
              award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program, the University
              of Virginia will develop a new microscope using high frequency sound waves and
              operating over a wide temperature range to map elastic features on a nanometer
              length scale in solid state materials of interest to physics, materials
              science, biology and engineering as well as to enhance teaching in the physics
              undergraduate laboratory. The microscope will be of the scanning type and
              images will be obtained digitally. The acoustic sensor for the microscope will
              be fabricated using integrated microelectronic technologies.  This integrated
              sensor scheme simplifies the future marriage of the proposed microscope to
              other instruments such as electron microscopes.  It will also enable the
              imaging of biological samples and solid liquid interfaces with resolution
              better than that obtained optically. The development of this new scanning
              acoustic microscope will benefit the study of crystalline and non-crystalline
              solids and will have a wide ranging impact including in the area of emerging
              microelectronic processes where rapid nanometer scale flaw detection is
              desired.
