Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to improve the capability of controlling the
              gas tungsten arc welding process for precise joining by emulating skilled
              operators using intelligent automatic welding machines in order to produce
              quality welds consistently.  To this end, a novel sensing and control system
              will be developed to measure and control the three-dimensional surface of the
              weld pool.  A new technique will be used to modify the traditional gas tungsten
              arc welding process for better arc concentration and directionality.  A
              numerical model will be developed to analyze the behaviors of the modified
              process under the varying welding parameters in order to simulate the
              performance of the developed control technology.    The scope of work
              addresses basic physics, dynamic modeling, and robust control issues. The
              research team will closely collaborate with industrial partners and
              governmental scientists on both the basic research and applied issues.  The
              investigator includes a plan to educate graduate students in both the
              fundamental science integration and potential for industrial applications.  The
              investigator also plans to accept undergraduate and talented high school
              students, including those from under-represented groups, to work on carefully
              defined topics during the research.  In addition to the social impact, the
              impact on industry should also be significant and several industrial partners
              are committed to case study support and equipment/engineering support for the
              future development of this novel technology at production level.
