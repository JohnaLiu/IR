Abstract    :
              This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program and the Major
              Research Instrumentation program will provide Case Western Reserve University
              (CWRU) partial funding for acquisition of 200 kV Field-Emission Gun,
              Energy-Filtering Transmission Electron Microscope, (EFTEM) LEO 923 LCs FEG
              OMEGA. The instrument will be for the Center for Surface Analysis of Materials
              (CSAM).  CSAM provides instrument access to researchers and students from
              numerous departments across the campus as well as to researchers at any Ohio
              institution of higher education and to researchers at Federal laboratories,
              such as Wright Patterson Air Force Base and NASA Glenn Research Center. The new
              instrument complements the current instrumentation in CSAM with various new
              techniques of energy-filtering transmission electron microscopy, including
              zero-loss imaging, quantitative electron diffraction, and electron
              spectroscopic imaging. The synergy of its outstanding capabilities of
              high-resolution imaging, energy-filtering, and high spatial resolution chemical
              micro-analysis renders the LEO 923 a particularly powerful tool for studying
              the structure, composition, and electronic structure of a large variety of
              materials, including nanomaterials. EFTEM constitutes a new, enabling
              characterization tool in materials science. The Department of Materials Science
              and Engineering at CWRU has taken steps to increase the fraction of women
              undergraduates among the users of the proposed instrument, through programs
              with Ursuline College and through the Summer Program for Undergraduate
              Research.  The award will strengthen ongoing collaborative research projects
              with two historically black colleges- Fisk and Tuskegee University - are
              already in place and more are planned. The proposed acquisition will enable a
              broad variety of research projects, including research in nanostructured
              epitaxial semiconductor heterosystems, electrodeposited metallization layers,
              nanocapacitors for memory devices, metal-matrix nanocomposites,
              micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), thermal barrier coatings, and
              wide-bandgap semiconductors.  This award from the Instrumentation for
              Materials Research program and the Major Research Instrumentation program will
              provide Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) partial funding for acquisition
              of 200 kV Field-Emission Gun, Energy-Filtering Transmission Electron
              Microscope, (EFTEM) LEO 923 LCs FEG OMEGA. The instrument will be for the
              Center for Surface Analysis of Materials. The center provides instrument access
              to researchers and students from numerous departments across the campus. The
              Department of Materials Science and Engineering at CWRU has taken steps to
