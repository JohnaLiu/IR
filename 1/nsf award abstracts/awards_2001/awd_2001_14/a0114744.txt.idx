Abstract    :
              The Center for Health Management Research, then based at Arizona State
              University (since moved to the University of Washington), received its initial
              designation as an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in July 1992.
               From the outset, this has been a multi-university center, drawing its academic
              resources from a consortium of 15 universities.  The goals for the Center are
              to:  1) Develop a research agenda in collaboration with the corporate members;
              2) Undertake research, development, and evaluation projects on behalf of the
              corporate members; 3) Disseminate to the members findings of health services
              research; 4) Identify and disseminate to the members successful innovations and
              management practices from other health care organizations; and 4) Identify and
              disseminate to the members relevant research findings, successful innovations,
              and management practices from other industries.
