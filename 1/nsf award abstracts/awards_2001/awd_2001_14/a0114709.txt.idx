Abstract    :
              Abstract: This study examines energy loss mechanisms during the transition of a
              cable from a slack state to a taut state and undertakes optimization of the
              associated energy loss for use in design of low-tech/low cost/high performance
              dampers for mitigation of seismic damage in structures. Cables comprised of
              helical wires wound around a central core to form a strand or strands wrapped
              helically around another strand will be modeled to capture axial, flexural and
              torsional displacements.  Dynamic friction at the contact points or lines
              between wires absorbs energy and affects the responses.  Understanding these
              effects will enable design of a snapping cable energy dissipater that does not
              produce harmful shock to the structure, yet dissipates sufficient energy and/or
              adds sufficient stiffness to be effective in reducing damage induced by seismic
              events.    It is anticipated that this analytical, numerical, and
              experimental research program leads to a novel and effective tool in the effort
              to protect lives and property during earthquakes and other natural or man-made
              hazards.  Additionally, during the course of the research, techniques and
              results will be incorporated into courses cross-listed in Civil Engineering and
              Mechanics at Virginia Tech and the participation of undergraduate research
              students will be encouraged.
