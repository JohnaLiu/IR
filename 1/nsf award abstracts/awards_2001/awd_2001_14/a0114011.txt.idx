Abstract    :
              The proposed research is aimed at designing and developing new resources for
              information and knowledge management in a heterogeneous distributed environment
              for law enforcement.  Important problem areas to be addressed are: system
              scalability, group-based monitoring of dynamically changing data, analyzing
              group behavior in search and notification, and incremental searching, among
              others The technical approach will be implemented in an agent-based framework
              and empirical studies will be performed to evaluate the proposed prototype in
              two law enforcement agencies.
