Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is designed to
              contribute to better and more efficient management of a part of our natural
              resources.  Current analyses of fish stocks (by National Marine Fisheries
              Service and several state departments of fish & game) are unnecessarily
              expensive, time-consuming and inaccurate.  Ultimately, this contributes to
              compromised Government resource management policy-making.  The result is the
              risk of over fishing and considerable economic damage.  Via research and
              development this project will produce a prototype integrated 'plug & play'
              system to automate these analyses.

The developed system will be marketed
              first to the several dozens of U. S. federal and state agencies having a need
              for it, and thereby will help to establish more precise measurement standards
              that will be accepted by the worldwide community.  The subsequent result of
              worldwide marketing activity will benefit the fish management and research
              activities in more than 20 countries, and solidify the U. S. developed and
              promulgated standards and measurement techniques.
