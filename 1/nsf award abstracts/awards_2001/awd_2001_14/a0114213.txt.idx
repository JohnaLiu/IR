Abstract    :
              This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program and the
              Instrumentation for Materials Research Program to the University of
              Wisconsin-Eau Claire provides partial support for the acquisition of a x-ray
              photoelectron spectroscopy system for research and undergraduate education and
              training.  The instrument will be used to investigate the physics and chemistry
              of semiconductors, thin films, and metallic alloys. Several different systems
              will be studied. These include: 1) the electronic, chemical, and structural
              properties of compound IV-IV semiconductors, including the passivation,
              oxidation, oxynitridation and metallization; 2) the chemistry of the molecular
              precursors typically used in gallium-nitride and indium-gallium-nitride film
              growth, as well as the chemistry of the molecular fragments from such
              precursors; 3) the growth mechanisms and structures of thin metal films on
              semiconductors; and 4) corrosion processes of metal alloys and thin films.
              Since undergraduate research is a critical component of the educational system
              at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, students will perform research with
              the new instrument.  It will be used in course work and will be used to educate
              and train students in materials research.  This award from the Major Research
              Instrumentation program and the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program
              to the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire provides partial support for the
              acquisition of an x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) system for research
              and undergraduate education and training. Semiconductors, metals, and
              insulators are the materials that make microelectronic chips possible. Nearly
              all computer chips, for example, are fabricated from silicon.  Similar
              materials and used in electro-optic devices, such as light-emitting diodes used
              in many consumer electronics and increasingly in the automotive industry and
              roadway signing, and diode lasers, which form the heart of laser printers and
              compact disc players. The successful fabrication of computer chip and
              electro-optic devices requires a detailed understanding of the physics and
              chemistry of the interface between two materials, as well as fundamental
              processes occurring on the surface of these materials.  Surface properties and
              composition are therefore important to the fabrication of useful devices. X-ray
              photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a technique that provides information about
              surface composition and is capable of providing information about the "chemical
              state" in which surface atoms exist. The instrument will be used to: 1)
              investigate semiconductor and metal surfaces, and how varying surface
              composition of either material influences the interface that forms between two
              dissimilar materials; 2) follow surface chemical reactions relevant to growing
              thin films of materials and how etching reactions proceed at semiconductor and
              metal surfaces; and 3) study how surface composition influences surface
              structure and morphology during film growth and etching. Undergraduate
              students, including students from physical sciences as well as life sciences,
              will be involved in all research projects and will operate and help to maintain
              the new instrument as part of their collaborative research projects with
              faculty research mentors.
