Abstract    :
              0114861 Hunziker This award supports Janet Hunziker of the National Academy of
              Sciences and junior and senior researchers from various U.S. universities to
              participate in an international workshop on several current engineering topics.
               The four primary areas to be covered are 1) medical device technology, 2)
              urban engineering and planning, 3) intelligent transportation systems, and 4)
              environment and renewable energy.  Speakers will be asked to address issues
              such as what the frontiers in their field are; what experiments and prototypes
              are in progress; what new tools and instruments are available; what the major
              impediments to progress are; and what the theoretical, commercial, societal,
              and long-term significance of the work is.  Invitees will be accomplished
              engineers who have made recognized contributions to advancing the frontiers of
              engineering, with half those present from industry and half from academia.  The
              primary benefit of the workshop will be to foster new interactions between the
              best junior U.S. and German engineers from different fields and sectors. 
              Today's most exciting and powerful engineering developments are occurring at
              the intersection of disciplines.  By creating the opportunity for sharing of
              research insights and techniques across a range of fields, this workshop will
              facilitate leaps in knowledge and applications that might otherwise take much
              longer to achieve.
