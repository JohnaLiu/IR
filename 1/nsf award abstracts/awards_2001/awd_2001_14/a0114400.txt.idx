Abstract    :
              The importance of chemical and hydromechanical signaling is broadly recognized
              but inadequately studied. In marine and freshwater systems, chemical signals
              affect critical processes such as feeding, competition, mate recognition,
              habitat choice, host-symbiont and host-pathogen interactions. These chemical
              signals not only directly affect organisms but also produce a cascade of
              indirect effects on population structure, community organization, and ecosystem
              function. Numerous investigations indicate that chemical signals mediate many
              of these ecological interactions in aquatic systems, but exceedingly few
              investigations have coupled aquatic chemical ecology with microbiology, sensory
              biology, physiology, or an understanding of the fluid dynamics that mediate the
              transmission and reception of signals. Few scientists have the requisite
              breadth and cross-disciplinary training in ecology, chemistry, sensory biology,
              microbiology, physiology and small-scale hydrodynamics necessary to advance the
              field of chemical signaling in aquatic systems. The recent NSF workshop on
              challenges and opportunities in biological oceanography (OEUVRE) identified a
              mechanistic understanding of these small-scale chemically and physically
              mediated processes as a major challenge facing this diverse field. Georgia
              Institute of Technology, in collaboration with Skidaway and Scripps
              Institutions of Oceanography, is uniquely positioned to train students to meet
              these challenges. Under this IGERT program, graduate training at Georgia Tech
              will consist of a unique series of integrated core courses, an intensive,
              hands-on class in aquatic signaling where interdisciplinary student teams will
              experimentally investigate projects of their own design, intemships, and
              mentoring by a multidisciplinary graduate committee. Seminars will be conducted
              on biological, chemical and physical interactions affecting aquatic signaling,
              scientific ethics, special issues faced by under-represented groups and women
              in science, and the practical aspects of professional development in science
              and engineering. During the project, IGERT funds will support over 40 graduate
              students, produce about 26 PhDs, and start a permanent center for aquatic
              signaling at Georgia Tech.  IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the
              challenges of educating Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the
              multidisciplinary backgrounds and the technical, professional, and personal
              skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to
              catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing new,
              innovative models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment
              for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.
              In the fourth year of the program, awards are being made to twenty-two
              institutions for programs that collectively span all areas of science and
              engineering supported by NSF. The intellectual foci of this specific award
              reside in the Directorates for Biological Sciences; Geosciences; Mathematical
              and Physical Sciences; Engineering; Education and Human Resources; and the
              Office of Polar Programs.
