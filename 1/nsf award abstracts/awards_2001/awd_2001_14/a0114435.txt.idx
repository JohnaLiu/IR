Abstract    :
              Proposal 0114435  The Center for Bibliographical Studies and Research, in
              partnership with the British Library, will digitize the microfilm of the most
              important collection of 18th century English newspapers.   Newspapers are
              recognized as a vast source of information for the historical dimension of
              virtually every discipline.  This project will provide online access for
              researchers throughout the country. The digitized medium will also provide new
              methods of access and allow experiments in OCR, in interfaces and
              presentation, and in other technological questions.
