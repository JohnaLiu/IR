Abstract    :
                   Two-component systems are the primary means by which bacteria sense and
              respond to environmental stimuli. These systems are comprised of a number of
              distinct elements, namely histidine kinases, response regulators and in the
              case of phosphorelays, histidine phosphotransfer proteins (HPts). Genes
              encoding similar proteins to each of these elements have been identified in
              Arabidopsis, and for the majority of the 35 such genes no function has yet been
              definitively ascribed. An integrated approach to elucidate the function of
              these proteins in Arabidopsis is proposed. A combination of gene knockouts and
              inducible overexpression will be used to assess the roles of these genes in
              plant growth and development. The mutant plant lines will be characterized in
              terms of their response to biotic and abiotic factors such as hormones, light,
              and osmotic stress, and for their pattern of gene expression. Where in the
              plants these genes are expressed will be determined using a combination of GUS
              fusions and in situ RNA analysis. The location of the cognate proteins within
              the cell will also be delineated. To facilitate this localization, a series of
              10 monoclonal antibodies will be generated to marker proteins, each of which
              resides on a distinct membrane. Protein complexes from Arabidopsis will be
              purified and analyzed to determine the interactions among these elements and to
              identify novel interacting proteins. Together, these studies will illuminate
              the signaling pathways in which each of these Arabidopsis two-component
              signaling elements function and how they interact to control plant growth and
              development. The data from these studies will be deposited on a publicly
              accessible web page that is currently under construction at UNC
              (http://www.bio.unc.edu/research/two-component/). A link to this web site will
              be established on the TAIR database, and we will coordinate with TAIR to
              deposit data as appropriate. The knockout seeds will be made publicly available
              through deposition in the ABRC Stock Center at Ohio State. The monoclonals
              raised against the membrane marker proteins will be available for the cost of
              shipping through UNH and the cell lines will also be deposited with the
              American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).  In keeping with the goals of the
              2010 project, functional analysis of the two-component signaling elements will
              aid in our understanding of plants at the organismal, cellular, and
              evolutionary levels. The research will provide functional information on the
              role of Arabidopsis two-component signaling systems in plant growth and
              development.  The research will serve to define the subcellular location of the
              two-component signal transduction pathways, the interactions between the
              two-component signaling elements, and the downstream targets of the pathways. 
              The research should clarify how a signal transduction mechanism that arose in
              bacteria has been adapted to plant signal transduction. These studies should
              uncover the functions of several gene families in Arabidopsis.  The proteins
              encoded by these gene families are predicted to interact and thus our studies
              should aid in the development of a paradigm for signaling specificity among
              interacting members of large gene families.  In addition, tools will be
              developed that will be generally applicable in defining the subcellular
              location of proteins in Arabidopsis.
