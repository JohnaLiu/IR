Abstract    :
              0114624 Shannon  Description:  This award supports a collaborative research
              project between Dr. Curtis Shannon, Department of Chemistry, Auburn University,
              Auburn, Alabama and Dr. Unit Demir, Department of Chemistry, Ataturk
              University, Erzurum, Turkey.  These investigators plan to study fundamental
              aspects of thin film structure and growth kinetics in materials grown by
              electrochemical atomic layer epitaxy (EC-ALE).  This is a room temperature
              technique for materials growth that can be used to produce high quality,
              epitaxially oriented polycrystalline deposits in a layer-by-layer fashion on a
              wide variety of conducting substrates. They will specifically use in their
              studies two goals for better understanding of the growth mechanism.  These are
              scanning probe microscopy studies of thin film structure and chronoamperometric
              studies of the rate of deposition processes during the EC-ALE growth
              cycle.  Scope:  This award will allow a US scientist and a Turkish scientist
              with complementary expertise to pool their resources in a mutually beneficial
              study.  Dr. Shannon is an established researcher in the electrosynthesis of
              thin film materials and their characterization by scanning probe techniques. 
              Dr. Demir is a young scientist with expertise in the kinetics of
              electrodeposition. The project will involve a US graduate student from Auburn
              University who will work with the foreign collaborating scientist.
