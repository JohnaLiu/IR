Abstract    :
              MIT's Department of Materials Science and Engineering establishes a Summer
              Institute in Materials Science and Materials Culture.  The purpose of the
              Summer Institute is to assist professors at liberal arts colleges in
              introducing materials science and engineering to their undergraduate curricula.
               The Summer Institute brings together MIT faculty, faculty from undergraduate
              liberal art institutions, and MIT graduate students in a modular, case study
              format that combines materials science and engineering with social science and
              humanities fields.  The design of the modules considers both the physical
              properties and cultural dimensions of materials.  Each module integrates
              laboratory experiences in the processing and the chemical and microstructural
              analysis of the material under consideration.  By teaching educators from
              liberal arts institutions, the project brings the perspectives and
              methodologies of materials science and engineering to a much broader and
              diverse audience than is usually present at engineering institutions, thus
              broadening the educational base for materials science and engineering.
