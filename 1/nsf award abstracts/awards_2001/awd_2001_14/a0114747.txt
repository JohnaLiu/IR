Abstract    :
              The LSAMP Pacific Alliance proposes to initiate a collaborative that will effect
              a systemic change in the hiring patterns of Alaskan Natives, Native Americans,
              and Pacific Rim Islanders in the fields of SMET. The goals would be achieved by
              increasing the number of individuals who can access SMET careers through the
              increased recruitment, retention and placement within partner communities. The
              specific target is to double the number of Indigenous American students
              graduating annually, with 50% going on to graduate school.
