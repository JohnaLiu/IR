Abstract    :
              This dissertation project is a multi-sited ethnographic analysis of the
              interplay of Catholic social ethics and technological advances in healthcare
              science at the fourth largest US hospital system. This 48-facility corporation
              is the flagship of Catholic healthcare but serves diverse California
              constituencies. This project investigates situations where developments in
              medical science and technology result in conflicting ethics and value systems
              between Catholic hospitals and the communities they care for. It seeks to
              understand how these values are articulated and how conflicting demands are
              negotiated between people and between organizational structures. This research
              will focus on how values affect actual behavior within institutions and how
              policy is developed to respond to conflicting values systems. Ethnographic
              research methods in this 15 month project include: 1) daily participant
              observation in meetings and hospital practice, 2) modified life history
              interviews with 10-15 informants involved in ethics issues and policy design,
              3) review and analysis of documents produced by the hospital system since 1997.
              Field sites reflect an explicit effort to work in facilities where new
              technologies challenge operative value systems, as in secular hospitals now
              affiliated with the Catholic system. This research will contribute to the study
              of science and religious pluralism, particularly how ethics and social values
              affect group behavior. The results will be of interest to bioethicists,
              theologians, healthcare service providers and policy makers, and community
              groups working with faith-based organizations.
