Sympatric speciation, in which a single population
              undergoes an evolutionary split into two co-occurring species, has been a
              source of controversy for 50 years. Many biologists believe species split only
              when populations are geographically divided. Skepticism about sympatric
              speciation is due to theoretical criticisms and the paucity of unambiguous
              examples. The idea has regained acceptance lately, due to accumulating
              empirical examples and supportive theoretical analyses. However, the theory
              relies on population dynamics that have never been soundly demonstrated in
              nature. The hypothesis is that competition among individuals in a population is
              strongest among common phenotypes, weakest for rare phenotypes, so that the
              average individual does poorly while unusual individuals escape competition and
              do relatively well.  

The investigators will use observational surveys to
              test whether such disruptive selection occurs naturally in populations of
              freshwater stickleback fish. They will also conduct experimental population
              density manipulations to test whether competition is the underlying cause. This
              research will test the assumptions underlying recent advances in speciation
              theory. It is also relevant to understanding how individuals in a population
              subdivide their resources, which affects both population dynamics, and how an
              invading species adapts to a new environment.
