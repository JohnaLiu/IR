Abstract    :
              The George V Coast (140 - 150 degrees E) is an understudied coastal region of
              Antarctica. This Small Grant for Exploratory Research adds a biological
              component to a project focusing on the shelf and bottom water formation along
              the coast. This research will determine basic information on the biological
              oceanography of the region and in particular, how its productivity is related
              to the local hydrographic fields. The specific goals are 1) to map the
              chlorophyll a distribution and the photosynthetic capacity of the phytoplankton
              of the regions, 2) to characterize the phytoplankton and microzooplankton
              populations in the region by direct microscopic analysis, and 3) to measure
              nitrate and silicate levels in the various water masses. These goals will
              provide information on to what extent biological production relates to regional
              water masses, on the biological nature of the local production and the
              association between function groups of plankon and the water masses of the
              region, and on the interaction between phytoplankton growth and nutrient
              draw-down. Results from the study can be used as the basis for more extensive
              hypotheses about the biological production and flux in the region and are
              likely to catalyze further research in the understudied Southern Ocean.
