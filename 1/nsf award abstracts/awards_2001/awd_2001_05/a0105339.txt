The Himalaya has received intensive study as if is an active
              continent - continent collision, and many parameters such as amount of
              shortening, rates and subducted material measured in the Himalaya have been
              used in developing general models for continent - continent collisions.  Recent
              results indicate that some of the shortening in the Himalaya may be due to an
              older event.  This project aims to investigate this pre-Himalayan deformation
              and separate it from the tertiary collision of India with Asia, generally
              considered to be the Himalayan orogen.  Results are expected to refine or
              correct important aspects of the deformation history of this important system
              that will have widespread application.
