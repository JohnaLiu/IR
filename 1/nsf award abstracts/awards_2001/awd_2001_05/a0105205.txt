Abstract    :
              This project explores the potential of various Lewis-acid catalyzed reactions to
              be promoted and rendered catalytic and/or asymmetric by the introduction of
              chiral Lewis bases.  The types of reactions that this scheme encompasses is
              extensive, with immediate objectives including asymmetric aldehyde aldol
              reactions and aldehyde allylation reactions.  Mechanistic investigations
              supporting the methodological studies include kinetic studies relying upon
              supercritical fluid chromatography and rapid-injection NMR.

With this Award,
              the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support of the
              research and educational activities of Professor Scott E. Denmark of the
              University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  Professor Denmark conducts
              fundamental research into synthetic and mechanistic aspects of reactions
              designed to prepare small molecules controlling the stereochemistry of several
              centers of asymmetry in a simultaneous fashion.  In addition, doctoral students
              of chemistry gain invaluable knowledge in the conception and conduct of modern
              organic chemistry.
