In this study the
              kinetics and mechanisms of reactions of chlorinated hydrocarbon radicals is
              studied over wide ranges of temperature and pressure using the laser
              photolysis/ photoionization mass spectrometry (LP/PIMS) technique. Particular
              systems investigated include (1) reactions of chlorinated radicals (CH2, Cl,
              CHCl2, CCl3) with methyl (CH3); (2) reactions of chlorinated methyl radicals
              with molecular oxygen (O2) at high temperatures; and (3) the unimolecular
              decompositions of C2Cl3 and delocalized chlorinated hydrocarbon radicals, as
              well as their reactions with O2, oxygen atoms, and chlorine (Cl2). Experimental
              kinetic results are analysis using transition-state theory, RRKM, and Master
              Equation approaches.

The information generated in this effort will lead to
              improved models of combustion of chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs). This should
              enable more efficient incineration of CHC waste and reduction of hazardous
              emissions.
