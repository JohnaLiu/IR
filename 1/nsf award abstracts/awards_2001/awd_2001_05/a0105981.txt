Techniques and applications of (U-Th)/He dating have
              grown rapidly in the last several years due to the low closure temperature and
              relatively high analytical precision of this newly revitalized chronometer.
              This proposal seeks funds to continue ongoing, broad efforts at Caltech to
              improve and expand methods of (U-Th)/He dating. In the case of apatite
              thermochronometry, several important questions remain to be investigated to
              assure confidence and reliability of the method. In addition, preliminary work
              indicates that other minerals may also be of use for (U-Th)/He dating and may
              provide new ways to address important geologic problems. These are the major
              issues to be explored by the proposed work. More specifically, the proposal
              objectives are 1) development and implementation of new experimental techniques
              for assessing He diffusion coefficients with the goal of establishing a robust
              understanding of what factors ultimately control He diffusion; 2) development
              of an understanding of why occasional apatite samples yield erratic He ages,
              and testing of new analytical methods by which to circumvent these problems; 3)
              exploration of the origin and significance of apatite grain-to-grain age
              heterogeneity using the newly developed laser heating technique; 4) development
              and initial application of methods for dating of extremely young volcanic
              samples (10's of kyr to few Myr), and in particular assessment of the
              consequences of  U-series disequilibrium, and 5) exploration of the use of
              (U-Th)/He techniques for dating of Fe and Mn oxides produced in weathering
              horizons.
