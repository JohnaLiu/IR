The way a plant grows roots in response to soil nutrients and
              the roots of other plants has important consequences with respect to its
              fitness (i.e., growth, survivorship, and reproduction), competition among
              plants, and plant community organization.   The proposed research models and
              tests how root allocation can provide an indicator of competitive ability in
              different species.  A three-pot design with two split-root plants provides each
              plant with the choice of proliferating roots in an exclusive space versus a
              shared space.  Differences in competitive abilities between pairs of plants
              should manifest in predictably different strategies for allocating roots to the
              exclusive and shared pots.  Garden plot experiments will then verify that the
              plant's rooting strategies predict outcomes of competition.  The entire
              approach aims to show that plants may be much more animal-like in their
              behavior than previously thought.
