Seasonal changes affect the foraging strategies of
              animals. Previous experiments demonstrated that colonies of the ant Pheidole
              ceres change their foraging behavior seasonally. When presented with both
              sugars and proteins, the ants increased their intake of protein when they had
              more larvae in the colony. In this proposed study, two hypotheses to explain
              that increase will be examined. First, the way in which the workers assess the
              needs of the larvae will be explored. Colonies will be split into four
              subunits, each given a different diet, and then the brood will be exchanged
              between them; offering choices between proteins and sugars throughout the
              experiment will show how the treatments affect the ants' foraging decisions.
              Second, the types of nutrients stored by ants will be assessed by measuring
              total protein and total fat found in individual ants collected throughout the
              year. Finally, the ants' foraging behavior will be compared to the types of
              nutrients they are storing. Together, these experiments will provide insight to
              how ant colonies meet nutritional demands.
