Abstract:
This project is aimed at developing data compression techniques
              for
substantially reducing the data memory footprint of memory
              intensive
applications. We will study the behavior of a wide range of
              applications
to identify characteristics of data held in data structures by
              these
programs that can be exploited in carrying out data compression.
              We
will develop a suite of data compression transformations that will
              be
implemented by the compiler. Our goal is to develop data
              transformations
that can be applied to partially compressible data structures,
              that is,
data structures in which all the data is not compressible. This
              approach
will not only result in transformations that are widely applicable,
              but
also lead to techniques for applying them that are efficient. In
              particular,
instead of relying on complex compile-time analysis for proving
              their
applicability, we will be able to use simple value profiling
              techniques
to identify data structures that are mostly compressible and then
              apply
the transformations to them.  We will develop data compression
              extensions
(DCX) to a RISC-style instruction set for efficiently
              manipulating
compressed data. In addition, we will also address other low
              level code
generation issues, such as impact of transformations on register
              pressure
and instruction cache behavior, which can have a significant impact
              on
performance.
