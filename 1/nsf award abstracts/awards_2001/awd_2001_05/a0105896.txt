Synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) is a
              relatively new tool for monitoring deformations of the surface of the earth
              associated with earthquakes, volcanoes, and groundwater subsidence.  Sparse
              networks of GPS receivers provide accurate ground motions over a limited number
              of points while the space-based InSAR technique provides higher spatial
              resolution (~100 m) and global access but poor temporal resolution.  Suitable
              civilian SAR satellites have been flown by the European Space Agency (ERS-1 and
              ERS-2) as well as by the Japanese Space agency (JERS-1 and ALOS - 2003 launch
              date).  These data are largely unexplored and are of enormous value for
              assessing the earthquake risk in Southern California.  The investigators will
              use these data to monitor co-seismic, post-seismic, and inter-seismic crustal
              deformation.  Published models of the earthquake cycle predict that much of the
              diagnostic crustal strain occurs within 10 km of the fault zone and thus it
              will not be observed by the relatively coarse distribution of GPS monuments (>
              10 km spacing).  The proposed tasks include:  
development of high-resolution
              topographic models for accurate removal of topographic phase from change
              interferograms; 
estimation of the depth distribution of slip on the 1999
              Hector Mine rupture; 
examination of post-seismic slip at the Landers and
              Hector Mine ruptures in relation to the earthquake cycle models; 
monitoring
              creep rate and creep depth along major faults in Southern California;
              
development of a boundary-element model of the Southern California fault
              system; 
and preparation for L-band SAR data to be collected by the Japanese
              ALOS mission.
