Abstract:

This research is
              motivated by fundamental questions in Robotics and
Computer Graphics, such as
              planning the motion of a robot arm, detecting
collisions and computing
              visibilities. It seeks efficient algorithmic
solutions by investigating the
              underlying computational structures with
novel mathematical tools and it has a
              substantial potential to lead to
applications in understanding the nature of
              the protein folding process in
biology.

The investigator is undertaking a
              systematic plan of research aimed at
furthering the understanding of how the
              underlying oriented matroid
structure of points and lines affects properties
              of a variety of partially
embedded combinatorial structures such as pseudo
              triangulations and
visibility graphs. The focus is on combinatorial
              (enumeration, generation,
characterization) and algorithmic questions, the
              underlying framework is
geometric (dimensions 2 and 3), and the techniques
              involved come from
matroid and oriented matroid theory, rigidity theory,
              combinatorial
topology, computational algebraic geometry and graph
              embeddings.
