Abstract    :
              This project will utilize a multi-fluid global simulation of the magnetosphere
              to study several important questions concerning the interaction of the
              magnetosphere with the ionosphere and with the plasma sphere.  It will examine
              how changes in ionospheric conductance modifies the cross-polar cap electric
              potential drop, the effects of ionospheric mass loading on the evolution of the
              magnetosphere and how the introduction of heavy ionospheric ions affects the
              reconnection process in the magnetotail.
