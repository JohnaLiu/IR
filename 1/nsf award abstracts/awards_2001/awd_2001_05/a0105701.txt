Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to establish methods for theoretical 
study
              in an important area of theoretical computer science, which is
the analysis of
              randomized algorithms. The main focus is on problems
that either can be
              modeled by Markov chains or can be analyzed using
the Markov chain
              approach.

This project concentrates on three main topics: (1) general
              analysis
of discrete-time Markov chains and the Monte Carlo Markov
              Chain
method, (2) analysis of Markov chains for generating
              random
permutations, and (3) resource allocation problems in
              distributed
systems.

In the area of general analysis of Markov chains the
              goal of the
research is to develop new tools for the analysis of mixing times
              of
Markov chains. An important part of this study is to
              investigate
relationships between various known methods of the analysis of
              mixing
times of Markov chains.

In the investigations of Markov chains for
              generating random
permutations the main focus is on so called random
              switching
networks. These networks model behavior of many Markov chains
              that
are sought in applications in cryptography.

In the area of resource
              allocation problems in distributed systems,
the research focuses mostly on
              resource allocation problems in
networks, in which the cost of the allocation
              depend on the routing
properties of the input network as well as on the
              contention
resolution protocols applied to the system.
