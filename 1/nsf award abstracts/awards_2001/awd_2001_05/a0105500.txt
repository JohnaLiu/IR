This proposal requests funds to support an ion probe
              study of existing 10 kbar mantle-melting run products which the P.I. proposes
              to pursue while at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution during his sabbatical
              in Fall, 2001.  These run products represent 5+ years of NSF-funded work by the
              P.I. and two recent Ph.D. graduates. Ten peridotitic starting materials, each
              constructed by recombining hand-picked and acid-washed mineral separates in
              differing modes, were investigated. Five of these utilized minerals from a
              fertile lherzolite xenolith from Kilbourne Hole while the other five utilized
              minerals from a compositionally intermediate lherzolite sample from Mt. Noorat,
              S.E. Australia. In all, 54 glass- and olivine-bearing run products are
              available, 36 with cpx, 41 with opx, and 47 with spinel.  Calculated melt
              fractions range from 1-48 wt. %; 22 contain less than 5 wt% melt.
All
              experiments employed a variation of the diamond aggregate technique (e.g.,
              Hirose and Kushiro, 1993; Baker and Stolper, 1994) in which a layer of 70-100
              micron diameter vitreous carbon spheres was substituted in lieu of powdered
              diamond, to provide a melt sink in which some melt could be isolated from the
              residual crystals, thereby preventing its quench modification upon termination
              of the experiments. Major element mineral and glass data for all starting
              materials vary in a systematic and sensible manner with increasing temperature
              and this, combined with run durations of 2-10 days, supports a close approach
              to equilibrium in the experiments.
The primary goals of the proposed work will
              be to measure the distribution coefficients between melt and cpx and opx for
              REE, Ti, V, Cr, Sr, Y, and Sr (Be, B, Rb, Nb, and Ba will also be attempted but
              will probably be too low in the pyroxenes), and to analyze the water contents
              of these nominally anhydrous run products. To my knowledge, these will be the
              first such data germane to mantle melting derived from experiments on
              peridotitic, as opposed to basaltic, bulk compositions. Earlier work in
              basaltic systems has revealed complex compositional dependencies of
              pyroxene/melt Ds demonstrating that the use of single-valued Ds in modeling
              studies is inappropriate. Our major element data greatly expand the composition
              space covered by experiment and will allow extension and better definition of
              these dependencies, thus improving predictive models. We also have 17
              cpx-bearing run products with less than 5% melt and some of these melts have
              the elevated Na2O and SiO2 contents that Baker et. al. (1995) first noted
              characterize very near-solidus mantle melts. Given the likely importance of
              fractional melting in the mid-ocean ridge environment, determination of the
              partitioning behavior of key trace elements between these "exotic" melts and
              mantle pyroxenes will be critical
