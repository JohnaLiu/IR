Abstract    :
              Essentially all present-day traveltime tomographic inversions ignore diffractive
              wavefront healing, and fail to account for the ability of a finite-frequency
              seismic wave to "feel" 3D structure off of the unperturbed spherical-earth ray.
               We used the support of NSF Grant EAR-9725496 to develop 3D banana-doughnut
              traveltime sensitivity kernels, which correctly account for all such finite
              frequency effects.  We intend to continue these investigations under Grant
              EAR-0105387, extending the theory to treat near-grazing and near-critical waves
              that are not adequately modeled by the present formulation, and using our 3D
              sensitivity kernels to invert the extensive global cross correlation traveltime
              dataset collected over the past decade by Professor Guy Masters and his
              collaborators at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  We shall also
              develop and apply 2D variations in the phase velocity, 2D kernels that express
              the sensitivity of a measured body-wave traveltime to topography on the
              core-mantle boundary or the 410 km or 660 km discontinuities, 3D sensitivity
              kernels for differential traveltime measurements made using seismic arrays, and
              2D and 3D sensitivity kernels for other seismic observables, including arrival
              angles and amplitudes of both body and surface waves.  Finally, we shall
              conduct an extensive series of numerical validation and synthetic inversion
              studies, in both pseudo-random media and realistic whole-mantle models, in
              order to ascertain the degree of mantle roughness needed to give rise to
              significant diffraction effects upon long-period seismic traveltimes.
