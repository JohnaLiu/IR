Abstract    :
              The project is on the measurement of magnetic properties of nanocrystals of
              CoPt, FePt, and R2Fe17 (R=Rare earth) grown as films. The films are
              encapsulated in gaphite coatings to protect them from oxidation and
              environmental degradation. The graphite coating also increases the effective
              distance of neighboring nanocrystals, and causes the decrease of the
              particle-particle exchange interaction, which is an important issue in the
              ongoing development of films for high-density magnetic recording medium. The
              ordered phases of CoPt and FePt exhibit high magnetocrystalline anisotropy that
              results in a strong energy barrier against thermally activated switching of the
              magnetic moments for extremely small ferromagnetic nanocrystals. The presence
              of minute amount of carbon in R2Fe17 structure increases Fe-Fe exchange
              interaction. This causes the increase in the ferromagnetic transition
              temperature that makes the utilization of these materials as magnets over a
              wide range of temperature possible. The materials are fabricated at
              Northwestern University (Professor Vinayak P. Dravid and his research group)
              while this study is aimed at the characterization of their magnetic properties
              using magnetometry, Mossbauer spectroscopy and magnetic force microscopy at the
              undergraduate research institution (San Jose State).

The activities
              proposed here are fully compatible with the goals of NSF-RUI program in
              enhancing the research infrastructure of SJSU. Interaction with Northwestern
              University in areas of synthesis and structure is additional feature of the
              proposed research making the study of advanced materials possible at SJSU. SJSU
              is a diversified school with high percentage of minorities and women while the
              results will be very useful to disk drive technology.
