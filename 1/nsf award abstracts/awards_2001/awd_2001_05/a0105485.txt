Abstract    :
              The proposed research has as final objective advancing knowledge on disk arrays
              performance, as well as developing new disk array organizations and algorithms
              for improved performance and reliability.  The following specific areas will be
              investigated.   Mirored disks (RAID1) double the disk access bandwidth for
              reads, but even higher performance is possible through scheduling.  A
              combination of single disk scheduling methods adapted to mirrored disks and
              methods utilizing non-volatile storage to defer writes will be investigated. 
              RAID6 disk arrays tolerating two disk failures utilize two parity disks or one
              parity disk and one utilizing the Reed-Solomon code.  Two data layouts for the
              former case have been proposed.  The performance of these configurations will
              be compared with each other, as well as RAID5, while the system is operating in
              normal, degraded, and rebuild modes.   Active disks process data locally to
              disk, responding with final or filtrated data rather than raw data.  Techniques
              to process more sophisticated queries than those considered so far will be
              investigated.  Prioritized processing of disk requests allows background
              applications to make progress without significant impact on the performance  of
              higher priority applications.   We plan to investigate nonpreemptive as well as
              preemptive priorities in processing disk requests.
