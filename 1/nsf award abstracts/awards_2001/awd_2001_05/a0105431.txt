This grant to support theoretical research on strongly
              correlated electron systems is coordinated with a similar grant at DOE.  The
              topics to be studied include heavy fermions, related mixed valent phenomena,
              properties of manganites, and integrable one-dimensional models of correlated
              electrons and magnetism.
