"Monterey Workshop 2001-
              Engineering Automation for Software Intensive System Integration"

A 3-day
              workshop, to be held in Monterey, CA on June 19-21, is organized for the
              dissemination and integration of recent research results related to the
              production of reliable cost-effective software in heterogeneous environments. 
              A major goal of the workshop is to help the software engineering community
              focus on issues that are vital to improving the state of software engineering
              practice, including all topics related to supporting engineering automation of
              reliable, cost-effective, integrated, distributed software development
              processes.  The workshop activities aim to assess current research efforts in
              this area, identify results and directions that can increase the degree of
              automation, aid tool integration by building a common understanding, and
              increase the practical use of formal methods.
