Abstract    :
              This action is to support a field survey, in Easter Island and the Juan
              Fernandez Islands off Chile, of the 1946 Aleutian tsunami.

The April 1,1946
              Unimak Island, Alaskan tsunami remains a geophysical mystery:  It was generated
              by a relatively moderate earthquake, yet it produced the highest waves recorded
              in historical times in Hawaii, where it killed 159 people and caused
              considerably more damage than the nearby 1957 earthquake (a much larger seismic
              event), or even the great 1960 Chilean tsunami that was triggered by the
              largest earthquake ever measured.  Seismic information is scant, and the only
              realistic possibility of understanding this 1946 event appears to be
              hydrodynamic inversion from inundation data around the Pacific.

Criteria for
              the accuracy of hydrodynamic inversions are not well established, but it
              appears that the geographic distribution of data is at least as important, if
              not more so, than the number of data points.  Until recently, it was believed
              that the tsunami had little impact south of Hawaii.  However during a field
              survey of an tsunami in the island of Fatu Hiva in September 1999, the
              International Tsunami Research Team discovered large rocks that were reportedly
              moved inland in 1946, at about the time of the Aleutian tsunami.  Some of the
              rocks were found 300m inland.  In the summer of 2000, a joint US/France
              expedition was able to document these findings.  The team interviewed
              eyewitnesses and their accounts helped develop approximate inundation maps for
              the Marquesas from the April 1,1946 event.

This field survey of the Aleutian
              tsunami in Easter Island and the Juan Fernandez Islands off Chile is very
              timely, since the location of these islands allows the measurement of free
              field inundation data - assuming that eyewitnesses can be found.  During the
              Marquesas survey, the ITST interviewed about 40 eyewitnesses on 6 islands (and
              an additional 10 on 2 of the Society Islands), many quite elderly.  Apart from
              the advanced age of the expected eyewitnesses, there is another compelling
              reason for performing this survey: preliminary analysis suggests that a
              landslide was involved in the Aleutian tsunami.  If this is the case, then
              accurate hydrodynamic inversion is urgently needed to identify the landslide
              source.  Inundation maps for Hawaii are currently being re-evaluated, and
              inundation maps for the Pacific states of the US mainland are being developed
              for the first time.  Tsunamis from the Aleutians need to be carefully
              reassessed, particularly in view of the landslide trigger potential, so that
              the new evacuation maps are developed with the best available technology and
              field knowledge.
