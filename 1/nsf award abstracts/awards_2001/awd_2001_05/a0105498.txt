This research focuses on algorithms that work
with limited
              information. Each topic is motivated by an application
in on-line resource
              allocation in computer systems and is studied
using theoretical analysis as
              well as empirical evaluation.
The first topic is focuses on
designing
              protocols for power management.
The second topic  of this research addresses
              problems
that arise in scheduling and load balancing for multimedia
              servers.
The third topic focuses on the problem of balancing the use
              of
bandwidth and storage in caching continuous multi-media objects
for Web
              proxy servers.


For the power management topic, the question addressed is
              when to move
an idle  device to a lower power consumption state so as
              to
conserve power usage while minimizing the latency experienced by the
user.
               The investigator expands upon previous work on power management
              by
introducing the notion of latency and by studying systems with
              multiple
levels of power usage.  The work on multimedia scheduling and
              load
balancing focuses on two problems.  The first is scheduling
              transmission
of data that must be viewed continuously when clients have
              large
buffers that can store data transmitted ahead of time.
The second
              problem is to perform load balancing in assigning
tasks to servers when there
              are multiple resource requirements
that need to be balanced. For the topic of
              caching continuous
multi-media objects for Web proxy servers, the
              challenge
is that continuous data must be transmitted to the client in
              a
continuous sequential stream. To support the real time requirements
of
              streaming, web caches need to reserve bandwidth as well as space
for each
              request for a continuous data object.
This research investigates algorithms
              for balancing these
two resources.
