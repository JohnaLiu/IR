Abstract    :
              The research focuses on the design and implementation of a framework,
called
              the ADaptive Object RE-optimization (ADORE) system, to evaluate
the
              effectiveness of dynamic binary re-optimization, and to study the
interaction
              between architecture/micro-architecture and a dynamic
binary re-optimizer. The
              topics studied include: efficient profiling
techniques; runtime hot region
              selection and formation; light-weight
runtime optimizations; code patching and
              region linking techniques;
architectural and micro-architectural support for
              dynamic binary
optimization; and runtime specialization and value
              profiling.
The first implementation of the ADORE system will be based on
two
              different implementations of the IA-64 architecture, the
Itanium and the
              McKinley. The performance of application code
optimized for Itanium will be
              tested on McKinley using the
ADORE system.
