This U.S.-Argentina Program award will provide support for the
              Fifth Latin American workshop on magnetism and magnetic materials and their
              applications organized by Dr. Saul Oseroff of San Diego State University and
              Drs. Manuel Tovar and Maria Teresa Causa of Centro Atomico Bariloche.  This
              workshop will be held in San Carlos de Bariloche, Argentina, September 3-8,
              2001.
This activity will encourage new collaborations between researchers from
              the U.S., Latin America and Europe within different areas of magnetism, promote
              mechanisms for long term collaborations involving academia, industry and
              government, and identify new areas of research for joint collaborations.
