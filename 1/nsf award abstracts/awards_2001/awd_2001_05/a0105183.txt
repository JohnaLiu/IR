This Americas Program award will support Dr. Robert T.
              Walker of Michigan State University in collaboration with Marcellus Caldas and
              Joaquin Bento de Souza Ferreira, both of the University of Sao Paulo.  The
              purpose of this proposal is to organize a social science workshop to address
              our collective understanding of the processes driving tropical deforestation,
              and to identify potential policy responses. Three subjects will be addressed:
              (1) research methodology, (2) the drivers of deforestation, (3) and policy
              responses.

The objective of the conference is to bring together researchers
              of various disciplines, working at different geographical levels in the
              Brazilian Amazon, to facilitate the integration of their work into more
              universal theories about the social dimensions of tropical deforestation.  The
              workshop by its very structure will facilitate international collaboration on
              key research questions and will establish generational continuity in the social
              science research community studying the Amazon.
