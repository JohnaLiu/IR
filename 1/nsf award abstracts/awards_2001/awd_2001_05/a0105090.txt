The Effects of Increasing Atmospheric CO2 on Plant Defense
              Against Pathogens

	When grown under elevated carbon dioxide, plant leaves
              typically contain lower concentrations of nitrogen.  Because plant defenses
              against herbivores and pathogens are nitrogen-intensive, rising atmospheric CO2
              may make it more difficult for plants to mount an effective defense against
              pathogens, particularly if they are required to defend themselves against an
              herbivore at the same time.
I will expose turnip grown under current and twice
              current levels of CO2 to a bacterial pathogen, and measure levels of both
              salicylic acid (a signal molecule in pathogen response) and anti-pathogen
              proteins.  I will also simultaneously expose a subset of plants to simulated
              herbivory, and measure levels of protease inhibitors (a nitrogen-rich
              anti-herbivore defense).  Together, these experiments will allow me to
              determine whether there is a trade-off between defense against pathogens and
              against herbivores, and whether this trade-off will become more severe as
              atmospheric CO2 continues to rise.
