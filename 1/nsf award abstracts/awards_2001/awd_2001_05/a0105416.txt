Professor A.M.Yaglom,
              co-author with Professor A.S. Monin of the classic book on turbulence
              "Statistical Fluid Mechanics" that was published in Russia in 1965-66 and in
              English by M.I.T. Press in 1971-5, is current working on the second edition of
              the book.  He plans to update the original book to "present a panoramic view of
              turbulence research at the end of the 20th century".  The work on the early
              parts of the book was supported by Stanford/Ames Center for Turbulence
              Research, by US Army Research Laboratory, Silver Spring, MD, and by a private
              Foundation in Massachusetts.  All the funding ran out in October of 2000.  The
              purpose of this proposal is to secure funding for the continuation of this
              project at MIT where Professor Yaglom is a Fellow.
