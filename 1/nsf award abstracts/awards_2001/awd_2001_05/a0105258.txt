Abstract    :
              This is a US-Polish collaborative research project that will support the
              participation of Polish researchers in the PP2PP experiment at RHIC.  The
              principal investigator is Dr. Michael Rijssenbeek from SUNY at Stony Brook. 
              His Polish collaborators are Professor Andrzej Sandacz from the Institute for
              Nuclear Studies in Warsaw and Drs. Janusz Chwastowski and Bogdan Pawlik from
              the Institute of Nuclear Physics in Krakow.

The SUNY Stony Brook group has
              been responsible for PP2PP simulations.  This activity will now be taken over
              by the Polish group.  In order for this to happen this project will provide
              support for the necessary consulting and transfer of software responsibilities.
               This project will also facilitate and integrate collaborative research in
              preparation of the data run, during data-taking, and in the data analysis
              phase.

This project in nuclear physics research fulfills the program
              objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern
              Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong
              mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and
              mutuality of benefit.
