Abstract    :
              This award will support international travel of younger US cognitive scientists
              to enable them to participate in the full scientific program of the 23rd Annual
              Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society, taking place August 1-4, 2001 in
              Edinburgh, Scotland, the first such meeting outside of North America.  The
              participation of these younger (Ph.D. within the last six years) scientists,
              all of whose research is on topics within the purview of NSF, will allow them
              to forge connections with researchers in the international community.  Thus,
              not only will collaborations be born that could not start in other fashions,
              but also the international visibility of these young US scientists will be
              enhanced.
