This award will support the activities of a group of
              investigators to
study the scientific opportunities, as well as facility
              features and
requirements, of a possible US underground laboratory.  Recent
              meetings and workshops have indicated considerable enthusiasm for such a
              possibility.  A steering committee has been formed that will direct these
              activities and facilitate activity involvement.
