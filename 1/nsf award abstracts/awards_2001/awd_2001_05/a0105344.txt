Title: Rupture propagation and
              arrest in geometrically complex fault systems: Bends, stepovers, and damaged
              border zones

Our project seeks to understand mechanical
              principles controlling earthquake rupture propagation and arrest in
              geometrically complex fault systems.  As part of that we are devising numerical
              methodology to model dynamic rupture with inclusion of non-planarity of fault
              surfaces, step-overs and branches in fault networks, activation of smaller
              faults or fractures in the region bordering a main fault zone, and simultaneous
              activation of competitive rupture paths.  In general the rupture path cannot be
              specified a priori but, rather, must be dynamically self-chosen among available
              fault segments of the network.  

Geological, geodetic and seismological
              observations are used to constrain and test developing ideas on how rupture
              geometry and prevailing stress state, including principal stress orientations,
              control whether a rupture starts along a branching fault structure, whether it
              continues for long distances along the branch, how intermittent is the rupture
              propagation, etc.  Those observational cases include thrust (San Fernando 1971,
              Kettleman Hills 1985) and strike slip (Imperial Valley 1979, Landers 1992,
              Hector Mine 1999) events in which branching and/or activation of off-fault
              activity seem to be involved.  Other examples are under study throughout the
              world for major fault systems, including the North Anatolian system, the Izmit
              1999 sequence along it, and its possible future continuation near
              Istanbul.

The studies include consideration of how energy is dissipated in
              dynamic rupture, and what are characteristics of the enriched high frequency
              seismic radiation.
