Abstract    :
              he models used in inductive inference have their
roots in the models used by
              the philosophers of
science who were discussing the scientific method.
The
              goal there, and in prior work in learning theory,
was to come up with an
              explanation of the phenomenon
under consideration.
However, scientists rarely
              work directly for the grand goal
of a complete explanation.
The more modest
              goal of finding features and
facts about the observed data is pursued.
A
              variety of types of algorithms that could be construed as
discovering their
              final result will be investigated.
We propose to consider computations that
              discover rather than compute
their intended result.
A logic of discovery will
              be developed and investigated.
This study is particularly relevant to
              contemporary
science as automated data generation techniques
produce
              sufficient volumes of data to
overwhelm the analysis abilities of humans.
The
              goal of our work is to illuminate
precisely what can and cannot be
              accomplished
by automatic data analysis algorithms.
Such algorithms are used
              in data mining and
text analysis for world wide web search engines.
