Abstract    :
              Physiological and molecular studies of the diageotropica (dgt) mutant of tomato
              have demonstrated that plants have a single gene that is involved in regulating
               many different aspects of growth, development, and responses to environment,
              including lateral root initiation, stem growth, leaf and vascular tissue
              differentiation, fruit development, and responses to gravity and light.  All of
              these processes are controlled by the plant hormone auxin and dgt mutant plants
              exhibit reduced sensitivity to auxin.  This project will complete the map-based
              cloning of the Dgt gene and begin characterization of it's function.  Using
              similarities with the Arabidopsis genome that was recently completely
              sequenced, we have used molecular markers to pinpoint the location of the Dgt
              gene to a single 15 Kb region of DNA.  We plan to completely sequence this
              region of the genome and use comparisons between normal and mutant genes as
              well as repair of mutant plants with the intact gene to confirm the identity of
              the Dgt gene.  Characterization of the DGT gene product following sequencing
              will have a large impact on our understanding of the interaction of other
              hormones with auxin in regulating environmental and developmental responses. 
              In addition, this research will explore the potential for the use of similar
              DNA regions between Arabidopsis and tomato to clone genes and provide
              validation for using the information emerging from the Arabidopsis genome
              project for studies of other plant species.
