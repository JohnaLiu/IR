Abstract    :
              Rex Skodje of the University of Colorado is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to develop and apply new theoretical techniques
              to achieve a better understanding of chemical processes.  This research has
              several components.  First, there will be a study of short-lived intermediates
              in chemical reactions using quantum scattering theory and wavepacket dynamics. 
              Second, a new technique for simplifying large systems of kinetics equations
              will be developed and applied to large chemical models.  Finally, the kinetics
              of thin films will be studied with the aim of understanding aggregation in thin
              films.  The last two topics are strongly synergistic.

A wide variety of
              chemical problems, such as combustion, atmospheric chemistry, and surface
              reactions, are modeled using complex networks of nonlinear kinetic equations. 
              Unfortunately, most realistic models involve many species, reactions, and time
              scales, which can hinder numerical treatment as well as meaningful physical
              analysis.  The goal of this research is kinetic simplification that promises to
              impact many fields of science and engineering.
