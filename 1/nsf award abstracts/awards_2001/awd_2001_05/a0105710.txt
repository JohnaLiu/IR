Abstract    :
              A thorough investigation of componene-oriented programming languages
is
              undertaken that entails (a) designing a component-oriented language,
(b)
              implementing it efficiently on modern computer architectures, and
(c) ensuring
              its applicability through case studies.
Design of the new language entails
              evaluating the suitability of
existing programming-language concepts for
              component-oriented
programming, specifying and evaluating new
              programming-language
features, and integrating the new and the old into a
              coherent new
language. Implementation involves assessing existing
              compiler
technology, proposing, building, and evaluating new
              compiler
mechanisms, and merging them into an efficient compiler and
              runtime
system. Finally, to ensure the language's applicability, a variety
              of
case studies are designed and implemented and the resulting
              systems
compared to more traditional solutions.
