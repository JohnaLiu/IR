Abstract    :
              This project addresses the challenges of successfully deploying large-scale
              parallel I/O servers to meet the demands of modern data-intensive applications
              multimedia retrieval, We and database servers, visualization and graphics, and
              spatial and temporal databases.  The goals are to develop scheduling and
              resource management algorithms for parallel I/O systems, and increase our
              understanding of the complex underlying resource tradeoffs.  These include
              basic scheduling issues dealing with parallel I/O, including those related to
              prefetching and caching, on -line scheduling, fair servicing of multiple users
              and deadline-constrained real-time parallel I/O.  Secondly the algorithms
              designed in this research will be directly applied to areas like multimedia
              systems, including variable-bit rate (VBR) video retrieval, and Web, database
              and application servers dealing with large numbers of concurrent, interacting
              I/Os.
