New, powerful ME-coefficient measurement techniques are
              used to study the effects of strain and dislocations in epitaxial magnetic
              nano-dots. The effects of limited lateral dimensions on strain relief and on ME
              effects are examined by using interferometric lithography to make
              highly-regular patterned arrays of magnetic dots and ovals having lateral
              feature sizes down to 25 nm and thickness from 2 to 20 nm. The program focuses
              on epitaxial Ni80 Fe20 and cobalt films on Cu-buffered Si (001), materials
              important for many magnetic thin film applications. The characterization of the
              film and dot arrays makes use of (a) synchrotron x-ray diffraction at BNL to
              determine strain, (b) torque magnetometry to characterize magnetic anisotropy,
              (c) vibrating sample magnetometry to determine saturation magnetization and
              Curie temperature, (d) differential capacitance measurements of first-order and
              second-order ME coupling coefficients, as well as (e) UHV and cryogenic
              magnetic force microscopy (in collaboration with the University of Basal), and
              scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. Strain and ME coupling
              coefficient measurements on arrays at these small dimensions will provide
              important information for reliable processing of magnetic thin film devices.
              Further, the magnetic dots will mimic the behavior of grains in polycrystalline
              materials where grain boundaries provide some relief of intra-grain epitaxial
              misfit strain.

This study has excellent potential for advances in
              science with relevance to new technology in spintronics as well as magnetic
              random access memories.
