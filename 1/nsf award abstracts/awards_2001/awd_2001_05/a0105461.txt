Abstract    :
              High latitudes are recognized as climatically sensitive and poorly understood
              components of the Earth's climate system. The transport of heat and moisture in
              the atmosphere constitutes the primary link between the Arctic and the global
              circulation system, yet owing to the dearth of conventional data in the central
              Arctic, little is known about the quantities, pathways, and interactions of
              energy and moisture after they enter the region. New data sets offer an
              exciting opportunity to observe the Arctic climate by providing measurements of
              atmospheric and surface quantities at (100-km)2 spatial resolution for two
              decades. This project will exploit observations from unique and recently
              available satellite-derived products to evaluate a new method to compute
              atmospheric heating caused by the convergence of horizontally transported
              sensible heat and moisture. Preliminary calculations suggest that these
              quantities have, indeed, changed significantly during the 20-year record of
              observations, with varying magnitudes and signs in different regions of the
              Arctic.
