Abstract    :
              Diana Lane, University of Illinois, Chicago.  Ecosystem restoration has become a
              widespread activity in recent years. Little is known, however, about the
              success of restoration projects in restoring soil quality. The objectives of
              the research are 1) to characterize changes in soil nutrients as restoration
              proceeds over time, and 2) to determine the mechanisms that control such
              changes. The investigators will conduct field studies and experiments across a
              unique 25-year chronosequence of tallgrass prairie restoration sites that were
              created on former agricultural land. An important aspect of this research is to
              determine whether the temporal and spatial variability of soil resources
              increase following restoration. Variability in soil resources is characteristic
              of natural systems but may decrease when soils are used for agriculture.
              Results from this study will improve understanding of the functional
              consequences of restoration. In addition, these results will have broader
              implications for understanding the development of plant-soil feedbacks
              following disturbance.
