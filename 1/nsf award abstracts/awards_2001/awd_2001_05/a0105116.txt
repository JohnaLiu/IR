Unlike humans, plant species often have more than two sets
              of chromosomes.  These polyploid plants, 30 to 70% of all plant species, are
              usually unable to mate with diploid individuals with two sets of chromosomes,
              and so they are considered different species.  When a polyploid plant
              originates from diploid progenitors, how does it succeed, if the surrounding
              plants interfere with reproduction?  One possibility is that the two types of
              plants have different habitat requirements.  If so, their spatial separation
              may prevent reproductive interference.  This project will examine whether the
              plant species, Ranunculus adoneus, with 16 or 32 chromosomes have different
              requirements for their survival, growth, and reproduction.  Populations with
              different chromosome counts grow in separate places in the Colorado Rockies. 
              This experiment will monitor survival and growth of seedlings transplanted
              between locations.  Reproductive interference will be demonstrated if adding
              pollen from the other plant type reduces the number of seeds
              produced.

Understanding the forces generating and maintaining biological
              diversity is one of the fundamental goals of biology.  Polyploid speciation has
              been an important process leading to new plant species, but is not well
              understood.  This study asks how new plant species originate, and so seeks to
              understand a major source of plant diversity.
