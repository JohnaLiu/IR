The researchers are studying the annual vs. perennial habit
              as alternative strategies for persistence in variable environments in a group
              of related plants native to the arid western United States.  They will be using
              DNA sequence data to infer the ancestor-descendant relationships in the Section
              Anogra of the genus Oenothera (Onagraceae).  They will test the association of
              the annual habit with aridity in the context of this hypothesis of
              relationships.  In addition, they will use demographic studies of an annual
              species and a closely related perennial species to test for patterns of
              survival and fecundity predicted to favor the annual vs. perennial habit.  The
              combination of large-scale (phylogenetic) and small-scale (demographic)
              comparative studies will allow the researchers to examine both the pattern of
              evolutionary change and specific mechanisms driving this change.

It has long
              been suggested that the transition from the perennial to annual habit is an
              important pathway of diversification and adaptation in arid lands.  In this
              study of the selective forces driving changes in habit, the researchers will
              further the understanding of the drivers of biotic diversity in arid lands, and
              the means by which plants persist in variable environments in general.
