Title:	Dissertation
              Research:  Ecotone Dynamics and Landscape Response to Climate
              Change

Attempts to predict ecological response to global climate change must
              start with a comprehensive understanding of factors influencing current spatial
              patterns of vegetation.  The proposed research examines the relationship
              between patterns of vegetation in old-growth forest and environmental factors
              likely to change under scenarios of global warming. Previous analyses have
              shown the need for better landscape-level estimates of fundamental
              environmental properties. Consequently, fine-grain measurements of temperature
              and moisture will be collected across an experimental watershed in the Western
              Cascades to address this critical need.  An additional sampling effort will
              focus on an active area of community transition, because shifts in these
              transitions have been highlighted as potential early warning signs of climate
              change. This research will examine how temperature and moisture influence the
              transition from forest dominated by Tsuga heterophylla to forest dominated by
              Abies amabilis.  Simulation models based on generated data will facilitate
              synthesis and identify areas of potential climatic sensitivity.
