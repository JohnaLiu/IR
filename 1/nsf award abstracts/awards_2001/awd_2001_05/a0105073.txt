ABSTRACT
'Female choice' is a form of sexual selection
              well documented at the level of precopulatory choice and helps to explain many
              male traits (e.g. peacock feathers).  After or during copulation, however,
              females may differentially influence the fate of ejaculate from two or more
              males to affect paternity outcomes.  This phenomenon, referred to as 'cryptic
              female choice' (CFC), is currently under intense investigation because 1) it
              adds a new dimension to the evolutionary conflict between the sexes, and 2) it
              changes our views on the degree to which females influence male reproductive
              success. 
This study examines the relationship between two species of
              tephritid flies with divergent mating systems and the potential for female
              influence on sperm use and storage. One species mates infrequently and has a
              complex courtship behavior, whereas the other species mates frequently and has
              minimal courtship behavior.  CFC is predicted to be more important in species
              that exhibit multiple matings with little pre-copulatory choice. This study
              uses a multi-pronged approach to estimate the presence and degree of female
              influence on reproductive outcomes by examining sperm storage, mating behavior,
              neuromuscular control, and paternity outcomes in relation to male
              characters.
