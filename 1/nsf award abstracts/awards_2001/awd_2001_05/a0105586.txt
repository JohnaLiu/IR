Abstract    :
              Kleene algebra with tests (KAT) is a system for describing and
manipulating
              computations and assertions.  KAT allows propositional logic
and the algebra
              of programs to be integrated seamlessly into a single
system that is
              remarkably powerful in expressive and deductive
power, yet computationally and
              conceptually simple.

KAT has many applications in computer science.  In
              particular
it has recently been used to specify and verify various
              communication
protocols and common compiler optimizations.  It does so more
              simply
and with less effort than more traditional systems such as
              Hoare
Logic.

In this proposal, we propose (i) to further develop the theory
              of KAT;
(ii) to produce a research monograph of significant scope giving
              a
comprehensive introduction to KAT; and (ii) to continue to investigate
the
              use of KAT in practical program verification.
