Abstract    :
              The mutualism (actinorhizal symbiosis) between the genus Cercocarpus, a shrub or
              tree in the rose family (Rosaceae) found in western North America, and Frankia,
              a nitrogen-fixing filamentous bacterium, is a system that may have experienced
              cospeciation.  We propose to generate hypothesized evolutionary histories for
              Cercocarpus using DNA sequence and chloroplast restriction site data, and
              strains of Frankia infective on Cercocarpus using DNA sequence data.  We will
              also test the host-specificity of these Frankia strains towards Cercocarpus
              species and other plants that have the ability to interact with Frankia.   In
              addition, we will test whether the evolutionary histories of Cercocarpus and
              Frankia exhibit a pattern of cospeciation.  The phylogeny produced for
              Cercocarpus will help clarify the confusing taxonomy, species boundaries, and
              relationships among species in this genus. 

Our study will be one of the
              first comprehensive examinations of possible cospeciation in groups involved in
              actinorhizal symbiosis. No comparably broad surveys of infective strains of
              Frankia exist for an actinorhizal genus, nor such broad scale identification
              and description of strains infective on members of the rose family.  
              Information on the strains of Frankia infective on the members of the rose
              family can be used in comparisons with other known actinorhizal groups and our
              documentation of the diversity of Frankia may identify strains that can be used
              in agriculture.
