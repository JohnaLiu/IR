Abstract    :
              The proposal deals with some new classes of codes applicable to computer and
              VLSI system. New design methods for balanced codes, where each codeword
              contains equal number of 1's and 0's, and low weight codes are investigated.
              These codes find broad applications - reducing noise and conserving power in
              VLSI systems, maintaining data integrity in write-once memories, obtaining
              delay insensitive communications in asynchronous systems, data encoding in
              fiber optics, etc. New classes of higher radix and binary Gray codes are also
              investigated. In Gray code sequence, two consecutive codewords differ in one
              digit position by 1. Gray codes find applications in wide areas - analog to
              digital converters, data compression, graphics and image processing, hashing,
              efficient combinatorial algorithm design, processor allocation in the
              hypercube, solving puzzles such as towers of Hanoi, etc. Our goal is to find
              new methods for designing these codes. Some preliminary results and the future
              research efforts related to these topics are described.
