Abstract    :
              Understanding the way in which predators interact with prey communities is a
              central challenge of ecology, and becomes more difficult and important in
              habitats disturbed by humans. Habitat destruction and nutrient enrichment,
              common anthropogenic effects on ecosystems, may shift systems from being
              prey-limited to being habitat-limited, with important consequences for
              predators.  Predators may be less effective at controlling prey populations,
              and this likely has far-reaching effects on ecosystem characteristics.
Pacific
              northwest streams provide a compelling example of these dynamics. Preliminary
              evidence for larval Pacific giant salamanders, dominant predators in old growth
              forest streams, suggests that logging shifts the ecosystem from being
              prey-limited to being habitat-limited.   Experimental food and habitat addition
              at old growth and logged sites will determine whether salamander larvae are
              limited by habitat or by prey. Further, manipulating salamander densities and
              monitoring the prey community will determine the relative impact on the
              abundance and diversity of prey.
