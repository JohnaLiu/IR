Proposal Title: 	Synthesis and Characterization of Model Catalysts
              Formed by Reaction of Metal Carbonyls                                 with

The objective of
              this proposal is to grow and characterize model supported catalysts formed by
              adsorbing metal carbonyls onto planar hydroxylated alumina films grown on a
              refractory metal substrate.  Oxide films will be deposited onto single crystal
              substrates.  With these model systems, surface science techniques can be used
              to define and characterize surface species more precisely than can be done with
              conventional catalysts.  The nature of the active catalyst will be probed using
              x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to monitor metal oxidation state, electron
              energy loss spectroscopy to estimate cluster sizes, reflection-absorption
              infrared spectroscopy to follow vibrational changes, and temperature-programmed
              desorption to measure decarbonylation kinetics.  The two systems to be studied
              are alumina-supported molybdenum and alumina-supported rhenium catalysts for
              olefin metathesis. The metathesis reaction has wide industrial applications,
              and obtaining a better understanding of the catalysis through model studies may
              help in the development of improved catalysts.  The synthesis of realistic
              planar model supported catalysts, and the corresponding ability to fully
              analyze the surface, provides a powerful strategy for fundamentally
              understanding catalytic reactions on realistic supported systems.
