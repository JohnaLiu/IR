Abstract    :
              An intriguing reproductive feature of Daphnia and other Cladocera in lake
              plankton is that they produce dormant eggs that can hatch after many years in
              lake sediments.  Dormant Daphnia eggs in lake sediment are a zoological analog
              to the "seed banks" of terrestrial plants in soils.  Dormant eggs in surface
              sediment are a reservoir of genetic diversity for active populations, and older
              eggs in deeper sediments are a record of genetic structure in past populations.
               

This project will analyze the genetic composition of the Daphnia egg bank
              in sediments from a Minnesota lake to evaluate whether the population has
              evolved in response to natural selection imposed by predation by rainbow trout
              that have been stocked annually for the past 40 years.  It will 1) compare the
              genetic composition of the egg bank at times in the past with that of the
              active resident population and  2) estimate the effects of hatching of dormant
              eggs in surface sediment on the demography of the active population.  A novel
              feature is that for the past decade this lake has been monitored the genetics
              and demography of active zooplankton populations, permitting evaluation of the
              linkages between active populations and the pool of dormant eggs.  The goal is
              to link short-term variations of genetic diversity to long-term evolutionary
              dynamics.
