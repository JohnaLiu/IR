The main objective of this research project is to develop
              a new generation numerical geodynamo model based on a domain decomposition
              technique that divides the fluid part of the Earth's core into six identical
              subdomains with the same metric tensor and nearly uniform grids. The
              computationally expensive Legendre transform is no longer needed and many
              available efficient algorithms can be used in each subdomain. The pole
              singularities of spherical coordinates are removed. The new model will be
              particularly suitable for efficient implementation on parallel computers.
              Preliminary results obtained for a kinematic dynamo model show that the
              proposed domain decomposition technique is both workable and extremely
              efficient.  A convection-driven, nonlinear geodynamo model will be developed
              for a rotating spherical shell that will operate at an Ekman number smaller
              than 10^{-6}.
