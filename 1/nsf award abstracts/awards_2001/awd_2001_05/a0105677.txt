Abstract    :
              This research investigates core architectural features for secure and private
              communications and computations over the public Internet and wireless
              infrastructures.  It focuses on what instruction-set architecture (ISA)
              features general-purpose processors would have, if secure information
              processing is the default pervasive mode of operation, with non-secure
              processing the optional mode, rather than vice versa.  It proposes ISA features
              for very fast, flexible, software cryptographic processing, not only for
              current algorithms but also to enable algorithm designers to create new
              cryptographic algorithms that are more secure and more efficient. 
              Word-oriented, programmable processors can be radically more effective for
              cryptographic functions with new instructions for sub-word manipulations, as
              well as for multi-word arithmetic.  Novel bit permutation instructions are
              proposed for providing superior diffusion capabilities for current and future
              symmetric key algorithms.  Their performance, area and latency tradeoffs, and
              scalability with superscalar organizations are studied.   Very fast table
              lookup and other ISA features are also studied for algorithms like Rijndael,
              the recent Advanced Encryption Standard winner, and for public-key algorithms
              like Elliptic Curve Cryptography.  The research also investigates architectural
              features for secure key management, and other ISA features designed to enhance
              or enforce system security.
