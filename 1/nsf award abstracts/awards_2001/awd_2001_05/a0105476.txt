Members of the extinct conifer family Cheirolepidiaceae
              evolved high levels of morphological diversity and reproductive sophistication,
              and were among the dominant land plants of the Mesozoic Era. Nevertheless, many
              aspects of the structure and evolution of these plants remain poorly
              understood. This situation represents a significant gap in our understanding of
              the Mesozoic world and the evolutionary history of seed plants. The proposed
              research involves the collection and/or description of new cheirolepidiaceous
              conifers from sites in Arkansas, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey that
              will elucidate the structure, diversity and evolution of this intriguing
              family. In addition to the first description of the important genus Hirmeriella
              from North America, at least three new taxa, as well as the only intact seed
              cones of the cosmopolitan species Pseudofrenelopsis parceramosa, will be
              described. In addition, a preliminary phylogenetic analysis of the
              Cheirolepidiaceae will be undertaken. Although much of the current state of
              knowledge regarding these plants is based on European collections, the proposed
              research will demonstrate that North America was a major locus of
              cheirolepidiacean diversity and evolution
