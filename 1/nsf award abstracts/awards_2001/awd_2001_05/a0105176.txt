Abstract    :
              The development of all organisms is regulated by a wide variety of genes that
              interact and control one another. Recent research has revealed that many of
              these sets of genes are shared across a wide variety of plants and animals. A
              very real question then emerges: if the same genes influence development in all
              of these organisms, how do the organisms come to be so different from one
              another? Obviously, the properties of the genes themselves must be changing
              through time. This project aims to address the question of how quickly these
              changes occur and whether or not the rate of change is influenced by a gene's
              role in the regulatory hierarchy. This research focuses on several naturally
              occurring species of monkeyflowers (Mimulus) and measures rates of change for
              three genes that interact in regulating flower development using DNA sequencing
              and an analysis of genetic variation both within and between species.

This
              work will shed light on how variation in developmental processes can lead to
              the vast diversity we see among living organisms. This not only addresses a
              fundamental issue in biology, but can also lead to a better understanding of
              the function of the genes themselves, which has potential implications for both
              agriculture and human health.
