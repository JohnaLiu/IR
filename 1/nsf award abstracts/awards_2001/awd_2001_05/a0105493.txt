The interaction of convection currents in Earth's mantle
              with the mantle transition zone (410 to 660 km depth) affects the pattern of
              mantle circulation and hence evolution of this planet. This interaction depends
              strongly on the change in physical properties that occurs in the transition
              zone, particularly the rheological properties. To help understand the influence
              of rheological properties of transition zone materials on this interaction, the
              PI proposes to conduct experimental studies on plastic flow in transition zone
              minerals  
(wadsleyite and ringwoodite respectively) under the transition zone
              conditions with the emphasis on the effects of water and grain-size. Both
              grain-size and water can change significantly as convection currents go through
              the transition zone. The investigators will extend their previous studies into
              two new directions; (1) to investigate the effects of water on rheology and
              deformation fabric, and (2) to improve the quality of data by better-defined
              (constant strain-rate) deformation experiments and by stress measurements using
              the synchrotron radiation facility and transmission electron microscopy.  These
              results will provide the first quantitative data set on the effects of water
              and grain-size on rheology and deformation fabric of major transition zone
              minerals and a firm basis for interpretation of seismic anisotropy in the
              transition zone.
