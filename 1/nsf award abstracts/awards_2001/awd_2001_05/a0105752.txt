Abstract    :
              Online computation involves optimization problems for which the input
              is
revealed progressively. Online algorithms base their decisions only on
              the
past without knowledge of the future, much in the same way that a
              stock
market investor or a robot that explores an unknown environment
              decide
about their next action. Naturally such problems of decision-making
              with
incomplete information arise in many areas. During the last
              decade
research in the area of online algorithms has been very intensive.
              Still,
some of the fundamental problems remain unresolved and important
              problems
arise from new applications. The project deals both with old and
              new
online problems.

Perhaps the most important fundamental unsolved
              problem is the k-server
problem. The objective is to settle the k-server
              conjecture and to
investigate other variants of the problem such as the
              k-taxicab problem
and the CNN problem. Another objective is to design and
              analyze
competitive algorithms for a related problem, the online matching
              problem
on Euclidean spaces; some interesting variants of the problem seem to
              play
a central role in new e-commerce applications. For all these and
              many
other problems, one algorithm, the generalized Work Function
              Algorithm,
seems to have almost optimal competitive ratio. The research
              addresses the
roots of this phenomenon.

Research deals also with the
              pertinent problem of indexing of databases;
the size of datasets of real
              applications has been increasing dramatically
and so does the importance of
              good indexing schemes. Competitive analysis
can be used to quantify how much
              the performance of indexing schemes is
affected by changes in a database.
              Finally, the techniques of competitive
analysis are a useful tool to address
              specific game-theoretic problems in
networks.
