This project consists of a series laboratory fluid dynamical
              experiments designed to simulate processes that are important in the generation
              of the geomagnetic field in Earth's liquid outer core. One set of experiments
              will be conducted in rotating hemispherical shells of fluid, and are intended
              to model thermal convection in the self-gravitating, rotating, spherical
              geometry of the core. The purpose here is to delineate those characteristics of
              rotating spherical shell convection that can be used to interpret seismic and
              geomagnetic images of the core. A second series of laboratory experiments will
              be conducted on thermochemical convection in solidifying gallium-indium alloys,
              with and without the influences of rotation and externally applied magnetic
              fields. 
The gallium-indium alloy is analogous to the iron-rich alloy of the
              outer core, and the solidification represents the growth of Earth's solid inner
              core. 
These experiments are designed to test the assumptions of the
              gravitationally powered dynamo model, which is widely regarded as the most
              likely energy source for the geodynamo, and to determine the properties of
              turbulent fluid motion in the environment of the outer core.
