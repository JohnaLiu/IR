Title:	Dissertation Research:  Ecological Effects of Temporal and Spatial
              Variability in the Disturbance Regime of an Old-growth Ponderosa Pine
              Forest

Although southwestern forests historically have been subjected to a
              disturbance regime that includes frequent fires, many tree species are
              sensitive to fire, especially during juvenile states of development. 
              Paradoxically, fires occurring at mean intervals should exclude even dominant
              species such as Ponderosa Pine.  This suggests that extended intervals without
              fire are required for the establishment of Ponderosa pine and other
              fire-sensitive species.  Within this context, the proposed research addresses
              central issues in disturbance ecology with important implications to forestry
              and resource management. The effects of temporal variation in fire-return
              intervals are investigated with respect to the demography of dominant and
              sub-dominant species of tree, as this can have a significant impact on forest
              diversity.   In addition, mathematical models are developed which consider the
              likelihood of fires occurring within a specified area.  This provides
              quantitative insights concerning the scaling of effects for disturbance.
