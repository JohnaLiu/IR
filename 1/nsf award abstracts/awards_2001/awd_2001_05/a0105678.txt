This research concerns the finding of approximate
              solutions.
It is often the case that finding exact solutions is vastly
              too
expensive in terms of the time required, to the point of
being
              infeasible.  Yet fairly accurate solutions which are
"good enough" may be
              obtainable in a much shorter time, and
consequently be more practical.  The
              specific problem domains
on which this research focuses range from pattern
              matching
(for example, devising algorithms to find similar and/or
repeating
              patterns in DNA sequences) to intrinsically
intractable problems such as the
              travelling salesman problem
(which amounts to finding a shortest route
              connecting a
collection of cities).

  The research on string matching is
              considering new notions
of approximation so as to devise efficient algorithms
              for a
broader class of approximate matches than is feasible presently;
both
              searches between pairs of strings and against a database
of strings are being
              studied.  The second part of our research
focuses on NP-hard problems.  We are
              looking at multicost
shortest path problems (e.g. with a cost comprising
              both
time and price) in which one seeks all non-dominated solutions,
at
              improving the quality of approximations for the Travelling
Salesman Problem in
              the plane, and also at improving the
approximations obtainable for generalized
              Steiner Tree problems.
