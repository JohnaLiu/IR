Abstract    :
              This research addresses the roles of direct organic nitrogen (N) uptake in
              higher plant nutrition and terrestrial ecosystem nutrient cycling. It is
              hypothesized that plant use of organic N, particularly free amino acids (AA),
              is more prevalent in terrestrial ecosystems than currently perceived. Although
              the extent of AA uptake may depend on a variety of soil and plant factors, AA
              uptake may act as a general mechanism of plant N acquisition along with mineral
              N uptake. The research will use stable isotope labeling techniques in field and
              greenhouse experiments to investigate the generality of AA uptake, and to
              quantify the contribution of directly acquired external AA to plant
              productivity and nitrogen cycling for four contrasting ecosystems in the
              Southeast USA. This research will investigate AA uptake by plants growing in
              situ in temperate terrestrial ecosystems, and the ecological implications of AA
              uptake in these ecosystems.
