Abstract    :
              This award supports preliminary site investigations and logistics planning for
              an ambitious drilling project to recover a series of ~400 meter-long continuous
              sediment cores from Lake Malawi at the southern end of the East African Rift
              Valley.  

Previous studies from the region show the area to be a unique
              outdoor laboratory and archive for the study of tropical paleoclimatology,
              tectonics, and evolutionary biology.  Consequently, Lake Malawi holds the
              promise of providing a high-resolution paleoclimate record of unparalleled
              antiquity in a region highly sensitive to climate change and critical for
              understanding the dynamics of the Earth's climate system.
