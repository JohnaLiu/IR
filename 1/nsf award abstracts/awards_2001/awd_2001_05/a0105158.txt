ABSTRACT

This proposal
              concerns the completion of several works of Thomas H. Wolff.
Wolff's recent
              unfinished work concerns the restriction conjecture and
Kakeya problem,
              Anderson models, and spectral gap properties of measures.
In addition, he was
              in the process of writing an introductory book
for analysis students about the
              restriction conjecture and Kakeya problem. 
 

 Wolff was a recognized
              leader in the field of harmonic analysis.
He received the 1985 Salem prize and
              1999 Bocher prize for his work, as
well as being invited to speak at the
              International Congress of
Mathematicians in 1986 and 1999. Many projects were
              in progress at the
time of his tragic death on July 31, 2000.  The PI proposes
              to undertake
supervision of their completion.
