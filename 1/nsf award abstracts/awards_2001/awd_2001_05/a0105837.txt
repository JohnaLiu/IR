A precise estimate of the osmium isotopic composition of
              the convecting upper mantle is one of the prerequisites to obtain constraints
              on the likely proportion of recycled oceanic crust in this reservoir as well as
              in the bulk mantle. Previous Re-Os work on mid-ocean-ridge basalts and abyssal
              peridotites, materials commonly used to constrain the composition of the
              convecting upper mantle, encountered various problems. In some instances, it
              has been suspected that 187Os/188Os of both rock types may have been increased
              by contamination with seawater, yielding chondritic to suprachondritic
              187Os/188Os for bulk rocks. Re-Os data on peridotite whole rocks from a
              Jurassic oceanic peridotite massif (Totalp ultramafic massif, Swiss Alps) range
              between sub- and suprachondritic, similar to abyssal peridotites. This massif
              contains concordant pyroxenitic layers that show subchondritic to highly
              radiogenic initial 187Os/188Os at 160 Ma, the age of the overlying pelagic
              sediments. It has been suggested that pyroxenites may be a minor component in
              the convecting upper mantle. This pilot study will attempt to confirm the
              results on whole rocks by obtaining Re-Os data on mineral separates from
              pyroxenites and peridotites that show suprachondritic 187Os/188Os. In the case
              of the pyroxenites, consistent internal mineral isochrones should confirm the
              validity of the highly radiogenic initial 187Os/188Os, whereas for the
              radiogenic peridotites, initial 187Os/188Os for whole rocks should coincide
              with initial 187Os/188Os of individual phases. Jurassic Re-Os ages for the
              pyroxenites would support the notion that crystal precipitation and melting
              occurred at about this time, and that the pyroxenites and their radiogenic Os
              were derived from the convecting upper mantle.
