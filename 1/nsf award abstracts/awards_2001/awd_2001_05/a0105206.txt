Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to examine the climatology and seasonal circulation
              patterns in West and Central Africa and investigate the relationship of biomass
              fires and tropospheric ozone levels of the Tropical Atlantic.  High ozone
              levels in the tropical Atlantic have major implications for global atmospheric
              chemistry and potential environmental effects throughout the tropics.  The
              principal investigator is utilizing visible and infrared satellite imagery and
              numerical modeling of selected case studies to isolate key transport mechanisms
              for ozone and ozone precursors.  The project involves significant collaboration
              with African scientists.
