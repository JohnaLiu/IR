The mixing or
              segregation of cohesive granular materials is considered in the context of
              three particle-level sources of cohesion: liquid bridge (capillary) formation,
              Van der Wals forces, or electrostatic interaction.  The method of Particle
              Dynamic Simulation, already tested in the simple case of free-flowing powders
              (no cohesion), will be used to establish the macroscopic flows which are
              induced by these microscopic cohesion effects.  Among other results, it will
              yield the prediciton of mixing or separation in simple granular flows.  Special
              attention is given to the "liquid bridge" (or interstitial) modeling, which
              includes surface tension, pressure and viscous forces, and the roughness of the
              surfaces involved.
