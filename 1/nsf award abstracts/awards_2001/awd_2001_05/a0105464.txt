This Americas award will support a visit to Brazil for Drs
              Herbert L. Windom and Richard A. Jahnke of the Skidaway Institute of
              Oceanography to plan a collaborative research proposal in the area of coastal
              marine biogeochemistry with Dr. Felipe Niencheski, Loaboratorio de Hidroquimica
              of Fundacao Universidade Do Rio Grande in Brazil.

Topics for discussion
              during the proposed visit will include chemical and advective processes in
              coarse-grain sediments and their effect on coastal marine chemistry.  Since
              coastal lagoons comprise 13% of the world's coastline, a study of these systems
              is critical to understanding how inputs from them can alter the biogeochemistry
              of the adjacent coastal ocean.
