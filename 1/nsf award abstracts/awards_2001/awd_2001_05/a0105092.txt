Abstract    :
              Methyl halides are important trace gases in atmospheric chemistry.  Methyl
              bromide and methyl chloride supply a significant amount of inorganic chlorine
              and bromine to the stratosphere where they catalyze ozone loss. Methyl
              chloride, methyl bromide and methyl iodide are also active in lower atmosphere
              chemistry and may impact the cleansing rate of the troposphere. Consequently,
              methyl bromide, a widely used agricultural fumigant, is being regulated in the
              U.S. and abroad.  As anthropogenic sources of these gases decline with time due
              to regulation natural halogen sources will dominate. Agricultural emissions of
              these gases must be quantified and understood.

Recent field research has
              shown that globally significant amounts of methyl bromide and methyl iodide are
              produced by worldwide rice agriculture.  We propose to determine the effects of
              certain abiotic factors (including soil halide amounts and light levels) on
              methyl halide production in rice and to examine the underlying physiology and
              biochemistry of the plant response.  These studies will incorporate in-situ
              (seasonal greenhouse measurements) and in-vivo (leaf-disk enzyme assays)
              studies
