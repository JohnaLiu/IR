Abstract    :
              The investigators will study electron solitary holes (ESH) on auroral magnetic
              field lines.  ESH are positive potential wells moving at a fraction of the
              electron thermal speed with parallel scale sizes the order of the Debye length
              and variable perpendicular scale sizes.  The CLUSTER satellites have
              instrumentation for measuring plasma waves and electron distribution functions.
               These data can be used to study the origin, evolution, lifetimes and effects
              of ESH.  The four satellites making up the CLUSTER II mission were successfully
              launched in the summer of 2000 and all instruments are working nominally.  The
              investigators have developed plasma wave receivers and interferometers for many
              years and have studied ESH using data from the POLAR spacecraft.  ESH have
              recently been observed in the auroral acceleration zone, plasma sheet,
              cusp/cleft, high latitude boundary layer, shock transition region, and possibly
              the wake of Europa in the solar wind.  Study of this phenomenon is essential to
              our understanding of space weather and plasma processes in the magnetosphere.
