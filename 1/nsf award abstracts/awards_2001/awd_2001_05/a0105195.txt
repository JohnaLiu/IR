In this project, the PI
              will continue 
to develop Poisson Morse theory, the theme of which is to
use
              Poisson structures to study the topology of the underlying
manifolds.  She
              will also study a moduli space of a class 
of Poisson structures, which is
              closely connected to semi-simple 
symmetric spaces and their
              compactifications. 


Poisson structures first arose in the 19'th century in
              the 
study of classical mechanics.  Nowadays Poisson geometry is 
being
              influenced by and has applications in 
theoretical physics such as string
              theory. In the same spirit,
this proposal is about the rich connections
              between Poisson geometry and 
various other fields of mathematics and
              mathematical physics, such
as topology, Lie theory, Hopf algebras, and
              integrable systems. 
It also has applications in control theory and
              robotics.
