Abstract    :
              This research is concerned with the development, analysis 
and empirical
              evaluation of algorithms for information 
retrieval and data mining, primarily
              using spectral analysis. 
A partial list of the fundamental questions
being
              addressed are:  How should data be stored,
organized and processed so as to
              allow the most effective retrieval of
information?  How can ``important''
              structure and ``meaningful''
patterns be found within a large data-set? How
              and when can this
hidden structure be used to facilitate determination of
              missing data
or to ``clean'' data that is imprecise or partially
              incorrect?
What are appropriate models for data generation, and how can
these
              models be used to improve the design of data mining algorithms?

The
              researchers are studying applications that have already 
received a great deal
              of attention and on which
empirical success has been achieved, including
              object
clustering and web site ranking. In addition, they are designing 
and
              analyzing algorithms, and developing and analyzing models 
for newer data
              mining problems, including collaborative filtering, 
topic distillation, spam
              detection and prevention, and hierarchical
clustering.  Matrix perturbation
              theory is the foundation for the 
development of theoretical results. The
              researchers are also studying
new techniques for speeding up the computation
              of the SVD.
The theoretical research is being complemented by
experimental
              evaluation on real data sets.
