Abstract    :
              This purpose of the proposed research is to examine how situational awareness
              (or its other similar outcroppings) develop within work dyads and teams
              required to behave very reliably, as in high reliability organizations (study
              1). A second purpose is to examine what, if any, relationship exists between
              situational awareness and other local global processes (study 2). The
              investigators are particularly interested in contexts where errors of judgment
              or inference can lead to catastrophe. The investigators also intend to provide
              some theoretical rigor around the psychological constructs guiding the first
              part of the research, and embed those constructs within group processes (study
              2), deepening our basic knowledge of the ways individual and group cognitive
              processes interact with contexts. Study 1 will focus on the Oakland Police
              Department's Emergency Dispatching Service (911), while Study 2 will take place
              at the Stanford anesthesiology simulator, which provides a situation in which
              distributed cognition can be more thoroughly investigated, and in which actors
              are tied to technologies long ago invented to solve an anesthesiology or
              operating problem.
