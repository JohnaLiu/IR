A Long-Term Paleoecological Record of Coral Reef Communities

Reef coral communities living during the past 500
              ka (thousand years) show remarkable persistence in taxonomic composition and
              diversity during multiple episodes of global climate change. In contrast,
              similar studies conducted over decadal time scales in living reefs show
              striking change and unpredictability with apparent dramatic and unprecedented
              decline during the past 30 years.  This apparent paradox confounds attempts to
              predict the response of coral reefs to local and global environmental change.
              This research will investigate the taxonomic composition and diversity of coral
              communities, using a long term paleoecological record between 9000 and 6000
              years before present (ybp) in the Holocene raised reef terrace along a 35 km
              segment of coastline of the Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea (PNG).  The
              exposed fossil reef from the 3000-year Holocene interval preserves fossil
              assemblages before and after a clearly identifiable, narrowly dated, and
              widespread earthquake disturbance event. The 20 m high Holocene seacliffs
              contain a shallow fore-reef habitat that exquisitely preserves reef coral
              assemblages, and can be dated and sampled with a resolution within 150 years.
              This temporal framework, inaccessible in living reefs, corresponds well to the
              life history attributes of the long-living corals, and provides the key link
              between studies of older Pleistocene assemblages and modern studies at decadal
              time scales. Study of the PNG paleoecological record of coral reefs in the
              absence of significant human impact will document: 1) patterns in coral
              community structure every 150 years for 3000 years, including post-disturbance
              community re-colonization; and 2) the relationship between coral species
              distribution patterns through time and space and global climate and local
              environmental variation, during continuous sea level rise and variable Holocene
              sea surface temperatures.  Ecological data will be gathered by conducting
              surveys measuring the abundance of reef coral species along 25-m transects
              representing similar age assemblages over a 35 km distance. Previous work
              differentiating the ancient habitats will be corroborated using sedimentology
              and composition of the coralline algal communities.  A significant component of
              this research is to relate species distribution patterns through time and space
              to fluctuations in their environment.  Thus, the Holocene reef environment will
              be characterized using 'paired' geochemical analyses (isotopic and trace
              element) of corals and mollusks. A detailed temporal sequence will be
              established for each of the sampled Holocene reef geological sections using
              abundant  14C (radiocarbon) age dates.
