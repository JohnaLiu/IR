Abstract    :
              The Investigator studies intersection theory on and the
cohomological field
              theory arising from the moduli of algebraic
spin curves and stable spin maps.
              Especially important in this
study is the exploration of the plethora of
              similarities between
Gromov-Witten theory and cohomological field arising from
              higher
spin curves and spin maps. Also important in this research is
              the
study of the many relations between these cohomological field
theories
              and integrable hierarchies, including significant recent
progress toward
              proving some remarkable conjectures like the
W-algebra conjecture and
              Generalized Witten Conjecture.

The research in this project is concerned
              with connections between
algebraic geometry and physics, and it has
              implications for both
subjects.  Algebraic geometry, which is the study of
              solutions to
polynomial equations, and especially the sub-discipline
              of
algebraic curves, which is one of the main foci of this research,
have
              many applications.  The most notable of these applications
are in secure
              electronic communications (cryptography and error
correcting codes).  Recent
              research has shown that algebraic
geometry also has significant ties to
              high-energy physics and
plays an important role in helping us understand the
              fundamental
nature of the universe.  Conversely, physics has helped us
              better
understand some important aspects of algebraic geometry and
              its
applications.  This research is focused on studying and
              further
developing some of these important links.
