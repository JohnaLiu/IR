Dr. Smith is awarded an NSF Astronomy
              and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and
              education at the University of Michigan.  He will work with the Robotic Optical
              Transient Search Experiment (ROTSE) project, a program to distribute and
              operate at least four small, automatic telescopes at widely separated points on
              Earth in order to capture the early optical emission from an extensive sample
              of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).  Early observations will yield constraints on
              characteristics of the burst origins.  The telescope design allows GRB
              observations during the important window between five and forty seconds after
              the onset of the event, which no other current or planned experiment will be
              able to achieve.  Dr. Smith will develop the operational and analysis software,
              use existing instruments to respond to alerts, install units at the
              international sites, and train collaborators in the use of the system.  The
              ROTSE project also provides a large database of all-sky observations for
              student projects and his work will involve undergraduate students in the
              research.  He also intends to develop a course in observational astronomy and
              presentations at a local museum using the ROTSE database, as well as an
              interactive tool providing access for the public and researchers alike.
