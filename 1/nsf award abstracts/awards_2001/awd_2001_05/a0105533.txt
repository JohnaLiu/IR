Abstract    :
              
This research involves two applications of graph algorithms; the
              first
regards communication in networks, the second involves solving
              flow
problems in structured networks.  The investigators study algorithms
for
              finding paths connecting many communicating parties in a network.
The goal is
              that the paths do not overutilize any particular link in
the network.   The
              second item the investigators will study  is
the famous problem of routing the
              maximum amount of flow through
a network. This problem is itself interesting
              and has numerous
applications in fields as diverse as transportation and
              computer vision.


More specifically, the investigaters study low congestion
              routing in
networks.  This problem is easy in a relaxed fractional setting
              but
notoriously difficult in an integral setting.  Recent work
              has
established relationships between a cut based upper bound and
              the
fractional lower bound on this problem.  These results will lead
              to
better understanding of the integral version of this problem.
Research on
              this problem has made use of techniques from linear
programming, randomized
              rounding, combinatorial graph theory, as well
as geometric embeddings of graph
              metrics. For the maximum flow
problem, the investigaters study ideas in a
              recent maximum flow
algorithm in order to extend them to the minimum cost flow
              problem.
The investigators also study the maximum flow problems on planar
              and
other restricted classes of graphs.
