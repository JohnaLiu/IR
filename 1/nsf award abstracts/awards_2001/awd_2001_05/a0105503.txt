Abstract    :
              The proposed research will investigate architectural approaches to optimize
              memory-hierarchy performance, focusing on the gap between the lowest level of
              on-chip cache and the off-chip DRAM.  Prior work has shown that the combination
              of careful scheduling of prefetch requests on dedicated high-band width DRAM
              channels and careful placement of prefetch data in the cache can make very
              aggressive prefetching schemes practical.  The proposed work builds on this
              framework in three directions: integration of multiple prefetch-generation
              sources, development of prefetching based on run-ahead threads, and integration
              of prefetching and replacement such that predictions of future access patterns
              can be applied in both domains.  In each of the proposed  areas, detailed
              designs will be developed, tested, and iteratively refined via simulation.  As
              solutions in each area firm up, the results will be integrated into a unified
              model to work out interactions among the mechanisms.  The overall objective of
              the research is to develop and analyze an integrated memory system that
              delivers maximum efficiency across a range of DRAM-constrained system
              workloads.  The impact of these design techniques will be to increase the
              efficiency and performance of the high-performance systems used as database,
              web, and technical computing servers, increasing their responsiveness and
              capacity.
