Evolution can occur through several different processes.  One
              process that has important implications for the evolution of many traits,
              including those related to aging, is the correlated response of a trait at one
              age to selection on that same trait at a different age. More specifically, how
              a trait measured at many different ages (also called an ontogenetic trajectory)
              responds to selection at one specific age is poorly understood.  In this study,
              lines of laboratory mice selected for voluntary activity and unselected control
              lines will be used to examine the influence of early-age selection on a trait's
              ontogenetic trajectory. In both populations, the ontogenetic trajectories of
              one morphological and two behavioral traits will be described, changes in the
              patterns of genetic variance and covariance of all three traits across all ages
              measured, and patterns of genetic variance and covariance partitioned to
              determine how genetic variation contributes to each trajectory.  

These
              results will provide predictions about the effects of future selection on each
              ontogenetic trajectory, identify genetic tradeoffs during aging, and determine
              the effect of selection on the genetic variation underlying each trait.  This
              information is important to the further development of evolutionary theory, and
              to gaining a better understanding of the genetics and evolution of aging.
