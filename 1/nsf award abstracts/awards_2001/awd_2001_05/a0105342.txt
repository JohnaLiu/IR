This project is centered around a
              topological study
of complex hyperplane arrangements, with a view
              towards
finding effectively computable invariants of their complements.
The
              goal is to decide whether a given invariant is
combinatorially determined,
              and, if it is, to express
it explicitly in terms of the intersection lattice
              of
the arrangement.  An important role is played by the
jumping loci for
              cohomology with coefficients in local
systems, and the related resonance
              varieties.
These varieties have emerged as a central object of study.
They
              provide deep information about the homotopy theory
of the complement of an
              arrangement, as well as
a bridge relating various invariants, in often
              unexpected ways.
Another key role is played by the rational-homotopy
notion
              of formality, which provides the underlying
explanation for many of the
              encountered phenomena.
Whenever possible, the study is done in a more general
              setting,
which includes certain types of subspace arrangements,
both real and
              complex, as well as certain links in the 3-sphere.
Such a point of view
              enlarges the range of applicability of the
results, and helps explain what is
              really peculiar to complex
hyperplane arrangements.

In its simplest
              manifestation, an arrangement is a
finite collection of lines in the plane. 
              These lines
cut the plane into components, and understanding the topology
of
              the complement amounts to counting those components.
In the case of lines in
              the complex plane (or, for that
matter, hyperplanes in complex n-space), the
              complement
is connected, and its topology (as reflected, for example,
in its
              homotopy groups) is much more interesting.
The theory of arrangements is a
              relatively new branch
of mathematics, started in the 1960's with a study
of
              the classifying space for the pure braid group.
The theory has developed at
              the interface between
topology, algebra, algebraic geometry, and
              combinatorics.
Hyperplane arrangements, and the closely related
configuration
              spaces, are used in numerous areas,
including robotics, multi-dimensional
              billiards,
graphics, molecular biology, computer vision, and
databases for
              representing the space of all possible
states of a system characterized by
              many degrees
of freedom. There are also deep connections between
hyperplane
              arrangements, knot theory, hypergeometric
functions, conformal field theory,
              and quantum cohomology.
