Abstract    :
              This research will examine classified satellite images of Arctic sea-ice in
              order to evaluate the temporal and spatial change in melt ponds in the sea-ice.
               Sea-ice impacts the heat budget of polar areas by reflecting a large majority
              of incoming solar radiation, hence reducing the effect of solar heating.  As
              the summer season progresses, melt ponds develop, absorb significantly more
              sunlight, and increase the ice melt rate.  Details of the development of melt
              ponds can be obtained by direct examination of high-resolution visible
              satellite images.  The proposed research will utilize images from 4 areas of
              the Arctic and 3 summer seasons (1999-2001) and will evaluate the change in
              extent of melt ponds and open water as the summer season progresses.  The
              results will be declassified and open to the public.
