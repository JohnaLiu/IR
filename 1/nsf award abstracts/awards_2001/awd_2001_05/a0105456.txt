Abstract    :
              This laboratory study of subduction is motivated by recent seismic and
              geochemical advances on understanding of subduction and mantle flow attending
              subduction. The PI proposes laboratory experiments similar to those he has done
              for ridges and plumes, to investigate subduction processes. There will be four
              types of analog lab experiments: 1) studies aimed at understanding longitudinal
              subduction vs. rollback (slab sinking), 2) experiments to study the role of
              rollback-style subduction on back arc basin spreading and plate motion, 3)
              experiments to look at the effects of oscillating longitudinal and rollback
              subduction on the thermal structure of the slab and wedge, and 4) the effects
              of this oscillation on generation of mantle diapirs in the wedge region. All
              these experiments have relevance to the processes being studied in the MARGINS
              program. Part of the work will be done at Australian National University (ANU)
              with Ross Griffiths, where Kincaid will spend a one-year sabbatical. This will
              take advantage of the excellent lab facilities available at ANU.
