Dissertation Research: Seasonal changes in biomass and
              diversity of microbes in an extreme environment   

Life in the soils of high
              elevation talus slopes is microbial.  Like soils of polar deserts, high
              elevation talus slopes are characterized by cold temperatures, extremely low
              humidity, little liquid water, high light and UV-B levels, and extreme
              temperature cycling across the freezing point. What controls microbial
              production and biomass?  Early findings by the PI and graduate student Ruth Ley
              have shown that the microbial ecology of this system is exceedingly complex,
              and is characterized by seasonal variations in bacterial and fungal
              assemblages. These intriguing findings have raised the possibility that very
              different suites of organisms comprise these groups. To investigate this
              possibility, the PIs will apply molecular analyses to the techniques used to
              estimate microbial functional group biomass. This study will contribute to the
              field of microbial ecology in extreme environments, and also to elucidating the
              environmental roles of microbial groups about which little is known.
