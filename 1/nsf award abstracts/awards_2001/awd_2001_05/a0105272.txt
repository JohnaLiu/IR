SGER:  Digital
              Aerial Video Mosaics for Ecosystem Carbon Cycle Modeling

This grant will
              support preliminary explorations for applying digital video aerial image
              analysis to long-term issues of global warming, in particular carbon cycle
              modeling, in the government arena.  Many government agencies are already using
              GIS heavily, but in a less dynamic way, relying on single images in time,
              without fine-grain time references.  This project will explore government uses
              of real-time imaging, at resolutions beyond what can be achieved with
              commercial satellite images, allowing the digital film to be geo-referenced,
              integrated with data streams from other sensors, and viewed in 3D through
              polarized glasses.
