Abstract    :
              An undesired consequence of the growing parallelism of modern processors is that
              it is dramatically more difficult to separate the events that limit execution
              speed from the >events whose latencies are tolerated.  A method for focusing
              design effort is critical-path analysis.  This research proposes to apply
              critical-path 
analysis at the micro-architectural level, with the goal of
              detecting and eliminating execution bottlenecks.
This research will explore
              the potential of the critical path in four interrelated efforts: (1) Modeling
              the micro-architectural critical path.  The main task is to define a model of
              the critical path, i.e., the set of events and dependences in a micro-execution
              that will be exposed in the dependence graph on which the critical path
will
              be computed.  (2) Efficient tracing of the critical path.  This effort will
              develop an on-line algorithm that will use a last-arrival edge at each node to
              calculate the critical path in one pass in a simulator. (3) Hardware
              critical-path predictors.  This research will explore the use of approximation
              methods in avoiding the analysis of the entire dependence graph.  (4)
              Criticality-aware processor policies.  This research will
use hardware
              critical-path predictors to focus hardware policies on events likely to be on
              the critical path.
