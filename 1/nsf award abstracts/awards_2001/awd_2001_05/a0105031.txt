This research focuses on the genetic basis for
              reproduction in mushroom-forming fungi. Genes will be isolated from several
              mushroom species through a method termed "positional cloning". Because of the
              hyper-variability of mating-type genes, these genes cannot be isolated or
              cloned using standard protocols. As an alternative strategy, positional cloning
              utilizes the conservation of genes adjacent on the chromosome to the target
              genes. This technique will be applied to isolating the genes controlling mating
              in oyster mushrooms as well other mushroom species that represent unusual
              breeding systems. Finally, the proposed research will determine whether the
              positional cloning strategy can be successfully applied to isolating mating
              genes from the various and diverse subgroups of mushrooms.  

Mushrooms are
              atypical because natural populations of these fungi can contain numerous sexes,
              called mating-types. Unlike animals and many plants that determine sexes
              through sex chromosomes, mushrooms achieve multiple sexes through variation at
              a single genetic locus. The genes controlling mating-type in mushrooms have
              been isolated and the function of the mating-type proteins is well known.
              However, mating-type in fungi has been studied only in two species. Because of
              the great amount of variation in reproductive mode among the mushroom fungi, it
              is important to expand the knowledge of how mating type genes function to
              represent the diversity of this ecologically important group of organisms.
