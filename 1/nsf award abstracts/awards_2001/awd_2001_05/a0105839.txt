Abstract    :
              The research will use a variable-resolution stretched-grid general circulation
              model (SG-GCM) to conduct climate studies on anomalous regional events. The
              following issues will be addressed: (a) numerical experimentation with new
              emerging SG-GCMs incorporating land-surface models; (b) simulation at seasonal
              and interannual temporal scales, and regional-to-global spatial scales; (c)
              improved understanding and modeling of processes that affect regional climate
              variability. The major goals are simulating the 1997-1999 El Nino Southern
              Oscillation and related monsoon circulation with 25-40 km and finer resolution;
              studying intraseasonal and interannual regional climate variability for the
              extended multiyear SG-GCM simulations; studying the impact of sea surface
              temperatures and land-surface forcing on SG-GCM simulations; studying the
              impact of ensemble integrations; and developing educational tools for students.
              The work is important because the SG-GCM formalism may prove to be a viable new
              approach to regional and subregional climate studies and applications.
