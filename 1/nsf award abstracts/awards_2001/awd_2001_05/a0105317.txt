For years studies by government and private groups have
              addressed the changing research climate in the U.S. and also the changing
              education environment at all levels, K-12 through post-graduate.  Many of these
              studies have had a common theme, the need for a closer integration of research
              and education.  New opportunities using this theme continue to exist for
              restructuring or redirecting programs in the Earth and Space Sciences.  Here,
              Earth and space science is defined broadly to include atmospheric sciences,
              geochemistry, geology, geophysics, earth sciences, hydrology, oceanography,
              aeronomy and space physics, and other closely allied disciplines.  One of the
              best ways to move toward integrating research and education is to have open
              discussions with the leaders of departments responsible for the research and
              associated education.  These are the Heads and Chairs of the Earth and Space
              Science Departments.  This award supports the annual meetings of the Heads and
              Chairs over the next three years.
