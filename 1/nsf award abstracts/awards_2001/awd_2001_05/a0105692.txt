Abstract    :
              Error correcting codes were originally invented to increase the
precision of
              retrieval, storage and communication of data.
The investigator's goal is to
              study and develop codes
with new features added on top of the error correcting
              property,
such as  checkability, identifiable parent property (IPP),
              or
quantum-error correcting property. In spite of the
importance of designing
              codes with added features,
there has not ben a comprehensive study of them up
              to date, and each
design is treated as an isolated case. The
              investigator
wants to put the designs under one umbrella (whenever
it is
              possible) so that their properties
can be compared and further improved
              upon.
Among the benefits such improvement can bring about
are better
              non-approximability results in complexity theory,
better means to trace
              pirates of electronic images,
and new algorithms for quantum computers.

The
              investigator was the first to
observe that constructs in the theory of
              probabilistically checkable
proofs can be viewed as error correcting codes
              with added features.
The best parameters for these codes and their kins
              are
still not known, and they are the primary
targets of the proposed
              investigation in the first year.
The investigator also plans for a study
              that
would lead to a general checkability theorem for product codes,
with a
              surprise application in circuit complexity,
and recommends a simplified look
              at Raz's parallel repetition
theorem. A different thread of the the proposed
              research
is motivated by questions about schemes
that protect a multi-media
              publisher against piracy of
electronic images. The publisher can use words of
              a code
to mark electronic copies of an image. Then, if the code
              is
appropriately designed, any image forged by combining pieces of two
              legally
traded images, contains sufficient amount of information to trace
the
              identity of at least one of the source (parent) images.
Here the problem is to
              build efficient codes that can identify one of
three or more source images.
              Other research targets include
efficiently decodable quantum codes,
              and
complexity lower bounds for dynamic problems via unusual codes.
There is
              a general framework in which
the investigator plans to do the research. This
              entails:
1. The study and exploration of the relation in
between different
              unusual codes;
2. Their classification and axiomatization;
3. Search for
              novel applications of unusual codes
in the theories of lower bounds and
              pseudo-randomness,
and in other walks of computer science;
4. Building a
              'family tree' of code properties, and finding a match
in between properties
              and applications.
The methodology should embrace and extend classical coding
              theory.
