This award supports Jennifer Fewell and graduate and
              undergraduate students from Arizona State University in a collaboration with
              Juergen Gadau of Institute for Behavioral Physiology at the University of
              Wuerzburg, Germany.  The aim of the international project is to examine the
              extent and consequences of hybridization between two native seed-harvester
              ants, Pogonomyrmex rugosus and  Pogonomyrmex barbatus.  The German and U.S.
              groups will test the hypothesis that hybridization in that system does not
              universally produce reduced hybrid fitness, as expected by current models. 
              They will also test the hypothesis that colonies respond to hybridization by
              preferentially using sperm belonging to different species.  They will use
              morphological, molecular, and behavioral techniques to determine the extent of
              introgression between species and to measure fitness components of hybridized
              and parental colonies.  In addition, they will perform controlled mating
              experiments to determine the effect of hybridization on caste determaination.
              The work plan provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the
              international travel and research.
