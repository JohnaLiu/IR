Abstract    :
              The Science Museum of Minnesota is requesting $279,577, of a total budget of
              $339,074, to plan and conduct a four-day international conference exploring
              issues, current practices and future directions related to furthering public
              understanding of current research in science and technology.  The conference
              will bring together leading museum professionals, scientific researchers,
              science journalists, television producers, web developers and others who are
              already engaged in preliminary work for such an effort and who stand to learn
              from each other's experiences.  The conference will center on the role of
              museums in informing the public about research, but will include
              representatives from other media and institutions crucial to its success. 
                The specific goals of the conference are to:  Explore challenges and
              barriers that hinder the development of public understanding of research
              programs.  Identify "best practices" and promising models, tools and
              technologies for presenting current research to the public.  Develop
              partnership strategies for creating public understanding of research program
              collaborations across the museum, media and research communities.  Identify
              strategies for selecting significant research stories that are relevant to the
              public.  Develop funding strategies and operational approaches that help
              sustain a consistent public understanding of research effort.  The project
              will be under the direction of David Chittenden, Vice President for Education
              at the Science Museum of Minnesota.  Advisors to the project include:  Carol
              Lynn Alpert, Museum of Science, Boston; John Beatty, Distinguished Teaching
              Professor, University of Minnesota; Graham Farmelo, Head of Science
              Communications, Science Museum of London; Richard Hudson, Twin Cities Public
              Television, St. Paul; Ken Keller, Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public
              Affairs, University of Minnesota; Rob Semper, The Exploratorium; David Ucko,
              Koshland Science Center and Science Outreach, National Academy of Sciences; and
              Bonnie VanDorn, Executive Director, Association of Science-Technology
              Centers.
