Research at the Calhoun Experimental Forest has investigated
              rates and processes of soil biogeochemical change over four decades of
              forest-ecosystem development. From this work it is clear that soils are dynamic
              components of ecosystems remarkably responsive to ecosystem change.
              Continuation of this study by LTREB will allow continued testing of hypotheses
              and objectives that together will result in critical continuity for research
              development at this site. The three hypotheses concern: (1) the depletability
              and resupply of soil micronutrients over four decades of forest development,
              (2) soil SO4 and whether SO4 is decreasing in the last two decades in a pattern
              indicative of reduced air-pollution inputs, and (3) recent changes in soil and
              whole-ecosystem sequestration of C 14C, and N. Making this particularly
              compelling is the recent disturbance by bark beetles, ice and wind damage which
              together have decreased leaf area by as much as 50%, increasing litterfall
              inputs to the forest floor, and greatly accelerating growth of understory
              hardwoods. Because the Calhoun archive has nearly all soil samples collected
              since 1962, investigators have the ability to conduct retrospective analyses on
              soil and ecosystem biochemical change. The project also includes a program of
              educational outreach with undergraduate and high school science students, and
              data management improvements to expand the use of the Calhoun data for current
              and future researchers.
