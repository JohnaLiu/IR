This award supports Christopher Lynch and students from Georgia
              Tech in a collaboration with Juergen Roedel of the Department of Material at
              the Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany.  The aim of the international
              project is to design ferroelectric ceramics that are less brittle and more
              reliable than those used today.  This will require detailed knowledge of both
              the quasi-static and fatigue crack properties under both electrical and
              mechanical loading.  To improve the materials properties, the mechanisms of
              their failure have to be fully understood.  The US group has developed a finite
              element computer code capable of determining stress and electric field
              concentrations in ferroelectric materials.  The German group has developed
              experimental techniques and specialized fixtures for measuring the crack
              propagation behavior of brittle materials under combined electrical and
              mechanical loading.  By bringing together the strengths of both groups, new
              analytical techniques and new experimental techniques will make possible a full
              understanding of the fracture process in lead zirconate titanate (PZT), which
              in turn will elucidate the role of microstructure in the fracture process.  The
              work plan provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the
              international travel and research.
