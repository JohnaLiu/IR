Abstract    :
              The Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB) conference
              entitled "Post-Transcriptional Control of Gene Expression: Effectors of mRNA
              Decay" will be held July 6-11, 2002 in Tucson, Arizona.  The objective of this
              conference is to provide an opportunity for the cross-fertilization of ideas
              between workers studying mRNA decay in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  mRNA decay
              plays a major role in determining the level at which genes are expressed. 
              Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of mRNA degradation becomes very
              important to understanding how genes are regulated.  Among the topics planned
              for this conference are: (1) A keynote overview of mRNA decay at the start of
              the conference by Dr. Roy Parker (University of Arizona). (2) Multicomponent
              bacterial nucleases. (3) Multicomponent eukaroytic nucleases. (4) How mRNA
              transport and localization affect mRNA decay. (5) How translational accuracy
              affects mRNA decay, including how the premature termination of translation
              elicits mRNA decay. (6) Cis-acting mRNA sequences and their associated
              trans-acting factors that affect mRNA decay. (7) RNA as a tool and target for
              drug design.
