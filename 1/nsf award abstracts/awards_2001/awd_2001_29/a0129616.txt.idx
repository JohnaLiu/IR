Abstract    :
              0129616   Rob Jackson  The recent genome projects and the growth of molecular
              biology in general have had an enormous impact on the biological sciences at
              cellular and subcellular scales. While systematic and evolutionary biologists
              have been quick to incorporate molecular advances in their research, plant
              ecologists have only recently begun using such approaches to discern how
              populations, communities and ecosystems function.  This four-day workshop will
              bring together plant ecologists and molecular biologists to discuss ways to
              hasten the incorporation of molecular techniques into ecological studies and to
              foster interactions between the two groups.  The workshop will address
              opportunities for collaborations and two-way interactions between molecular
              biologists and plant ecologists, and will explore particular needs of
              ecologists that may require development of new molecular tools. It will address
              training needs for ecology graduate students applying molecular approaches to
              ecological questions.  The workshop will produce a joint publication that
              outlines specific ideas and methods for increasing the use of molecular
              approaches in ecological research.
