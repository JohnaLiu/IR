This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in chemical
              and thermal systems involves researchers and students at Iowa State University
              and the University of Rouen in France.  Rodney O Fox and Pascale Domingo lead
              the US and French efforts respectively.  Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
              macroscopic models for liquid-phase turbulent reacting flows will be studied. 
              Such models have potential for improving process design in the chemical process
              industry.  The research addresses the utility of CFD models for reducing
              pollution and toxic byproducts caused by poor product selectivity.  The
              collaboration's focus is code development and validation, and detailed
              simulations for experiments conducted on the Iowa State planar-jet reactor. 
              The US research group will obtain data for a well-defined reactor geometry
              using particle-image velocimetry and planar laser-induced fluorescence.  This
              will be complemented by the French group's studies of direct numerical
              simulations and large-eddy simulations of flow statistics that cannot easily be
              measured with the techniques used by the Iowa State group.
 
This award
              represents the US side of joint proposals to the NSF and the French National
              Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living
              expenses of the US investigators and students.  The CNRS will support visits to
              the US of the French participants. The collaboration will produce a set of
              detailed data for CFD model validation of liquid-phase chemical reactors.
