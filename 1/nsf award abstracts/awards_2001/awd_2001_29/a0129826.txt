Abstract    :
              Based on the theoretical framework of human behavioral ecology, this research
              will examine the importance of community-level variation in food sharing
              patterns, and the relationship between intra-community sharing and
              extra-community trading of meat resources. The importance of household-level
              factors in food sharing patterns has been investigated previously, but little
              attention has been given to differences among communities. Therefore, this
              research focuses on the contextual variation across two different Huaorani
              communities located within the same region of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and the
              role that this community-level variation has in predicting food sharing
              patterns. The PI, a graduate student in anthropology from the University of
              California at Davis, will investigate the hypotheses that 1) contextual
              differences between the two communities influence the extent of intra-community
              food sharing observed, and 2) the degree of intra-community sharing and the
              degree of extra-community trading are inversely related. Contextual factors to
              be considered include community layout, relatedness of households, and
              potential reproductive opportunities. Data will be collected through direct
              observation and structured interviews. In addition to providing doctoral
              training for a promising woman scientist, the research will contribute to
              understanding the potential impact of indigenous people's participation in
              market economies on local wildlife conservation.
