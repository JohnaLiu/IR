Abstract    :
              Funds are requested to partially support U.S. researchers to attend the
              international workshop on underwater robotics for sea exploration and
              environmental monitoring.  The workshop will be held in Rio de Janero, Brazil,
              September 2001.

The objective of the proposal is to provide an opportunity
              for U.S. researchers to participate in conference that will bring together
              experts as well as young researchers in the theory and applications of advanced
              robotics.  The range of application areas include space, underwater, nuclear,
              tunneling, agriculture, medical and healthcare, civil engineering and
              construction, manufacturing and other applications.  The conference program
              consists of plenary lectures, invited papers as well as contributed papers.
