Abstract    :
              0129022	 Hupp  Temperate river systems and their associated floodplains have
              been substantially altered by human activity.  Although the effects of dams on
              river hydrology and downstream ecosystems have been studied extensively, data
              on how changes in historic sedimentation regimes and geomorphology affect
              floodplain ecosystems is practically nonexistent.  This research will
              demonstrate for an entire model river system (the Roanoke River of North
              Carolina) the degree of post-colonial landscape-scale ecosystem alteration due
              to sediment deposition, and the future changes likely to affect vegetation
              dynamics as those sediments are redistributed and transported out of the
              system.  We will test a series of specific hypotheses centered on the
              following: (1) Anthropogenic sediment deposition on the Roanoke River
              floodplain over the last 250 years has led to a dramatic alteration of the
              extent and distribution of landforms within the geomorphologic system; (2) The
              vegetation of the lower Roanoke floodplain has been substantially altered as a
              consequence of environmental changes due to geomorphic alterations from
              post-colonial sedimentation; (3) Models of sediment-impacted riparian areas
              developed from geomorphologic and paleoecological data can be used to predict
              future landforms and vegetation composition.  To address these hypotheses we
              will integrate dendrogeomorphic, palynological and modeling techniques to (1)
              develop a spatially explicit model of post-colonial sediment accumulation for
              the lower Roanoke River floodplain, (2) model the pre-colonial geomorphic
              landscape and simulate future floodplain geomorphology, and (3) predict
              vegetation distributions for those surfaces using vegetation-environment
              relationships.
