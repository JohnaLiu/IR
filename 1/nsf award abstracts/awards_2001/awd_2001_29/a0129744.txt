Abstract    :
              
	This project uses functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to investigate
              biologically plausible brain mechanisms that produce economic behavior. 
              Traditionally experiments in economics have taken place either in the field,
              where individual behavior can be observed before and after a treatment variable
              has been manipulated, or in behavioral laboratories where, in addition, there
              is greater control over incentives, information, and the rules of the game. 
              The purpose of such experimentation is to better understand both the behavioral
              mechanisms that produce particular types of behavior, such as investor
              overconfidence in 'bull' markets, and the resulting behavior of markets, such
              as price bubbles.  While a great deal of progress has been made in
              understanding market behavior very little progress has been made in
              understanding individual behavior.  Recent advances in functional brain imaging
              now makes it possible for economists and neuroscientists to collaborate to
              study how brain activity is linked to economic decision making.  This project
              studies how the human brain is genetically designed, and environmentally
              influenced, to solve the problem of mutually advantageous cooperation. This
              research is likely to have a significant impact on economic thought, and
              institutional design, by linking observed economic behavior to the biological
              mechanisms that produce this behavior.
