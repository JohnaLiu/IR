Abstract    :
              This grant provides partial support for a Chapman Conference that is intended to
              bring together volcanologists, geophysicists, and marine geoscientists with
              interests in the formation of clastic volcanologic successions of the modern
              seafloor and in ancient successions, and in the processes and significance of
              explosive subaqueous eruptions in seafloor settings.
