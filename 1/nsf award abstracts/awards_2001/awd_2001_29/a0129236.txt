This award supports Peter Tandy and students from Kent State
              University in a collaboration with Reinhard Alkofer of the Department of
              Theoretical Physics at the University of Tuebingen, Germany.  The project
              focuses on hadronic processes in terms of confined quarks and gluons by
              bringing together two presently disparate lines of investigation.  The US side
              has expertise in continuum nonperturbative QCD modeling of hadrons using the
              Dyson-Schwinger equations.  To be useful, the results must be packaged in the
              form of model solutions of the gauge sector Dyson-Schwinger equations for at
              least the gluon and ghost-dressed propagators and the gluon-quark vertex.  This
              is exactly the expertise of the German group.  They have recently produced the
              most advanced solutions of truncat4ed forms of the gauge sector Dyson-Schwinger
              equations and have found unexpected behavior that relates to the origin of
              quark confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking.  The project has the
              potential to impact the search for quark-gluon plasma, nuclear astrophysics,
              early universe cosmology, and strongly interacting field theory.  The work plan
              provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the international
