Abstract    :
              	This proposal seeks preliminary support for development of a fully detailed
              workshop/symposium proposal on the highly theoretically interesting (and
              contested) question of how the institutional context of contemporary China has
              fostered robust economic development over the past several decades despite what
              traditional theory would suggest is "a recipe for failure." Contemporary China
              is certainly moving slowly toward a more market-centered economy, apparently
              despite the absence of well-established guarantees of private property and
              freedom, of reliable financial markets and ownership guarantees and an
              independent judiciary (among other factors). Meanwhile, a growing body of work
              on economic development, technology transfer and commercialization,
              international strategic alliances and other topics creates a relevant backdrop
              against which scholars conversant with the Chinese experience and with such
              data as can be accessed, cries out for integration. This Small Grant for
              Exploratory Research is recommended to facilitate the development of funding to
              support new approaches to the established topics of institutional contexts
              favoring economic development; to take advantage of the availability of the
              presence of Chinese scholars now resident in North America as well as in China
              and of well-established U.S. scholars familiar with the Chinese development
              context; and most particularly to catalyze discussion around this important
              issue at an especially opportune time, exploring the potential for integrating
              China into the emerging global economy. It is anticipated that the PI will
              submit a full proposal subsequently, building on the initial inquiries funded
              by the present SGER.
