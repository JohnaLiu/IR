This is a workshop proposal submitted by Dr. Raymond Russo,
              Northwestern University, and Dr. Martin Flower, the University of Illinois, to
              request travel expenses to enable 15 U.S. scientists to attend workshop on
              collision-related mantle flow fields beneath East and Southeast Asia.  The
              meeting will be held in Halong Bay, Vietnam, from January 6-16, 2002.   The
              topic of the workshop is important for earth sciences and for understanding the
              India-Eurasia plate collision, which is the largest continental collision in
              the world.  The proposed list of participants is impressive, including younger,
              women and minority scientists from U.S. institutes, and represents many earth
              science disciplines.  Participation in this workshop by U.S. scientists will
              likely result in a number of new collaborative studies between the U.S. and
              Vietnamese scientists.  The NSF and the Geological Survey of Vietnam jointly
              support this workshop.
