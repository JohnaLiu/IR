Abstract    :
              Systemic Research, Inc. proposes to conduct a 24-month evaluative study (from
              October 2001 to September 2003). During the initial phase,  comprehensive
              secondary data collection will be conducted from various sources, including
              past Core Data Elements (CDE) reports, Annual Reports submitted to NSF, other
              key indicators obtainable from the RSIs' own web sites and relevant rural
              project reports. Systemic Research will develop a Rural Key Indicator Database
              (RKID) to organize both quantitative and qualitative longitudinal achievement
              databases over the project period of individual RSI sites. The study team will
              conduct two site visits each year to confirm reform implementation and to write
              relevant case stories based on observation. Based on completed RKID, both
              quantitative and qualitative data analysis will be performed to explore an
              inferential causal model. Study results will be disseminated in
              three publications: a two volume Rural Key Indicators of Science and
              Mathematics Education (Volume I for individual RSI progress report and Volume
              II for overall RSI progress reports); a rural education report in booklet
              format; and a RSI Evaluative Study Report including case stories of the four
              sites that were visited. All publications will be available in three different
              formats-- printed copy, CD-ROM, and web-based publication.
