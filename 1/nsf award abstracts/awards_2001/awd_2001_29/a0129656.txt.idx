Abstract    :
              The Educational Broadcasting Corporation (WNET) is researching and testing an
              experimental, short format television broadcast and Web project entitled,
              "Science InSight."  The goal of this experimental research is to determine if
              short-format television segments can successfully increase Americans'
              understanding of and interest in new research in science and technology and, if
              they can, which of several possible formats is likely to be most successful. 
              During this research and development phase, WNET will test the viability of the
              project model and develop and refine the model for use in a selected group of
              media venues such as the forthcoming PBS weekly public affairs program, "Public
              Square."  The specific activities to be undertaken in the research phase
              include:  assembling an expert board of up to six advisors with expertise in
              science, science journalism and media;  producing three experimental,
              short-format, "program concept" video segments of varying lengths for use as
              science information pieces in other media programs;  conducting formal and
              informal testing and evaluation of these test formats for appeal, credibility,
              clarity, and comprehensibility of style and content; and   identifying
              additional key potential distribution partners from television media, print,
              Web and science centers outlets.
