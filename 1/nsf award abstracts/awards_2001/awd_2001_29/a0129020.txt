This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in
              atomic, molecular and optical physics involves Thomas Gallager, Pierre Pillet
              and graduate students at the University of Virginia and the Laboratoire Aime
              Cotton in Orsay, France respectively.  The goal is to use cold Rydberg gases as
              a controllable test system for several different kinds of experiments.  Cold
              Rydberg atoms mimic an amorphous solid, the properties of which can be
              manipulated using small tuning electric fields or by changing the Rydberg
              state. This cooperative research program will explore collectively this
              phenomena in cold Rydberg atom samples, the Rydberg to plasma evolution, and
              dipole-dipole interactions in frozen Rydberg gases. The main questions
              addressed are:  How does ultracold plasma containing cold atoms in a
              well-defined Rydberg state come to equilibrium?  What key role do dipole-dipole
              interactions play in quantum logic gates?   The French group brings to this
              collaboration expertise in high-resolution laser spectroscopy and cold atom
              manipulation.  This is complemented by US expertise in manipulation of Rydberg
              atoms.  

This award represents the US side of joint proposals to the NSF and
              the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover
              travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and graduate students.
               CNRS will support the visits of the French researchers and graduate students
              to the United States. The collaboration will advance fundamental understanding
              of the atomic-solid state connection in cold Rydberg gases and this phenomena's
              applications in plasma and condensed matter physics.
