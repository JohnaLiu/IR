Abstract    :
              A symposium will be organized in conjunction with the opening of Michael Frayn's
              play "Copenhagen" in its four-week run in Washington, currently scheduled for
              February 26, 2002 through March 24, 2002. The play reenacts possible events
              associated with an actual 1941 meeting between Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr
              in Nazi-occupied Denmark.  The symposium will seek to ensure and expand the
              involvement of the general public and students in the science and drama of the
              play. There is a need to engage and inform the general public in the
              understanding and appreciation of science, scientists and the impact of science
              on our daily lives.  The play Copenhagen, perhaps more than any science-based
              play, involves the audience in an understanding of the impact of the new
              physics.  The symposium will be held about a week before the play opening and
              consists of three parts: 1- The Science and History Surrounding Copenhagen
              focused on the science in Copenhagen, and its modern day impact. 2- An
              Understanding of the Characters of the Play, with speakers who knew the three
              characters in the play, (Bohr, his wife Margrethe and Heisenberg) and.
              3-Deconstructing Copenhagen, with the playwright, theater critics, writers and
              journalists examining the construction and dramatic elements of the play. The
              audience for the symposium is the general public with a strong emphasis on
              students.  The impact of the symposium and the associate colloquia and seminars
              will extend well beyond the attendees through wide interest by the local press
              including, TV, radio and print. The extended colloquia and discussions will
              encourage debates and interdisciplinary learning opportunities by including the
              sciences (physics), the humanities (history), and the arts (theater).
