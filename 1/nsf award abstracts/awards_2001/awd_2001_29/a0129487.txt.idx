Abstract    :
              Dr. Scott Edwards, an African American evolutionary biologist, will use this
              Minority Career Advancement Award to supplement salary and provide laboratory
              supplies during a sabbatical year from September 2001 to June 2002.  September
              to March 2002 will be spent at the Australian National University in Canberra,
              where collaborative studies on the evolution of sex chromosomes in snakes and
              birds will be conducted.  The principal investigator will use the technique of
              fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) to determine whether genes that
              influence sex determination in mammals and reside on the mammal Y chromosome
              are located on the sex chromosomes of birds and snakes.  This research will
              provide a useful comparison to the genetic patterns found on mammalian sex
              chromosomes and will help us understand how genes determine the sex of
              vertebrate species.  From March to June 2002 Dr. Edwards will undertake
              immunological research at the Institute for Animal Health in Compton, United
              Kingdom, in order to develop tools to monitor the immune response of birds in
              the wild.  The ability to monitor the avian immune response will ultimately be
              useful for measuring the importance for disease resistance for modulating the
              reproductive performance, or fitness, of individuals of a variety of species.
