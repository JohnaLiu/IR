Viruses infecting
              bacteria and algae are generally the most abundant microorganisms in aquatic
              environments, and are known to influence microbial community structure,
              function, and biogeochemical cycling. Although the importance of viruses in
              typical marine and freshwater environments is recognized, almost nothing is
              known about their roles in alkaline hypersaline environments.  Preliminary
              observations from Mono Lake, where pH is ~10 and salt content nearly three
              times that of seawater, indicate that viruses are near the highest
              concentrations ever observed in nature.  Mono Lake supports a relatively simple
              food web with high phytoplankton production, brine shrimp acting as the sole
              macrozooplankton grazer, and permanent stratification shaping the structure of
              the microbial community.  Three basic questions are addressed in this research.
               How does viral abundance, dynamics, and diversity differ in this unusual
              environment from those in marine and freshwater environments?  What is the
              contribution of viruses to host mortality?   How are the viruses in this
              seeting different from other viruses in terms of genetic and physiological
              properties?   Viral density and diversity will be ascertained using viral
              isolates as well as direct molecular approaches.  This research complements
              ongoing activities at the Lake Mono Microbial Observatory, and facilitates an
              integrated study of the viral community in a broad biotic and abiotic context. 
              Results will provide new insights into the occurrence, diversity and function
              of microbiological life forms extreme environments.  The project also provides
              opportunities to educate graduate and undergraduate students in environmental
              and microbiological sciences.
