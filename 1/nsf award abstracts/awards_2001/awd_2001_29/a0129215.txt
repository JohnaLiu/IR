This three-year award supports US-France collaboration in
              economics between Simon Anderson of the University of Virginia and Regis
              Renault of the University of Caen.  The objective of their research is to
              develop an economic theory of the content of advertising and explore incentives
              used by firms regarding the amount and nature of information they provide in
              advertisements.  They will construct a model to demonstrate the relationship
              between the amount of information revealed by a firm about its products and
              corresponding market performance.  The US and French researchers have
              complementary expertise in economics.  They collaborated previously on research
              on firm pricing in the context of consumer search for prices and product
              matches.  This collaboration extends this initial research into new areas. The
              research will advance understanding about economic and social impact of
              advertising on firms, purchasing, product pricing and on the public
              respectively.
 
This award represents the US side of parallel proposals to
              the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF
              will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator.  The CNRS
              will support visits by the French researcher to the United States.
