Abstract    :
              WGBH is conducting research and testing an innovative science magazine
              television series dedicated to the public understanding of research.  The show
              will present both breaking research news and reports on underlying trends and
              issues in science.  It will also feature stories that follow experiments or lab
              work over extended periods, profiles of scientists, stories of invention and
              discovery, and more purely entertaining items.  The project places strong
              emphasis on a collaborative approach with other media developers, notably web
              and museum exhibit designers, to deepen the impact of the show beyond its
              immediate broadcast.    During the research phase, WGBH will convene a group
              of scientists, informal educators and other potential collaborators to
              investigate the parameters involved in a collaborative approach.  They also
              will produce and test sample program segments to determine what formats may be
              most effective.  In addition, WGBH will begin looking for on-camera talent who
              has the knowledge and presentation ability to carry such a program. The
              questions that will be examined in the research phase include:   how research
              and production efforts can be coordinated across different media,  how
              facilities and infrastructure might be shared among different organizations
              providing public     information about research,  how the new television
              format might be customized to allow local television stations and science
              centers to      link it with local events, and    what formats may be most
              effective in engaging the public, holding their interest over multiple
              programs,     and conveying substantive information about research.
