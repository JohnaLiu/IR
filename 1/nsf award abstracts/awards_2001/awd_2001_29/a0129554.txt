Abstract    :
              The proposed workshop is a follow-up activity to a pilot effort funded by the
              EHR/REC as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) in FY 2000 that
              focused on evaluator capacity building and the importance of cultural context
              in conducting evaluations. This proposal builds on the strategies and
              activities implemented in the pilot workshop and will incorporate lessons
              learned and feedback from the pilot workshop participants.

Major objectives
              for this workshop would be to provide participants with:
1. an introduction to
              the role and importance of program evaluation in urban school
settings
2. a
              general overview of major evaluation theories/approaches that have defined the
              field
of educational evaluation
3. a closer look at a few emerging evaluation
              theories/approaches that accept cultural
context as an important factor in
              program evaluation.
4. preliminary considerations of culturally responsive
              approaches in the design and
implementation of program evaluations.
5. A
              videotape and accompanying CD of the workshop will be developed by a
              professional
media company for use in future professional development
              workshops and recruitment. The
workshop participants and evaluation
              facilitators will receive copies of the videotape and
CD.
