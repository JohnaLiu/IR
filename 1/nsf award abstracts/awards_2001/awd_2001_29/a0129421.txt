Abstract    :
              This project will conduct a five-year study on the scale up of complex
              instructional innovations.  The PIs construe scale up to mean both widespread
              adoption and high quality implementation.  Using three large whole-school
              projects-Success for All, America's Choice, and Accelerated Schools, the
              project will examine two issues:

1. To what extent do design and
              environmental factors influence attempts to bring high-quality implementations
              of educational innovations to large numbers of schools?

2. How do the
              designs and educational environments affect the problems of scaling up, and how
              do interventions and implementers manage these problems?
