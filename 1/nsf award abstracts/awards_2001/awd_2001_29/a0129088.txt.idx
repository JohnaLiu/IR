Abstract    :
              The goal of our project is to develop a novel integrated engineering simulation
              tool for heat conduction in microelectronic and microphotonic components -
              microscale systems with nanoscale features.  The global impact of this work
              will be to quantify, tabulate and disseminate phonon properties, which are as
              important for heat conduction in these devices as properties such as emissivity
              and extinction coefficient for thermal radiation in the classical regime. 
              Novel molecular dynamics (MD) simulations will be used to quantify and
              parameterize phonon relaxation times and phonon-interface phenomena.  Given the
              phonon data obtained through MD simulations, a new ballistic-diffusive
              formulation of the Boltzmann equation will enable the solution of realistically
              complex thermal problems from nano- to macroscales.  A modular design of our
              implementation will facilitate an eventual integration into design
              software.  The results from the projects will be applied for the development
              of Information technology systems.   These are constructed from devices and
              components with characteristic length scales ranging from nanometers to
              micrometers, such as semiconductor lasers and heterojunction bipolar
              transistors used in telecommunication systems.  Currently, the thermal design
              of such micro- and nanoscale components is major challenge because Fourier's
              law fails at these scales due to the long mean free path of phonons (the
              dominant heat carriers in most semiconductor devices) and there exists no
              practical alternative.  Revised Title:   ITR:  Collaborative Research on the
              Development of an Integrated Algorithm for Heat Conduction form Nano- to
              Macroscale
