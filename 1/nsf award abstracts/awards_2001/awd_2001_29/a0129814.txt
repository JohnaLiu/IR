	The proposed project is a Small Grant for Exploratory
              Research (SGER) which will take advantage of a cruise of the Australian
              icebreaker RSV Aurora Australis in October 2001 to investigate the
              concentration of biologically active iron in the sea ice and its snow cover. 
              Sea ice acts as a natural depository for wind-borne dust, but there is
              currently no reliable information on the magnitude of this source of iron for
              the production of phytoplankton in the upper layers of the Southern Ocean. 
              Simple flux calculations suggest that this may be the dominant source, and up
              to three times as large as all other sources combined.  The objective of this
              research is to evaluate both the concentration and bioavailability of iron in
              the seasonal sea ice of  the Southern Ocean south of Australia.  Sample data,
              when combined with other sea ice observations and sea ice drift models will
              greatly enhance our knowledge of antarctic iron biogeochemistry.
