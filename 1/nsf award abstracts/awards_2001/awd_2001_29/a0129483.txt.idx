Abstract    :
              The purpose of this workshop is to gather for the fourth time, a diverse group
              of leading researchers in solid state technology, devices, circuits, and system
              architectures to:  Assess the change in the knowledge base since
              1999  Interact in an open discussion and free exchange of ideas across the
              broad spectrum of communication/information processing technology  Identify
              areas on the research frontiers that extend communication/information
              processing progress into the 21 st Century and beyond shrink
              limitation  Establish a communication link between researchers from around
              the world from different disciplines and backgrounds for a fruitful exchange
              of experiences and ideas  As the cost and performance factors of
              microelectronic devices improve through advances in technology, novel and/or
              improved information/communication systems are enabled. Conversely, new
              concepts for information/communications applications often create a demand for
              more advanced microelectronics technologies that offer unique capabilities. As
              an example, the need for mobility has driven the creation of high performance,
              low power, microelectronic devices used in portable electronic assistants
              with communication capabilities  The objective of the 4th IWFIPT is to
              examine the push and pull between microelectronics technology and emerging
              application areas to obtain a sense of future technology trends and
              capabilities. Leading contributors will describe their views on hardware
              performance and functionalities needed in the information society of the
              future. These projections will be juxtaposed with anticipated trends
              in microelectronics and with potential ioradical technologiesli arising from
              advances in carbon-based materials, quantum physics, molecular nanotechnology
              and other areas. A synthesis of views is planned to identify trend feeding,
              trend fighting and trend setting microelectronic technologies that are likely
              to emerge over the next few decades.
