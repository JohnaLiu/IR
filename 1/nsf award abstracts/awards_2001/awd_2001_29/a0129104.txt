Abstract    :
              At a global scale, soil carbon storage generally increases with clay content,
              and carbon loss via soil respiration can be relatively well predicted from mean
              annual temperature and rainfall.  At an ecosystem scale, the mechanisms
              responsible for C retention and loss are less well understood.  This study will
              use a long-term and well-replicated pasture-to-forest chronosequence to study
              the factors that contribute to soil C storage and loss.  The research will
              follow C from plant litter inputs through decomposition to storage in soils,
              and loss via CO2.  Chemical properties of plant tissues change during secondary
              succession, and thus the impact of the litter chemistry on ecosystem processes
              is also likely to change over time.  The research will use field and laboratory
              experiments and stable- and radioisotopes to compare and contrast the roles of
              litter chemistry, above- and belowground litter inputs, and soil chemical
              properties in belowground C cycling over 82 yr of reforestation.  This research
              will contribute to understanding of how plants influence soil C dynamics, and
              improve the ability to predict the effects of reforestation and afforestation
              on C sequestration.
