Abstract    :
              Today's Solutions in partnership with the Girl Scouts-Lone Star Council are
              using a planning grant to build a strong regional and national collaboration
              with Texas community colleges and five additional Girl Scout councils. The
              Council is building on a technology curriculum project pilot called "The Edge."
              The original pilot program was developed for girls ages 6-17 and delivered
              primarily to elementary and middle school girls. The plan is to modify "The
              Edge" to address the needs of high school age girls, undergraduate women and
              women desiring an entry level technology job. The large project will focus on
              those in rural Texas counties, girls within the 200% of poverty level and girls
              that have English as a second language, to increase their technology skills and
              their interest in going to college. 

Austin Community College distance
              learning, St. Edward's University, University of Texas and the IC2 institute
              are eager to partner with Girl Scouts - Lone Star Council . The Council served
              12,839 girls and 6,598 adults in fiscal year 99-00.
