Abstract    :
              	Most natural infections contain multiple viruses, and this has
important
              consequences for virus evolution.  On the one hand, viruses
can swap genes
              during co-infection, creating variability that allows
rapid virus evolution. 
              On the other hand, increased competition between
viruses can occur during
              co-infection, slowing the rate of virus
evolution.  This suggests a compromise
              where viruses evolve to restrict
the numbers that enter a cell (to decrease
              competition) without reducing
the number to one (to achieve gene exchange). 
              Given the widespread
occurrence of virus co-infection, it is surprising that
              the costs and
benefits of this phenomenon are virtually unexplored.  The focus
              of this
project is to address the question using viruses that infect
              bacteria.
Laboratory experiments will examine the evolution of virus traits
              that
control co-infection numbers, and molecular analyses will determine
              the
genetic changes responsible.
	The results of this project can be applied
              to several systems
because viruses are important disease agents in animals,
              plants, and
bacteria.  Because the life cycle of the project virus is similar
              to
that of many human viruses (such as influenza and HIV), the project
              data
should contribute greatly to a better understanding of the
              generalized
role of virus co-infection in human illnesses.
