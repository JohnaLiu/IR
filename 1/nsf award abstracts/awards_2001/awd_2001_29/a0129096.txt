The PI
              proposes exploratory research aimed at solving a perpetual transportation
              design problem - the automated and efficient measurement of available sight
              distance for three-dimensional highway alignments. This is an important problem
              in its own right because of the growing need to automate design feasibility
              test and evaluation for highways due to workforce reductions. Automation is
              thwarted by the computational complexity of the problems. If successful,
              research the results will be a more efficient algorithmic to the sight distance
              problem and improved highway design evaluation, selection and safety. This will
              have a  significant impact on the transportation community, including
              universities, public and private agencies such as roadway construction and
              maintenance, traffic operations, safety. Additionally the mathematical
              framework required to solve the problem can support a number of other
              investigations, such as clear zone widths, passing lane demarcations, etc.
