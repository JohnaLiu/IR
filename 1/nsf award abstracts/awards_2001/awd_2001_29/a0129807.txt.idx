Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, addresses the formation mechanisms of self-assembled monolayer thin
              films.  Professor Daniel Schwartz and his group at the University of Colorado
              use a combination of methods to examine the detailed microscopic mechanism of
              monolayer growth, including two and three dimensional transport of molecules,
              the structure of the growing film, and the aggregation of molecules in the
              layer.  Scanning probe microscopy is used to monitor the morphology of the
              growing monolayer, and reflection absorption infrared and X-ray scattering
              methods are used to provide molecular structure information.  Phosphonic,
              sulfonic and carboxylic acid monolayers growing on mica and sapphire substrates
              are examined under a systematic variation of growth conditions.  The overall
              goal of the research is to develop a detailed and quantitative model of the
              formation of self-assembled monolayers from solution.    Organic thin films
              have important applications in material surface modification and as models for
              biological membrane systems.  The detailed understanding of the mechanisms of
              growth of these self-assembled monolayer materials is the goal of this research
              project.  With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, the
              goal of this research project is to obtain molecular level information about
              the growth of a range of molecular acid monolayers on oxide substrates, and to
              develop a detailed model of the growth process.  The results of this research
              will be useful in the understanding of these technologically important model
              systems, and in their subsequent design and application for the modification of
              material surfaces.
