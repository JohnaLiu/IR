OCE-0129555

A principal investigator from the University of
              Southern California will take advantage of two cutting-edge technologies for an
              investigation of benthic organic carbon cycling.  Initially, the PI will create
              oxygen profiles utilizing genetically engineered bacteria (Shewanella sp.)
              which can be modified to perform carbon oxidation using either oxygen, or
              manganese oxide, or any combination of electron acceptors.  Using these
              bacteria will allow the PI to construct oxygen profiles with control over
              organic substrate type/distribution, oxidant availability/distribution and
              bacterial community abundance/distribution.  The goal of this research is to
              provide a direct relationship between solute profiles observed in sediments and
              the type and abundance of bacteria needed to carry out the redox reactions to
              yield a given profile.  In addition, the PI also will use a profiling X-ray
              fluorescence scanner in collaboration with a scientist from Germany, to
              determine Fe, Ca, Mn and Ti in laminated sediments from low-oxygen-sites off
              Southern California and Mexico at 2-3 mm intervals or 3-6 years of resolution. 
              The objective of this study is to obtain high resolution images of changes in
              solid phase Fe, Mn and Ti and carbonate as a function of time to identify
              diagenetic fronts and interpret changes in ocean productivity.
