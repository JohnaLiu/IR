This award supports Joanna Groza and students from the
              University of California-Davis in a collaboration with Eberhart Burkel of the
              Department of Physics at the University of Rostock, Germany.  The aim of the
              international project is to study field-activated sintering of nanopowders,
              which occurs under exposure to microdischarges.  Technologically, electric
              field application has distinct benefits, such as enhanced sintering rates,
              sontrol and production of novel microstructures, and fewer processing steps. 
              The US group has an ongoing research program which has already achieved results
              on difficult-to-sinter materials.  The German group is a leader in the
              development and improvement of new synchrotron radiation ingvestigation using
              inelastic scattering of synchrotron radiation with very high resolution.  The
              research will advace our knowledge of field-assisted sintiering, particularly
              as applied to nanosized powders..  The work plan provides for extensive
              participation by graduate students in the international travel and research,
              the work is intended to offer insights into science and engineering education
              and prepare the students to work in an increasingly interdependent global
              economy.
