Abstract    :
              The development of sea-ice parameterizations for use in general circulation
              models (GCMs) has historically been characterized by a focus on increasing the
              complexity of the parameterization.  Currently, ice model development has
              involved adding previously un-represented or under-represented physics, such as
              melt ponds, ice ridging, etc.  Increased physical complexity, however, is not
              the core issue in the GCM parameterization.  In the case of parameterizing
              moist convection, parameterization is the link between that which provides a
              "control" upon the physical process being parameterized and the "feedback" the
              physical process provides. With sea-ice parameterizations, there does not
              currently appear to be an adequate understanding of how the large and
              small-scales interact.  What the large-scale ultimately cares about, both a
              control and as a recipient of feedback, is not the microscale physical behavior
              per se, but rather what the parameterized process dynamically accomplishes. 
              Preliminary work in adding a stochastic parameterization for winter leads to
              the ARCSyM Arctic regional climate model suggests that climate sensitivity to
              ice processes lies fundamentally in how the ice couples with large-scale
              atmosphere dynamics, and not so much in the ice model itself. In this project,
              very small perturbations to ice concentration can result in melting of nearly
              half of the January ice pack, and also appear to affect the development and
              evolution of synoptic cyclones. Since the sea-ice model reasonably emulates
              mean ice extent, the coupled model 's sensitivity appears due to ice-atmosphere
              interactions and feedbacks.
