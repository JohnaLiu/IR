In this
              exploratory project the PI and Co-PI will focus on creating a series of
              branched amphiphilic block copolymers and investigating how their assembly,
              organization and structure are different than brushes formed form linear
              polymers.

In order to maximize the productivity during this one-year
              exploratory project, the synthesis efforts will focus three types of
              architectures.  The PI and Co-PI will synthesize comb-block, star-block
              copolymers and make proof-of-concept syntheses of A2A'B and A3A'B copolymers. 
              The A2A'B and A3A'B copolymers are novel materials. 

In terms of
              characterization, the PI and Co-PI will focus on two key techniques:  They will
              use the surface forces apparatus (SFA) to investigate the structure of brushes
              made from the aforementioned materials; they will also investigate the surface
              morphology and organization using atomic force microscopy (AFM).  The former
              technique will focus on the layers as they are assembled from a selective
              solvent, and the latter technique will examine dried layers after the assembly
              process. The focus here is to explore how the connectivity and size of the new,
              branched polymers affects the organization and structure of the brush
              layer.

This is an Exploratory/GOALI grant in which the PI and Co-PI will
              collaborate with Dr. Victor P. Thalacker, Senior Laboratory Manager at 3M
              Corporate Process Technology Center in St. Paul, Minnesota.
