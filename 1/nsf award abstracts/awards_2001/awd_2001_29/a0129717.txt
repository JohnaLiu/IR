Abstract    :
              This Advanced Training Institute in Social Psychology  will provide intensive
              training in the use of immersive virtual environment technology as a
              methodological tool for social psychology. Institute Fellows will receive
              appropriate methodological, technology, software, and data collection training
              to enable them to use state-of-the-art immersive virtual technology to perform
              social psychology experiments. The advanced training institutes will take place
              during summers at the Research Center for Virtual Environments and Behavior at
              the University of California, Santa Barbara.
