This award supports Cila Herman and students from the Johns
              Hopkins University to collaborate with Dieter Mewes of the Institute for
              Chemical Engineering at the University of Hannover, Germany.  The project will
              focus on the use of electric fields to influence bubble formation as well as
              boiling in terrestrial and microgravity conditions.  While both the German and
              US investigators have experience in optical measurement techniques, they now
              intend to collaborate in the new area of electrohydrodynamic control of bubble
              formation and motion.  The new technique may has potential for achieving better
              control over bubble formation and for increasing the amount of heat that can be
              transferred from a surface.  An understanding of the mechanisms of bubble
              break-up under the influence of electric fields holds the promise of being able
              to control bubble size in two-phase flow systems and could have great benefits
              to the proper design of phase-change and two-phase flow systems.  The work plan
              provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the international
              travel and research.
