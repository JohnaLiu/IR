Arge
This award supports Lars Arge and graduate students from Duke
              University in a collaboration with Jan Vahrenhold of the Department of Computer
              Science at the University of Muenster.  The project will focus on bridging the
              gap between theory and practice of spatial database algorithms research, where
              there still exists a large gap between theory and practice in algorithms for
              massive spatial databases.  Often, theoretically efficient algorithms are too
              complicated to be of practical use, while theoretically inefficient algorithms
              often perform well on most real-life data sets.  Theoretical developments,
              however, have also led to tremendous runtime improvements.  Because spatial
              databases, especially geographic information systems, have emerged as extremely
              powerful management and analysis tools in science and engineering, this work is
              likely to lead to new algorithms that will benefit scientists, engineers, and
              other spatial database users.  The collaboration supported here will bring
              together experimentalists and theorists in a way that will significantly
              advance the field of nuclear fission.
