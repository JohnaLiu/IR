	This study is designed to investigate how
              carnivores, nutrients, and fire affect grassland communities.  Previous studies
              have shown that these three factors are important for determining the
              population sizes of many different animals and the growth of plants in
              grasslands.  However, how these processes interact with each other is not well
              understood.  This study is also designed to compare small isolated grassland
              communities in Arkansas to those larger, more well studied tallgrass prairies
              in the Great Plains of North America.  The grasslands of the Great Plains have
              many similarities with my field sites, including similar plant species and
              frequent disturbance by fire.  However, my field sites lack (and historically
              lacked) large mammal herbivores such as bison.   This study will therefore help
              determine if the results of studies on the tallgrass prairies apply to other
              grassland systems.
	Proper management of grasslands is important as these
              systems have been drastically altered by human activity and often contain rare
              and declining species.  This study will address what factors affect the
              abundance and diversity of life in grasslands and will therefore provide
              information as to the proper human management of these systems.  Some of the
              research will take place on state owned lands with public access and will help
              with both management and education of the public.  This project will also
              provide support for numerous undergraduate research projects furthering the
              educational goals of the National Science Foundation.
