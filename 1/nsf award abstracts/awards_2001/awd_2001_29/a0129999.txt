Abstract    :
              This action is to support a field survey of the effects of the tsunami generated
              by the Southern Peru earthquake of 23 June 2001.  The survey involves a
              9-person team for a total of nine days in the area impacted by the tsunami. 
              The objective is to gather a coherent database of runup and inundation
              measurements, to be used later in computer modeling efforts aimed at unraveling
              the exact mechanism of generation of this tsunami.

Preliminary reports
              indicate that a tsunami was generated and recorded as far away as Japan. 
              Locally, reports indicate a series of five waves (with periods on the order of
              half-an-hour) destroying built-up structures and inundating as far as 1.5 to 2
              km inland in the area of Camana.

This survey represents a continuation of
              the work carried out for the past decade in the aftermath of significant
              tsunamis worldwide, in order to gather coherent, quantitative sets of modern
              data which can then become the basis for modeling the source of the tsunami
              through state-of-the-art computational techniques.  For past tsunamis, the
              comparison between simulations for a variety of sources of the tsunami and the
              surveyed dataset has provided fundamental and occasionally unexpected insight
              into the dynamics of the ocean floor during, or immediately following, an
              earthquake in the marine environment.

The information from this survey, as
              with previous surveys, will be distributed worldwide via the tsunami Internet
              bulletin board.
