Abstract    :
               Much good Internet research is being frustrated by an inability to
  deploy
              experimental router software at points in the network where it
  makes most
              sense.  This problem affects a wide range of research,
  including routing
              protocols themselves, active queue management
  schemes, and so-called
              "middlebox" functionality such as intrusion
  detection systems.  Research
              becomes unrealistic because of the
  difficulty of experimenting under real
              network conditions; often ideas
  never make it out of the network
              simulator.

  To address these problems, the XORP project will develop a
              complete
  open-source router software platform, from forwarding path to
              routing
  protocols, using an architecture that permits extensibility whilst
              at
  the same time providing stable well-performing basic router
 
              functionality.  The vision is of an integrated router software
  platform
              running on off-the-shelf hardware, that is sufficiently well
  performing and
              reliable to see production service in a wide range of
  network conditions. 
              The software architecture will be designed with
  extensibility in mind from
              the start.  The goal is for Internet
  researchers needing access to router
              software to have a common
  platform for experimentation; this will provide
              all the basic router
  functionality that the researcher can then use to
              perform measurements
  or augment with new protocol functionality.
