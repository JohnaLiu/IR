Abstract    :
              This project tests and explores the hypothesis that soil erosion in upland
              ecosystems constitutes a measurable and significant sink of atmospheric carbon
              dioxide. The hypothesis is being tested in watersheds where soil erosion rates
              have been previously determined using cosmogenic isotope measurements. At each
              field site, the researchers will excavate numerous soil profiles, measure their
              total carbon storage, calculate rates of carbon loss from convex portions of
              the landscape, and calculate storage in concave areas (hollows),  using a
              diffusion modeling approach. Other ancillary soil organic matter properties
              (C:N ratio, N content, and N isotope composition) predicted to change
              systematically with erosion, will be measured to further test and confirm our
              hypothesis. The work will address one of the great uncertainties about the role
              of soils in the global carbon budget.
