Competition can play a key role in structuring plant
              communities, and understanding the mechanisms of plant competitive interactions
              is therefore critical for successful management of natural and cultivated
              systems. Yet despite years of study, the nature of plant competitive
              interaction and their relationship to environmental conditions is incompletely
              understood and continues to be debated. Belowground competition and its
              relation to fine-scale heterogeneity in soil resources is a particularly little
              explored area, despite the ubiquity of soil heterogeneity in nature. This
              research will use experimental and modeling approaches to investigate root
              foraging traits and their relationship to plant competitive ability and plant
              community diversity in spatially heterogeneous soil. Greenhouse and field
              experiments will be used to measure the scale, precision, and rate of root
              foraging and their relationship to the competitive ability of herbaceous
              perennial species, including an important invasive weed. An especially novel
              focus of this research is the phenomenon of belowground size asymmetry and its
              role in plant competitive ability and community structure. Field experiments
              and simulation modeling will examine whether fine-scale heterogeneity affects
              competitive size symmetry and competitive hierarchies, and the consequences for
              plant species coexistence and the maintenance of plant community diversity.
              This research has the potential to redirect our understanding of root
              competition and its role in the structure of plant communities.
