This one-year award in computer aided design and applications
              involves researchers from nine US universities in the US and seven laboratories
              of the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the French
              National Institute for Research in Informatics and Applied Mathematics (INRIA).
              Keqin Gu of Southern Illinois University and Silviu-Iulian Niculescu at the
              University of Science and Technology in Compiegne, France are the principal
              organizers of this joint effort.  US and French engineers, mathematicians and
              computer scientists will meet in a workshop format to collaborate on time-delay
              topics including: stability and performance issues, input-output approaches,
              prediction and feedback control design, and applications in energy distribution
              networks, computer networks, and load balancing in parallel computation.  The
              researchers will develop new software, including a comprehensive toolbox for
              computer aided control systems design applicable to time delay systems.

The
              collaboration takes advantage of complementary US and French expertise in
              systems and control areas.  Time-delay systems are present in nature, from
              biology models to population dynamics and from engineering to economics.   The
              collaboration will advance understanding of these systems and their
              applications to a wide variety of scientific disciplines and problems. 

This
              award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the French
              National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds
              and living expenses for the US investigators. The CNRS will support visits by
              French researchers to the United States.
