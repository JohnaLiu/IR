Frank
This award supports Curtis Frank and students from Stanford
              University in a collaboration with Brigitte Voit of the Institute for Polymer
              Research in Dresden, Germany.  The aim of the international project is to study
              a range of activites that are central to the overall goals of the NSF Materials
              Research Science and Engineering Center at Stanford/IBM/UC Davis and the
              international collabortion will receive support both from the German DAAD and
              from the Insititute for Polymer Research itself.  The specific goals of the
              collaboration include increasing the characterization and processing tools
              beyond those currently available for nanoparticle synthesis, providing a
              framework for exchange of researches, especially junior researchers, allowing
              undergraduate students the opportunity o patcipate in an international research
              project.  The work plan provides for extensive participation by graduate and
              undergraduate students in the international travel and research.
