Abstract    :
              There is a considerable void of data on the frequency, patterns, and mechanisms
              of seed and pollen dispersal within and among natural plant populations.  The
              goal of the research is to integrate empirical and theoretical approaches to
              the measurement dispersal over large distances.  The project uses molecular
              genetic markers, a large mapped tropical forest plot in Panama, and several
              long-term environmental data sets to address fundamental questions about the
              patterns, processes, and mechanisms of seed and pollen dispersal in five
              tropical tree species.

As humans continue to alter and fragment tropical
              forest landscapes, knowledge of those processes that regulate populations and
              maintain diverse communities is critical for predicting how these populations
              will respond in the future.  Chief among the population processes that will
              determine the ecological and genetic response over time and space is dispersal.
               To our knowledge, this study is among the first and most comprehensive
              attempts to obtain direct measurements of both seed and pollen dispersal
              distances using genetic techniques.  This study will directly inform
              conservationists and land managers as to the appropriate size of habitat
              required to maintain populations of tropical trees in light of the spatial
              extent of seed and pollen movement.
