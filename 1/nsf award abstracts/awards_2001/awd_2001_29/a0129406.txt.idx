Abstract    :
                This project will bring together knowledge and technology and refine them
              into an Assessment Design and Delivery System (ADDS) for science learning. 
              ADDS provides both a set of tools and a testbed to investigate factors the
              impact implementation, effectiveness, and scale-up.  Specifically, ADDS
              provides (1) utilities for individual teachers or teams of teachers to become
              designers and users of assessments that  actionable information to guide their
              practice and student learning; (2) embeds content, assessment and pedagogical
              knowledge to assist teachers in both designing assessments and interpreting
              student progress; and (3) valid results for classroom-based inferences with the
              potential for aggregation of results for policy uses.
