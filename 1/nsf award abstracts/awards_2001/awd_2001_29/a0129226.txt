This three-year award supports US-France collaboration
              in metal and ceramic powder manufacturing between Antonios Zavaliangos of
              Drexel University and Didier Bouvard of the National Polytechnic Institute,
              Grenoble, France.  Their collaboration addresses modeling and experimental
              aspects of anisotoropic shrinkage in sintering and compaction powder processes.
               During these processes, powder mixtures are pressed into different and
              sometimes complex forms.  Characterization of microstructure evolution during
              powder sintering and modeling of anisotropic aspects will be studied.  

The
              collaboration merges modeling and experimental approaches.  The US investigator
              brings to this collaboration, expertise in thermomechanical modeling.  This is
              complemented by participation in experiments in France and French expertise in
              physiochemical and microstructural characterization.  Sintering of powder
              mixtures is a key step in a number of processing techniques for a variety of
              industrial processes, such as manufacturing of steel parts and hard magnets. 
              This research will advance our understanding of behavior of powder mixtures and
              enhance predictive modeling capabilities.  The collaboration includes an
              educational component.  An instructional module is planned for classroom use
              and undergraduate students will participate in the experiments in France.

              
This award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the
              CNRS.  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator
              and students.  The CNRS will support visits by French researchers to the United
              States.
