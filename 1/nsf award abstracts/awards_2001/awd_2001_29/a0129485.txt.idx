Abstract    :
              The potential usage of magnetorheological fluids (MRFs) for temporary
              in-situ solidification of coarse-grained soils is being investigated.  Should
              magnetorheological materials be successfully introduced into the pore space of
              a soil and solidified by application of a magnetic field, they could
              significantly improve our ability to sample saturated or dry cohesionless
              soils with minimum disturbance.  The cost savings over pore fluid freezing
              could be very significant.  Other potential future applications of MRFs in
              geotechnical engineering may include: stabilization of soil for excavation
              and tunneling, control of seepage and contaminant migration, liquefaction
              hazard reduction, control of machine vibrations, soil surcharging to
              accelerate pre-construction settlement and others.  The present exploratory
              laboratory program will include tests for hydraulic conductivity, stiffness,
              strength, volume change susceptibility due to vibration, and stability of open
              cuts in MRF-stabilized soils.
