One of
              the most basic questions in ecology relates to the rules or mechanisms that
              determine the assembly of species into local communities.  Although some hold
              that physiological limitations of species along environmental gradients
              determine community composition, others argue that interspecific competition
              plays a pivotal role in determining the identity of coexisting species.  This
              research addresses such questions through a suite of manipulative experiments. 
              Twelve species of wetland plant, many used in restoration projects, will be
              combined in controlled experiments along a gradient of water depth.  By
              comparing aspects of growth in the presence or absence of competitors, this
              research will address two broad topics.  First, how much does competition
              suppress the ecological range of species, and to what extent is it variable and
              species-specific? Second, is competitive displacement one-sided, and if so what
              are the quantitative characteristics of this asymmetry?  Because this work will
              take place in a new outdoor classroom that is accessible by K-12 students, it
              will provide a concrete platform for illustrating the importance and role of
              research in understanding the ecology and conservation of wetlands.
