Abstract    :
              The "RNA-Based Life" Workshop will be held November 15-18, 2001 at Indiana
              University in Bloomington, IN.  The objective of the RNALife Workshop is to
              provide a high caliber, interdisciplinary meeting for researchers with an
              interest in the many roles RNA can play in sustaining life, focusing on the
              single question, "How viable is life based on RNA?"  The question is relevant
              to cutting edge efforts in metabolic engineering, molecular medicine, cell
              biology and studies of the origin of life.  This will be the first meeting of
              its kind.  It is intended to be international in scope and to provide extensive
              opportunities for interaction between established scientists from various
              fields of RNA research and the next generation of scientists.  The meeting is
              open to principal investigators, postdoctoral fellows, graduate and
              undergraduate students and other interested scientists.
