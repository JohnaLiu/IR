Workshop: Proposal for Conference
              on the History of Atmospheric CO2 and its Effect on the Evolution of Plants,
              Animals, and Ecosystems

Several new proxies to estimate the concentration of
              atmospheric CO2 have been developed in the last few years so that our
              understanding of the history of CO2 in the atmosphere is much improved. Plant
              growth is strongly influenced by the concentration of atmospheric CO2, causing
              changes in nutrient status and the production of plant toxins, and affecting
              the competition between plants using different photosynthetic pathways or
              having different physiological strategies. Changes in availability, nutrient
              content, or toxicity of certain plants impacts animals at the ecosystem level.
              Therefore, atmospheric CO2 can be considered to be a driver of evolution at the
              ecosystem level. The time is now ripe for a synthesis of recent work that links
              the history of atmospheric CO2 to evolution at the ecosystem level. This grant
              will support an international symposium to address this topic.
