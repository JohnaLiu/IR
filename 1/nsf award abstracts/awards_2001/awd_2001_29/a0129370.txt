              Lay Summary

	Animals recognize and respond to many different volatile
              chemicals in their environment using specialized nerve cells called olfactory
              neurons. We are interested in understanding how the specific functional
              properties of individual olfactory neurons are defined during development. We
              are exploring this issue in the model genetic organism, the small soil nematode
              C. elegans. C. elegans responds to and discriminates among thousands of
              environmental chemicals using a small set of olfactory neurons including the
              AWA, AWB and AWC neurons. We propose to investigate how the functions of the
              AWB neurons are defined developmentally. In previous work, we identified three
              genes that play important roles during AWB development. In animals mutant for
              the kin-29 protein kinase gene, the AWB neurons fail to correctly express a
              subset of olfactory receptor proteins. In sns-11 mutants, the AWB neurons do
              not exhibit any AWB-specific functional or morphological properties, while in
              sns-9 mutant animals, additional AWB-like neurons are observed. We will utilize
              genetic, molecular and biochemical techniques to further investigate the roles
              of these three genes in AWB neuron development. We expect that our findings
              will not only yield insights into the mechanisms by which functional diversity
              is achieved among olfactory neurons, but also provide information regarding the
              basic principles underlying neuronal development.
