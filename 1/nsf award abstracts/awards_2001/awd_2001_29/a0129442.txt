Abstract    :
              This planning grant is a collaboration between the Education Development
              Center's for Children and Technology (CCT) and Wireless Generation, a
              technology development company.  Together, the collaborators are building a
              suite of handheld diagnostic tools that make it possible for teachers to
              conduct observational assessments and collect the process data necessary to
              effect changes teaching and  students' learning.  The planning period will be
              used to conduct a thorough review of the literature, strengthen the research
              design, and focus on designing an assessment system. During the planning
              process, CCT will draw on an interdisciplinary team and a nationally recognized
              board of advisors to guide the work.
