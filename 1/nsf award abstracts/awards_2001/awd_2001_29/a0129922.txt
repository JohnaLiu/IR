Abstract    :
              Anthropologists have long been interested in the life histories of women as they
              are embedded in culture and in understanding the social and biological
              processes underlying lifespan transitions such as puberty, birth, and
              menopause.  The goal of this project is to better understand the natural
              history and daily experiences of the menopause transition in contemporary
              American women.  Between 1992 and 1998, 59 women, aged 45 to 50 at entry into
              the study, kept records of biological, psychological, and social events and
              experiences for one to five years.  Unlike most previous studies of the
              perimenopause, which were cross-sectional or relied upon infrequent contact and
              relatively few measurements, the present study used daily checklists of events
              (e.g., stressors, exercise, sexual experiences, physical symptoms) and mood
              ratings, along with standardized psychosocial questionnaires and personal
              narratives, to obtain a full description of the experience and meaning of the
              menopause transition.  This fine-grained information will allow the exploration
              of changes, processes, and interrelationships among factors that vary on a
              daily or weekly time scale, as well as the examination of processes that take
              place over time periods up to several years in length.  In previous studies,
              the authors have demonstrated that a rich view into the lives of individual
              women can be obtained through the use of daily recording of selected variables.
               This is the next best thing to becoming participant observers in the classic
              anthropological sense by immersion in the experiences of each of the women
              whose lives are being followed.  Information collected as part of this study
              includes over five million data points from the daily checklists in addition to
              extensive narrative descriptions of significant life events.  Funding will
              allow analysis of these data using appropriate quantitative and qualitative
              techniques.
