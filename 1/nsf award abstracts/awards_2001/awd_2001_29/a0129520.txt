Abstract    :
              This SGER (Small Grant for Exploratory Research) project involves airborne
              measurements of aerosol phase organic compounds during ACE-Asia (Aerosol
              Characterization Experiment-Asia). In this collaboration with Dr. Barry Huebert
              of the University of Hawaii, the PI is providing his aerosol sampling system
              for use in the NSF C-130 aircraft. In this particular configuration, the
              airflow will be passed through a particle concentrator, a diffusion denuder,
              and filters. This minimizes potential artifacts associated with the collection
              of semi-volatile organic compounds. Recent measurements have pointed to the
              potentially large and yet insufficiently well understood role of organic
              compounds in atmospheric aerosols and their climate forcing. The airborne
              measurement of organic carbon is a crucial component of the ACE-experiment
              which takes place in a region where the role of carbonaceous material is
              expected to be very significant.
