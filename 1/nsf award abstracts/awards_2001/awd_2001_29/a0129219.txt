 Abstract

Evolution in response to human activities is of great
              economic importance, for example in agriculture.  It would be extremely useful
              to be able to predict when and how such changes will evolve. We know that
              mutation and genetic variation is necessary for evolution.  This project will
              search for simple general features of mutation and genetic variation to use as
              the basis for predictions about evolution, and test these predictions against
              the differences observed among species.  The wings of fruit flies (Drosophila)
              will be used as a model system.  Surprisingly, integration of mutation,
              variation and evolution in one study has never been attempted with a
              multicellular organism.

	If the predictions of this project are borne out,
              the methods developed would be applicable to evolution in domesticated plants
              and animals.  If one can predict combinations of features that are unlikely to
              evolve, costly breeding programs that are doomed to fail could be avoided.
              Alternatively, features that are unlikely to evolve with natural variation
              would be attractive targets for genetic manipulations. If the predictions are
              not borne out, this will point to the need for a more detailed understanding of
              the functional basis of biological traits before predictions are useful.
