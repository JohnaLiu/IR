Abstract    :
              To continue to address the goal of characterizing the behavior of HPC
networks,
              the NLANR/MNA group plans to extend and expand the Network
Analysis
              Infrastructure (NAI) by deploying more sophisticated
              measurement
architectures, meeting the needs of new measurement domains,
              and
developing network analysis partnerships with established and
              developing
researchers.  Planned projects include the extension of the
              Active
Measurement Project (AMP) into the campus domain, the repackaging of
              AMP
for distribution, a wider range of measurements, and the development
              of
new data analysis tools, including visualizations and automated
              event
detection. The Passive Measurement and Analysis (PMA) project will
              be
extended to allow detailed study of packet flows through a router
and
              across an end-to-end path.  Other developments will include PMA
measurements
              focused on coordinated measurement, allowing the behavior of
parts of the
              network to be understood as they relate to one another, as
well as
              measurements of higher speed network paths.  With these
developments, the NAI
              will continue to be an excellent platform and source
of research data and
              methods from which other researchers (including
students) can build their own
              projects and with which systems engineers
and administrators can improve their
              networks.
