Abstract    :
              QUANTA is a toolkit for supporting TeraNode applications over
              optical
networks.

Getting terascale collaborative applications to work
              optimally on a high
speed optical network is not as simple as connecting ones
              computer to the
Internet. Today's protocol stacks and scientific applications
              cannot and do
not know how to utilize this extreme level of bandwidth even
              when it is
available. We intend to address this problem with Quanta, a
              cross-platform
adaptive networking toolkit for supporting the extraordinary
              networking
requirements of terascale collaborative applications. Quanta will
              consist of
a collection of novel networking protocols that are designed for
              handling a
wide variety of extremely high bandwidth application traffic flows;
              and a
Quality of Service (QoS) architecture to flexibly control these
              protocols
and support electronic and optical QoS mechanisms such as
              Generalized Multi
Protocol Label/Lambda Switching (GMPLS). The goal is to
              provide an easy to
use system that will allow programmers to specify the data
              transfer
characteristics of their application at a high level, and let
              Quanta
transparently translate these requirements into the appropriate
              transmission
protocol and network QoS services.
