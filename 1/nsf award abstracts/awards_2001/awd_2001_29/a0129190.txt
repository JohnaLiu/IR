The objective of this proposal is to develop
              electrohydrodynamic and chemical methods for fabricating nanoscale spheroidal
              particles and filaments from transition metals and oxides.  Sol-gel chemistry
              in conjunction with electrically driven liquid jets and droplets will be used
              to make uniform metal and hybrid organic-inorganic particles and fibrous
              deposits.  Metal alkoxides of Ti, V, Si, and Al will be used in the presence of
              solvent mixtures to effect fiber and particle formation at electrically driven
              jets.  The fabrication of nanoscale glassy fibers sheathed with an organic
              resin will be attempted.  The design of more complex structures using a novel
              concentric-tube feed is planned.  Basic characterization will be performed
              using electron microscopy, diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared
              spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed decomposition.  An international
              collaboration with scientists from Spain will be established.  The Spanish
              group has expertise in electrospray formation and will assist in the design and
              modeling of this process.  An industrial partner will provide student support
              and equipment.  The materials produced by these methods possess high
              surface-to-volume ratios and have potential for use as catalysis and sorbents.
