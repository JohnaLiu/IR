Proposal Title:	Endophyte Mediation of
              Tri-Trophic Interaction in Quercus gambelli

The importance of
              endophytic fungi (fungi that live within the leaves of plants) in mediating
              interactions between host plants, insect herbivores, and the natural enemies of
              herbivores (predators and parasitoids) is poorly understood in natural systems.
              The proposed research will examine both direct and indirect effects of
              endophytic fungi on plant herbivore interactions in a southwestern oak (Quercus
              gambelii) by using a combination of field sampling, chemical analyses, and
              controlled field experiments. In addition, the influence of environmental
              variation on the outcome of antagonistic interactions between endophytic fungi
              and interactions between endophytes and herbivores will be tested using field
              inoculations of fungal species onto oak hosts.  The proposed research will
              contribute to our understanding of plant-herbivore interactions, and will help
              identify factors that influence plant susceptibility to herbivore attack. By
              understanding how herbivores respond to plants bearing endophytic fungi,
              results of this research will provide important insights into developing new
              strains of pest-resistant crop plants. In addition, the results of this
              research will provide background data on the potential use of endophytic fungi
              as biocontrol agents against insect herbivores.
