Abstract    :
              EIA-0129731 Robert R. Birge Syracuse University  Title: Optimized
              Bacteriorhodopsin Proteins for Photonic and HolographicMemory Storage  The
              protein bacteriorhodopsin is being optimized for bioelectronic and photonic
              applications through site directed mutagenesis, random mutagenesis and directed
              evolution. The native protein has many characteristics that make it a nearly
              optimal photonic material, but further optimization is necessary to achieve
              competitive performance in computer applications. The goal is to generate
              protein variants that are optimized for holographic associative memories and
              large scale volumetric memories.  The former memory system is based on
              Fourier-transform holography, and the protein will be optimized for thermal
              stability, quantum efficiency and holographic efficiency.   The large scale
              volumetric memory is based on a branching reaction out of the main photocycle. 
              The protein is being optimized for this application by increasing thermal
              stability, branching efficiency and long-term stability of the branched
              photoproduct.   Genetic engineering is the best method for achieving all three
              goals simultaneously, and directed evolution is being studied as one possible
              method of rapidly achieving these goals simultaneously. This is a collaborative
              project involving researchers at the W. M. Keck Center for Molecular
              Electronics at Syracuse University and molecular biologists at the University
              of Connecticut.
