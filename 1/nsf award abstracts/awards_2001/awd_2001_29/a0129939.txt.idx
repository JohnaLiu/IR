Abstract    :
              EIA-0129939 Ronald Breaker Yale University  Title: Engineering Molecular
              Logic Gates Using Nucleic Acids  Under this project, test tube evolution is
              used to create molecular switches that serve as logic gates, and these
              chemically triggered switches are assembled into first-generation biomolecular
              computing devices. This project is creating new functional RNA and DNA
              molecules that perform as distinct types of logic gates. This advance in
              "molecular hardware" design is adding to the repertoire of molecular computing
              infrastructure and permitting the construction of more advanced molecular
              computing devices. As a demonstration of utility, these logic gates are
              assembled into molecular computing systems that can be used to add any two
              numbers.   A combination of modular rational design and in vitro evolution is
              being used to create nucleic acid molecular switches that are analogous to
              electronic logic gates. This design strategy employs the process of Darwinian
              evolution, where molecular "survival-of-the-fittest" is used to identify unique
              RNA switches that have AND gate function. The kinetic characteristics of the
              selected RNAs are examined to identify robust constructs that can be altered to
              produce up to 1 trillion different AND gate species. To demonstrate the utility
              of these logic gates, they are assembled to create a functional architecture
              for a molecular computer that can add any two numbers. The result of the
              molecular computation is reported as pixels on a chip-like surface using
              radioisotope signaling. In addition, other RNA and DNA switches are created
              using similar strategies that perform as representatives of the remaining
              common logic gates.
