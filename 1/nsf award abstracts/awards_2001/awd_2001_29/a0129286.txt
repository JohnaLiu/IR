This two-year award for a dissertation enhancement program
              in atmospheric chemistry is part of a US-France collaboration between the
              University of California, San Diego, and research group at the University
              Joseph Fourier in Grenoble, France.  Greg Michalski, a graduate student of Mark
              H. Thiemens, will carry out spectroscopic studies under the supervision of Remy
              Jost at the Physical Spectrometry Laboratory in Grenoble.  The objectives of
              the collaboration are investigations of mass independent fractionation (MIF)
              mechanisms using spectroscopic analysis of NO2 isotopomers.  The collaboration
              requires the synthesis of symmetric and asymmetric isotopomers of NO2.  Mr.
              Michalski will carry out the spectroscopy on the isotopomers substituting the
              central nitrogen atom with isotopes with integer and half-nuclear spins. 
              Probing states below the dissociation threshold will be done using Cavity
              Ringdown Spectroscopy.  Mr. Michalski will also be trained to operate the
              French laser systems and the expansion jet using standard NO2. 

The US team
              brings to this collaboration expertise in isotopomer synthesis. This is
              complemented by French expertise in spectroscopic measurements. The resulting
              data will provide a basis for a complete and quantitative theory to explain MIF
              in planetary atmospheres, the geologic record and in meteorites. The
              collaboration contributes as well to research and education infrastructure. 
              The graduate student will benefit through advanced training on specialized
              equipment in France and participation in an international team effort.
 
This
              award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the CNRS. 
              NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US graduate student.
              The CNRS will support visits by French researchers and students to the United
              States.
