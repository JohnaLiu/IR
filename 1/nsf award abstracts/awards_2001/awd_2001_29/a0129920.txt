	This research tests the consequences of centralized vs.
              de-centralized organizations on union locals  that represent health care
              workers in Chicago and in Pennsylvania.  Using consensus analysis based on
              triads tests the researchers will test the hypothesis that union consciousness
              will be more developed among union members in more de-centralized organizations
              than in the more centralized ones.  The results will advance our understanding
              of the relationship between the organization of power and the organization of
              cognitive structures, the relationship between organization structures and
              patterns of thought. The methodological contributions will be to further the
              development of consensus as a social science measurement technique, to relate
              it to ethnographic knowledge.  The practical contributions will be to assess
              the differences between centralized and participatory organizations in general,
              and to inform unions about the implications for their members of these
              structures.
