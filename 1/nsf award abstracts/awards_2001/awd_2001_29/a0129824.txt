Funds from this grant will support an upgrade to the
              single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) capabilities of the University of
              Illinois at Chicago.  A CCD detector equipped  XRD will replace an aging Picker
              instrument (vintage 1968) in Earth and Environmental Sciences (E&ES) and a
              Nonius diffractometer in Chemistry, and updates the capabilities of these
              laboratories.  The system will allow for research that is not now possible
              including study of much smaller crystals, a reduction in search time for single
              crystals suitable for study, and rapid data collection during high-temperature
              experiments, especially for phyllosilicate studies.  These studies often
              involve materials with high numbers of defects, where smaller crystallite sizes
              and a reduction in search time will increase productivity.  In addition, the
              use of smaller crystals will allow new materials to be studied in-house.  The
              E&ES X-ray laboratory has served as a major university and regional facility in
              the Chicago metropolitan area.  Routine use of the facility is made by the
              Departments of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Chemistry, Chemical
              Engineering, Dentistry, Civil Engineering, Physics, and the Research Resources
              Center, in addition to visitors from outside the University.  The system will
              provide single crystal capabilities that will substantially increase usage of
              the facility by a new group of researchers.
