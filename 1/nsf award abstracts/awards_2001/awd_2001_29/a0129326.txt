Abstract    :
              Non-native African fountaingrass has invaded the understory of Hawaii's dry
              forest; it is now causing death of native tree seedlings and productivity
              decline in mature trees.  Total conversion of this ecosystem to alien grassland
              would result in high biodiversity loss, disruption of natural biogeochemical
              cycles, and extinction of many culturally important plants, yet mechanisms
              underlying these alien-plant impacts are poorly understood.
We will determine
              how fountaingrass alters native-tree access to rainwater, and how this impact
              translates into productivity changes.  Particular emphasis will be placed on
              tree access to water from small rainstorms - which may provide water necessary
              for sustained activity between larger events. Future research will investigate
              resource competition for light and nutrients. 
Our long-term objective is a
              comprehensive understanding of mechanisms that cause conversion and alteration
              of ecosystem functions.  The Hawaiian dry forest is conducive to this goal and
              results may be applicable to other aridland ecosystems.
