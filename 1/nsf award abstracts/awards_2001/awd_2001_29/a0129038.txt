This proposal will continue the TREES Project, an 18-year
              study designed to examine the ecological bases of life history diversity and
              population ecology in tropical forest trees. The core activity is an annual
              census of 2300 individuals of ten canopy and emergent tree species in a 250 ha
              area of old-growth tropical wet forest. Growth, mortality, physical damage, and
              microsite conditions of all trees have been measured annually since 1983. All
              trees are mapped and incorporated into the La Selva Geographic Information
              System, and their distribution and performance have been studies in relation to
              both soil nutrients and topography over a meso-scale landscape. Two compelling
              scientific issues will be addressed during the next five years. One question
              with major environmental, political and economic implications is whether
              tropical rain forests are experiencing a decline in forest productivity with
              global warming. The second issue is the original core driver of the project, to
              elucidate the diverse life history modes represented among tropical rain forest
              canopy trees. The core TREES data set is the largest and longest record
              available of concurrent annually-measured growth and microsite conditions for
              tropical rain forest trees. This project clearly links population ecology with
              global climate change, and has important implications for conservation and
              maintenance of biodiversity in tropical ecosystems.
