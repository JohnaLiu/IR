Abstract    :
              
This project, building on a planning grant, provides a practical, theory-based
              approach to developing high quality assessments of science inquiry.  The
              project will produce: (1) a system for developing reusable assessment-task
              templates organized around schemas of inquiry; (2) generally stated rubrics for
              recognizing and evaluating evidence of inquiry skills; (3) an organized set of
              assessment development resources; (4) an initial collection of schemas,
              exemplar templates and tasks produced in the contest of the BioKIDS and FOSS
              projects; and (5) a statistical model that supports rigorous analyses of
              student learning.  Rigorous quantitative and qualitative methods will be used
              to document the process. A "quality of evidence" study will be conducted to
              determine if the information yielded by these assessments provides more useful
              and descriptive information of student learning than traditional assessments.
