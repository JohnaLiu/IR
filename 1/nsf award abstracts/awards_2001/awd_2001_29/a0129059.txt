Theodorakis
This award supports Chrostopher Theodorakis and students
              from Texas Tech University in a collaboration with Rupert Simon of the National
              Research Center for Environment and Health in Neuherberg, Germany.  The aim of
              the international project is to study the effect of thyroid-disrupting
              substance on molecular markers.  The ecological relevance of these responses
              will be assessed in laboratory exposure experiments with zebrafish and African
              clawed frogs as fish and amphibian model species.  The German group can provide
              samples of zebrafish exposed to selected pollutants, analyze them for thyroid
              hormones and iodinated compounds in tissue and serum samples, and determine
              exposure concentrations of organic contaminants in water and biological
              samples.  The group at Texas Tech will expose zebrafish and African clawed
              frogs to perchlorate and analyze thyroid histology, analyze differential gene
              expression, and perform analysis of perchlorate in water and tissues.  Results
              of the collaboration will develop new protocols for endocrine disrupting
              potential assessments of industrial and environmental chemicals. The work plan
              provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the international
              travel and research.
