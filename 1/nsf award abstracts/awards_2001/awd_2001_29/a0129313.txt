This three-year award for US-Portugal collaboration on the
              physics of quasimorphous silicon thin-film for applications in large-area
              electronics involves Abdul Middya and students at Syracuse University and
              Rodrigo F. Martins at the New University of Lisbon, Portugal.  The purpose of
              the project is to understand how drift mobilities and other electronic
              properties of thin-film silicon that are sensitive to disorder-induced
              localization vary.  The researchers will also explore why defect metastability
              varies between quasimorphous and conventional amorphous silicon.  
 
The US
              researchers bring to this collaboration expertise in electronic transport,
              density of-state measurements and device modeling.  This is complemented by
              Portuguese experience in plasma-processing of materials and fabrication of
              devices for photovoltaics and micro-electronics. Defect metastability is one of
              the greatest impediments for commercialization of non-crystalline Si-based
              thin-film technologies.  An understanding of defect metastability in amorphous
              silicon has technological significance for use in laptop computers, solar
              cells, and laboratory arrays and detectors.
