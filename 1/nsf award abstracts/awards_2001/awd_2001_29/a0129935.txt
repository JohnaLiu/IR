Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project by an anthropologist at the University of
              Chicago examines how a dispersed Nigerian community maintains its Yoruba
              cultural identity through ritual performances of religious music in African as
              well as U.S. churches. The research focuses on the changes in cultural
              practices and transnational identities of Nigerian migrants through the
              performance of music, dance, and oratory in churches in Lagos and Chicago. The
              objectives of this ethnographic research are to describe and analyze the formal
              characteristics and aesthetic values of Yoruba church music, and to compare the
              effects of migration on local identities and practices. The methods to be used
              include participant observation, collection of demographic data, life
              histories, and migration profiles through surveys and interviews, and detailed
              ethno-musicological analysis of religious ceremonies. Through careful
              ethnographic study of the local as well as transnational networks produced
              through musical performance, this project will advance our understanding of the
              relationship between cultural and economic processes of transnationalism and
              globalization. Methodologically, the research will contribute to
              anthropological studies of music and ritual by focusing on the ways in which
              music structures and is structured by other ritual modes. Finally, the study
              will explicate the meanings of the term "diaspora" as a social scientific
              concept as well as a lived experience. In addition to contributing to the
              education of a young social scientist, the research will advance our knowledge
              of this region of Africa, and improve our understanding of how migrants
              preserve and modify their culture in both originating and receiving societies
