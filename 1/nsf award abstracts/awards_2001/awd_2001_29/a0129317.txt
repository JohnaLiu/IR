Abstract    :
              A grant has been awarded to Drs. Regina Wetzer and Joel Martin of the Natural
              History Museum of Los Angeles County to study the relationships of a very
              diverse and important family of crustaceans.  These crustaceans are commonly
              known as pillbugs, sow bugs, or rolly-pollies, and scientifically known as
              sphaeromatid isopods.  Today more than 600 species are known, yet we still do
              not know how sphaeromatid species are related to one another and how they came
              into their present distribution on the planet.  This project will define their
              evolutionary relationships using analysis of both morphological features and
              gene sequences.  We will sample 100 species representing over 25 genera (1/6 of
              the world's sphaeromatid species diversity representing nearly 2/3 of the known
              generic diversity).  Our plan of sampling across taxa will provide a solid
              phylogenetic framework for the group.

We are living in one of the largest
              biodiversity crises in Earth history.  In similar previous crises, large
              proportions of the biota went extinct.  For humans to be able to survive the
              present crisis, we will need to understand which organisms are being affected
              and in what ways.  Unfortunately, for most animal groups, we are unable to
              identify the species and their evolutionary origins.  Therefore we cannot
              understand how their diversity and abundance is changing.  This study focuses
              on a group of animals that is common and globally distributed, and thus likely
              to be strongly affected by change.
