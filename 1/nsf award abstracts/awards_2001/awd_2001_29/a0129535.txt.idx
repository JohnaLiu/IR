Abstract    :
              0129535 Kolodzey  The PI proposes to evaluate the performance of a novel
              bio-chemical sensor based on the electrochemical field effect in MOS-type
              transistor structures. He has fabricated prototypes of this MOS sensor, and
              have found that they produced non-linear current-voltage responses to DNA
              molecules in an aqueous solution. Calculations indicate that the device should
              be highly sensitive to the electrochemical potential of bio molecules such as
              DNA and proteins. It should be capable of nanosecond response times
              for time-resolved measurements. These preliminary results will be described
              briefly here and in more detail in the Motivation Section of this
              proposal.  The operation of the sensor is based on the semiconductor surface
              field effect in MOS devices in which the electrochemical potentials (Fermi
              levels) of bio-compounds influence the electrical current flowing in a
              transistor-like device. The detected biomolecules are located within a Debye
              screening length of the gate insulator electrode. Calculations indicate that
              the proposed field effect device may be sensitive to less than 110
              molecules per square micron of active sensor area. By reducing the active area
              to 100 nm square, which is within lithographic capabilities, the sensor may be
              able to detect the charge on one DNA molecule.  The reason for the
              exploratory and high-risk status is that the PI has not yet performed a
              comparison of sensor responses with different types of DNA and other
              biomolecules.  He has not yet measured the time resolved response. The
              sensitivity is unknown, and it is uncertain if the sensor can distinguish
              different concentrations and different types of DNA. For this SGER proposal,
              the PI wants to measure the sensor response with different types of DNA to
              determine its sensitivity and selectivity. The measurements will be calibrated
              with an optical fluorescence microscope. If it turns out that this bio-chemical
              sensor is a valuable instrument that can yield useful information on
              biomolecules, he plans to submit a full proposal for a comprehensive research
              program.  A comprehensive proposal based on this sensor was submitted in
              November 2000 to the Nanoscience NIRT program, but was unsuccessful. The
              reviewers stated that a weakness was the lack of sufficient chemical and
              biological data on sensor operation. In this SGER proposal, the PI requests the
              funds to support a student and travel to obtain measurements of the sensor for
              different DNA molecules and reference solutions. These results would be used to
              justify further research and large funding programs.
