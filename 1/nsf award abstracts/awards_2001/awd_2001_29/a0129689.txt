Abstract    :
              NetFS is a file system interface to the network configuration parameters of an
              operating system.  All network configuration is performed by file operations,
              thus inheriting file system protection, including limited user and group
              access, as well as support for hierarchies, which more readily support virtual
              networks.  This results in fine-grained resource protection for individual
              network settings, providing in a safe environment in which applications can
              have controlled access to limited subsets of network configuration and 
              control, such as routing tables, interface configurations, IP security
              associations, and firewall rules.  NetFS also provides an interface that
              unifies access to these networking parameters of the operating system under a
              portable file system paradigm.  This unified controlled interface also more
              readily supports advanced virtual networking, where individual applications are
              attached to different subsets of network infrastructure to support concurrent
              participation in multiple coalitions.
