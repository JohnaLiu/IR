Abstract    :
              
Explaining the presence of the incredible diversity seen in nature has focused
              much attention on understanding why plants possess such a diverse collection of
              defensive traits, such as chemicals, hairs and thorns. This project combines
              field experiments that manipulate environmental factors (i.e., water, light,
              and herbivore load) with the statistical power of quantitative genetics to
              explore how selection acts on such traits both individually and as a suite of
              complex interacting traits.

Studies of the plant used in this research,
              Arabidopsis thaliana, have proceeded with great speed at the genome level, yet
              an understanding of this organism in nature lags behind. This study will not
              only allow a fuller understanding of the biology of this model organism, but it
              will also provide insight into the interaction of environment and genes.
              Understanding such interactions will allow us to better appreciate the
              consequences of environmental change on agricultural ecosystems, and could be
              used, for example, to develop crops that are designed to protect themselves.
              Because there is also a growing appreciation of the role of plant chemicals in
              human health, a fuller understanding of how selection acts on these chemicals
              might have important applications to nutrition and medicine.
