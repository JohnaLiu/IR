Abstract    :
              The research is for a continuation of a computational study of the effects of
              complex magnetic fields on bulk crystal growth processes.  In the project the
              investigators are focusing on several stability problems that are important for
              the growth of compound and solid-solution semiconductor crystals. There are
              really two distinct, but highly synergistic, application areas are involved: 
              (1) Study the effects of rotating magnetic fields on vertical Bridgman or
              vertical gradient freeze growth of solid-solution crystals such as alloys of
              germanium and silicon.  The investigators will develop the first stability
              analysis for a RMF including the effects of the buoyant convection and the free
              surface that are present in the actual process. (2) Study thermoelectromagnetic
              convection (TEMC) for the magnetically stabilized growth of compound
              semiconductor crystals. The investigators will develop a linear stability
              analysis to predict the transition from steady to periodic melt motions with
              buoyant convection, forced convection and TEMC. Both problems to be studied
              have the potential to contribute to improved quality and sizes for advanced
              semiconductor crystals that are important for optical and wireless
              technologies.
