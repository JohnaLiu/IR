This award supports Michael Perdue and students from Georgia
              Tech in a collaboration with Antonius Kettrup of the Department of Chemistry at
              the Technical University of Munich, Germany.  The aim of the international
              project is to describe the distribution of molecular weight and the
              pH-dependent distribution of charge in natural organic matter, which is a
              highly complex acidic mixture that occurs everywhere in natural waters.  This
              project will focus on a sample of natural organic matter from the Suwannee
              River, Georgia, USA, which is available from the International Humic Substance
              Society, and will integrate experimental results from capillary electrophoresis
              and potentiometric titration to elucidate the actual distribution of charge in
              the matter. The proposed research has a high potential to advance our ability
              to deal with important contemporary problems such as environmental toxicology
              of metals and organic chemicals an dthe influences of watershed properties on
              aquatic systems.  The work plan provides for extensive participation by
              graduate students in the international travel and research.
