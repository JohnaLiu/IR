Different animals and
              plants are found in different places.  Kangaroos and eucalyptus trees are
              characteristic of Australia, whereas giant pandas live only in China.  One must
              travel far to see a close human relative, the lemurs, found only on the island
              of Madagascar.  Surprisingly, no single source of information summarizes the
              geographic ranges of all mammal species.  It is now all the more important to
              have such a database because species ranges are rapidly changing due to global
              climate change, habitat fragmentation, and human population growth.  If there
              is a single prescription for species conservation, it is the preservation of
              natural geographic range distributions of a species.

The primary sources for
              discovering where species live are maps showing point localities and range
              boundaries of a species.  Our research will use GIS technology to digitize
              current range maps for all mammal species.  We will use this database to
              examine three broad questions: (1) How do species differences in geographic
              range relate to their ecology or reproduction? (2) How are geographic ranges in
              mammals influenced by humans (i.e.,  dense human populations and land usage)? 
              (3) How will geographic areas with high mammalian diversity (e.g., tropical
              forests) be effected by climate and other global changes?  These questions are
              fundamental to understanding why almost a quarter of the 4,763 mammal species
              currently are  threatened with extinction and using that information to
              establish conservation priorities.  Both graduate and undergraduate studetns
              will be involved in all facets of this researh, and the entire database will be
              available freely on the worldwide web.
