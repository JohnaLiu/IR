Abstract    :
              The research questions for this proposal are designed to explore the
              interactions of teaching practices, curriculum materials, and professional
              development to understand how they can be optimized to improve student
              learning.  The University of Delaware and Texas A&M University, working in
              partnership with Project 2061 of the American Association for the Advancement
              of Science, will study how to provide, on a large scale, the professional
              development and continuing support teachers need to improve student learning of
              key ideas and skills in middle-grades mathematics.  Over five years of a
              longitudinal study, the research team will examine how the use of specific
              research-based instructional strategies in the classroom-supported by
              professional development and highly-rated curriculum materials-relate to
              lasting improvements in student learning.  An experimental study in years 4 and
              5 will test the feasibility of delivering professional development and ongoing
              support cost-effectively on a large scale.
