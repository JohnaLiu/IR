Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this international conference entitled "Primate
              Origins" is to assemble a series of experts who are currently performing novel
              research concerning the unique adaptive characteristics of the Order Primates
              (the taxonomic group to which humans, apes, monkeys, and prosimians belong).
              Primates are distinguished from other mammals by several traits of the skull
              and limbs, most notably the opposable big toe, nails instead of claws on the
              digits, larger brains, reduction of the organs responsible for the sense of
              smell, and larger more convergent eyes which are protected by additional bone
              around the sockets. This conference will provide a long-overdue comprehensive
              reassessment of the adaptations of the first primates utilizing the expertise
              of both paleontologists and those who study living primates. We will provide
              the first comprehensive analysis of the adaptive significance of pronounced
              morphological and behavioral transformations during this important and
              interesting stage of primate evolution which will also facilitate a fuller
              understanding of groundwork for the transformations that took place during the
              later evolution of higher primate.
