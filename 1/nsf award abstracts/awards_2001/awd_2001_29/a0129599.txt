Abstract    :
              Mn-superoxide dismutase and Fe-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD and FeSOD) catalize
              alternating one-electron oxidation and reduction of the superoxide anion (O2
              -), to molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (O2 and H2O2). These enzymes
              extend our healthy life, and are closely related to enzymes that mediate
              degradation of toxic wastes, and synthesis of antibiotics. This research seeks
              to understand the determinants of SOD's catalytic activity. Previous work has
              shown that the SOD proteins can tune the reduction midpoint potential, Em , of
              the bound Fe2+/3+ or Mn2+/3+ ion over more than half a volt, thus providing
              potential access to a wide range of chemistry. The protein has been proposed to
              achieve this via hydrogen bonding between a conserved active site glutamine and
              a coordinated solvent molecule. The spectroscopic, structural and thermodynamic
              studies, on native enzymes and a few mutants, will elucidate the mechanism and
              magnitude of this hydrogen bonding's effect on the Em. In addition, the first
              characterizations of Mn-substituted FeSOD, whose Em is higher than 900 mV, will
              be carried out. This research will test a rational, chemical mechanism for
              redox tuning in metalloproteins. Many metalloenzymes besides SOD include a
              solvent molecule among the metal ion ligands, and as a rule this solvent also
              hydrogen bonds with protein residues. Thus, understanding gained as to the
              magnitude of redox tuning this can afford, and the extent to which it can be
              manipulated, will have general applicability.
