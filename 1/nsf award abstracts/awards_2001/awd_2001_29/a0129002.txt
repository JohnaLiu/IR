This Americas Program will support a planning meeting in
              La Paz, Mexico, jointly organized by Dr. Laura I.  Gonzalez-Guzman, of SUNY and
              Dr. Sergio Hernandez-Vazquez of the Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas del
              Noreste, in La Paz, Mexico. The organizers plan to develop a collaborative and
              interdisciplinary research project aimed at building a conceptual framework for
              linking the socioeconomic dynamics of community-based fisheries with the
              dynamics of natural ecosystems, and determining how these joint forces
              influence the marine environment and the sustainability of fisheries in the
              Northern Pacific West Coast of Mexico.

The meeting will involve scientists
              with backgrounds in ecology, fisheries science, economics, resource management,
              and geography from the US and Mexico.  The research program that will be the
              outcome of this planning meeting will have three main components: an ecosystem
              component, a socioeconomic component, and an education and outreach component. 
              Ultimately, the project will serve to develop now approaches to fisheries
              management in Baja California and models and guidelines for management and
              conservation to be applied to the coastal fisheries of the Pacific
              region.
