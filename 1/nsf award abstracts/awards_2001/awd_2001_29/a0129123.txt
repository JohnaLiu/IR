Increasing
              concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) 
and ozone (O3) are
              anticipated to exert widespread impacts on 
ecosystems. Exceedingly little is
              known, however, about the 
effects of these factors on the dynamics and
              genetic structure of 
populations of interacting species. The purpose of this
              research is 
to assess the independent and interacting effects of elevated CO2
              
and O3 on the dynamics of a host plant - herbivore - natural enemy 
model
              system. This research will be conducted at the Aspen FACE 
(Free Air CO2
              Enrichment) facility in northern Wisconsin. Studies 
will be conducted to
              evaluate the long-term impacts of CO2 and O3 
on the population dynamics of
              natural assemblages of red clover, 
pea aphids, and two natural enemies
              (ladybeetles and a parasitic 
wasp), and the importance of genotype in
              influencing such 
interactions. Results will improve our understanding of the
              relative 
importance of competition as well as bottom-up and top-down
              
trophic interactions for community dynamics, in the context of 
global
              environmental change.
