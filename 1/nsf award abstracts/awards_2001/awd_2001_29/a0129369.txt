This is a 24 month AWARE center-center linkage proposal
              submitted by Dr. Ying-Hwa (Bill) Kuo, UCAR, for establishing start-up phase of
              a broad-based program to create new and strengthen existing research,
              operational and education linkages between the U.S. atmospheric science
              community and that of the nations of East Asia.  The scientists involved, both
              in the U.S. and East Asia, are among the world's best, with excellent records
              of prior research.  The science to be incorporated is cutting edge, innovative,
              groundbreaking, and facilities and opportunities available for U.S. scientists
              at research sites in Taiwan related to COSMIC project and the Earth Simulator
              in Japan are unique in the world. 

The two-year start-up phase of this
              program will allow UCAR to develop a relationship with its international
              counterparts, to formulate detailed plans for its educational programs, and to
              establish its cooperative research and training projects.   At the end of the
              start-up phase, UCAR will submit a follow-up proposal to continue the
              collaborative education, research and training program. This broad-based
              program can create new and strengthen existing research, operational and
              education linkages between the U.S. atmospheric science community and that of
              the nations of East Asia, and will greatly benefit to U.S. students and junior
              scientists in atmospheric science.
