This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in earth
              sciences involves researchers and graduate students at the University of
              Maryland and Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon and the French Atomic Energy
              Commission in Saclay.  Daniel P. Lathrop and Jean-Francois Pinton will lead in
              the US and France respectively in experiments in magnetic field generation in
              liquid metals flow.  This research is relevant to understanding nonlinear
              dynamics associated with turbulent flow conducting fluids.  Such conditions are
              thought to occur in the Earth, planetary bodies, and stars.  The experiments
              take advantage of access to a new experimental sodium facility constructed and
              funded by the French Ministry of Research.  This facility has a larger capacity
              than similar experimental facilities at the University of Maryland.  The US and
              French groups have complementary skills in fluid turbulence, nonlinear
              dynamics, and in fluid experiments. Reciprocal visits of students are
              emphasized to advance their research training and encourage future
              international partnerships.

This award represents the US side of joint
              proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research
              (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US
              investigator and graduate students.  CNRS will support the visits of the French
              researchers and graduate students to the United States. The collaboration will
              advance fundamental understanding of the Earth's magnetic field and the
              magnetic fields of other planetary and astrophysical bodies.
