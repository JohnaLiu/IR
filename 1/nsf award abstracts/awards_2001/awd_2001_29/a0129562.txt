Abstract    :
              The structure and stability of combustion processes in real mixtures is analyzed
              using mathematical methods for partial differential equations.  Diffusion
              flames, premixed flames, and detonations are addressed. Through
              nondimensionalization of the conservation equations, appropriate parameters are
              identified, typically activation energies or ratios of reaction rates. 
              Asymptotic analysis identifies limiting values and simplifies the conservation
              equations, enabling solution analytically without resort to numerical
              integration.  Formulas are derived for quantities of interest such as burning
              velocities, ignition or extinction strain rates, autoignition delay times, and
              critical conditions for stability.  Systems addressed include combustion of
              higher hydrocarbons and higher alcohols including production of nitrogen
              oxides, intrinsic detonation stability, and influences of strain on flames. 
              Reduced kinetic schemes are derived and their influences on flame and
              detonation behaviors are analyzed.
