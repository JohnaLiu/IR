Abstract    :
              
The objective of this research program is to develop a comprehensive framework
              for nonlinear model-based feedback control of multivariable hybrid nonlinear
              processes (i.e., processes with combined continuous dynamics and discrete
              events).  Both lumped and spatially-distributed hybrid systems will be studies.
               Lyapunov theory will be employed to produce novel analytical nonlinear
              controller designs that deal explicitly with control actuator constraints and
              model uncertainty and enforce the desired stability, performance and robustness
              specifications in the closed-loop system.  The motivation for the research is
              provided by: a) the common coupling of continuous process dynamics with
              discrete events, b) the abundance of nonlinearities and uncertainties in
              chemical process models coupled with the common occurrence of hard constraints
              on the capacity of control actuators, c) the lack of practical nonlinear
              control methods for hybrid chemical processes that can deal explicitly and
              simultaneously with nonlinearities, uncertainty and constraints and d) the
              increasing need to improve chemical process operation to reduce product
              variability and off-spec production, improve energy efficiency and reduce
              environmental impact.  To realize the desired objective, the research will
              focus on the following projects: a) nonlinear and robust control of
              multivariable hybrid nonlinear processes with input constraints, b) output
              feedback implementation of the nonlinear and robust controllers using nonlinear
              state estimators, c) nonlinear and robust control of spatially-distributed
              hybrid processes, d) application of the nonlinear control algorithms to
              simulated lumped and spatially-distributed hybrid processes with uncertainty
              and actuator saturation, and e) development and experimental application of a
              real-time integrated measurement/hybrid feedback control system to a
              plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) reactor.  The research will
              provide fundamental insights into the limitations imposed by the presence of
              nonlinearities, uncertainty, constraints and discrete events on our ability to
              modify the dynamics of a chemical process, provide concrete control algorithms
              that can be readily implemented in practice, illustrate the application of the
              control methods and derive tuning guidelines for the implementation of the
              controllers, and produce a research monograph on "nonlinear process control"
              based on previous and current research of the PI in this area.  The new control
              algorithms are expected to lead to significant improvement in the operation and
              performance of chemical process systems with combined continuous/discrete
              dynamics, nonlinearities, uncertainty and constraints.  The development of
              integrated measurement/control systems for PECVD processes is expected to
              reduce spatial non-uniformity of the deposition, especially as wafer dimensions
              continue to increase and broaden the use of these processes in semiconductor
              manufacturing.
