Abstract    :
              0129144 Brian Enquist  This award will support field research to obtain data
              for assessing assumptions and predictions of a new theoretical model for
              scaling plant anatomical and physiological attributes from within individuals
              to populations, and even ecosystems. The ultimate goal of this research is to
              expand and elaborate a general theoretical and mechanistic framework for
              scaling in biology. This framework is based on evolutionary and physical first
              principles, integrating how specific attributes of organismal form and function
              change with organismal size (allometry) and how such changes influence
              ecological and evolutionary phenomena. Field and laboratory assessments are
              necessary to (i) advance future efforts to scale anatomical and physiological
              attributes of individuals and (ii) to link how attributes of organisms at the
              level of the individual ramifies (scales) across plant populations,
              communities, and ecosystems.   This project focuses on understanding plant
              vascular form and function.  It will provide the base-line allometric data for
              woody plant species necessary to assess numerous predictions of theoretical
              models. Specifically, the research will focus on intensive anatomical and
              physiological measurements of four tree species which span a range of
              environmental gradients and are functionally diverse (including the three major
              classes of vascular structure; ring-, diffuse-, and non-porous vascular
              plants). Standardized measurements of anatomical and hydrodynamic attributes of
              individuals will be used to evaluate the model. For example, specific
              measurements will be made to determine how total leaf area, the number of
              branches, length of branches, total water flux/photosynthetic rate, stem
              conductivity, leaf specific conductivity, tracheid/vessel radius, the
              proportion of conductive and non conductive tissue, and water content scale
              with changes in plant mass and with branch diameter. Such information will be
              critical for (1) future elaboration of new theoretical models; (2)
              understanding scaling of physiological attributes of plants; and (3)
              investigating the evolutionary and ecological implications of allometry in
              biology. These three research directions will form the core of Dr. Enquist's
              research program as a new faculty member at the University of Arizona, and this
              award will support the building of a graduate program in biological scaling.
