Abstract    :
              
In the terms of this cooperative agreement, the National Opinion Research
              Center (NORC) will establish a Technical Center that will enhance the IERI
              program at the level of individual projects and at the meta level of theory
              building around the scaling up of effective educational interventions.  The
              Center will be organized around three functions: (1) technical assistance,
              training, and ongoing needs analysis in service of IERI grantees, (2) community
              building, and (3) research and theory building related to core IERI priorities.
               All Center activities will contribute to a larger purpose that is consistent
              with the mission of IERI: To bring demonstrably effective interventions to
              scale in order to enhance student learning, and to more fully understand the
              nature of the scaling-up process.  The activities of the Technical Center will
              be carried out in close and ongoing consultation with the cognizant NSF program
              officer and with the larger IERI Working Group.  All strategic decisions of the
              Center will be joint decisions between the Technical Center, NSF, and the
              larger program leadership of IERI.
