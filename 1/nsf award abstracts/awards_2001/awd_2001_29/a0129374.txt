Abstract    :
              The International Water Vapor (H2O) Project (IHOP) is a large multi-agency,
              multi-investigator project that focuses on the measurement of water vapor and
              water vapor variability.  The goal of the project is to improve understanding
              of convective initiation and to increase short-term precipitation forecast
              skills.  

The researcher will employ the Wyoming Cloud Radar system (WCR),
              in situ data from the University of Wyoming King Air research aircraft (UWYKA),
              and ancillary IHOP data to describe in unprecedented detail, the vertical
              structure and evolution of radar "fine-lines", such as outflow boundaries and
              drylines, and to interpret their ability to trigger deep convection.  The UWYKA
              is equipped with an array of atmospheric sensors to measure temperature,
              humidity, winds, and their fluxes, as well as cloud and radiation probes.  The
              combination of UWYKA and WCR data along stepped traverses will allow (a) a
              description of the kinematic and thermodynamic vertical structure of shallow
              convergence zones; and (b) an estimation of the variation of the boundary layer
              precipitable water, convection parameters, and moisture convergence across
              fine-lines.

The key hypotheses to be tested are:

1. The WCR data are
              sufficiently sensitive and detailed to describe various details of boundary
              layer structures

2. The WCR data allow a detailed and accurate description
              of the airflow in vertical sections across radar-detected fine-lines

3.
              Analysis of combined WCR, UWYKA, and ancillary IHOP data, in particular DIAL
              water vapor profiles will show that the variability of precipitable water in a
              'well-mixed' convective boundary layer is significant.
