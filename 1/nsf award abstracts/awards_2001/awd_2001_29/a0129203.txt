This award provides support to 8 US participants, including
              graduate students and junior faculty, in a US-France joint workshop on genome
              analysis of the plant pathogen, Erwinia Chrysanthemi 3937 in Lyon, France, July
              2002.  The workshop, organized by Nicole T. Perna of the University of
              Wisconsin and Nicole Cotte-Pattat of the Institut National des Sciences
              Appliquees de Lyon, France, brings together researchers in genomics and Erwinia
              biology.  The goals are: to discuss strategies for completing the sequencing of
              E. chrystanthemi genome and methods of genome analysis; to develop standards
              for annotation (predict genes and their functions); to train on a web-based
              multi-user annotation system; and to forge collaborations for post-sequencing
              projects. This workshop affords an opportunity for the ultimate end-users of
              the Erwinia genome sequence data to create the annotation and a solid framework
              for future research partnerships.

This award represents the US side of joint
              proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research
              (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel to France and living expenses of US researchers
              and graduate students.  The CNRS will support the travel of the French
              researchers to the workshop.
