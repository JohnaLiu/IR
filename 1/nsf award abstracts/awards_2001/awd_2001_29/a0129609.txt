Abstract    :
              The researcher  developed an international optically switched data mining
              testbed called the Tera Mining Testbed, linking the US, Canada and Amsterdam
              initially, and which supports the remote analysis and distributed mining of
              Gigabyte and Terabyte size data sets. 

The researcher  developed specialized
              protocols for moving data efficiently over high performance networks without
              the necessity of network tuning by striping data across networks and using
              related methods.  The researcher also developed high performance data servers
              for OC-XY networks and optical switched networks
incorporating parallel
              network transport and parallel input/output.
