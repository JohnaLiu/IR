Workshop on Linking Ecological Biology and Geoscience

Basic environmental
              science increasingly depends on collaborations among biologists
and
              geoscientists. We propose to bring together 35 leading scientists to explore
              how to
promote interdisciplinary research across the interface of ecological
              biology and
geological science. During a two-day meeting at the annual
              Ecological Society of
America (ESA) meetings, we will address questions about
              intellectual opportunities,
needs for unified synthetic models, and how best
              to support and fund such research
interactions. A central goal is to engage
              the broader community of scientists within the
ESA, in a manner similar to
              what is taking place in the American Geophysical Union
(AGU). The final
              product of this workshop will be a "white paper" report that addresses
the
              prospects and challenges for disciplinary convergence between ecosystem
              biology
and the geosciences. We will also submit summaries of the meeting to
              the ESA bulletin,
EOS, the Geological Society of America (GSA), and
              appropriate journals such as Nature
and Science.
