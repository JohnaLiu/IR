Abstract    :
              This Research Coordination Network, in the form of an International Institute
              "without walls," is dedicated to the advancement of research and education in
              Neuromorphic engineering.  Neuromorphic engineering is a young discipline in
              Bioengineering that is based on the design and fabrication on artificial neural
              systems, whose physical architecture and design principles are based on those
              of the biological nervous systems.  The Aims of the Institute for Neuromorphic
              Engineering (INE) will be: 1) to foster the continuation and completion of
              specific collaborative interactions designated at the annual Workshop; 2) to
              organize smaller and highly focused meetings throughout the year to allow the
              exchange of ideas and discussion on designated topics, as well as to hold a
              mid-winter meeting to discuss and evaluate the progress of the INE; 3) to
              organize and expand the education activities beyond the confines of the
              Workshop to other participating institutions.  The RCN members also will help
              organize the annual Telluride Workshop at which members and students will meet
              over three weeks for intensive research and teaching.  The INE will have
              minimal permanent administrative staff and will have no permanent scientific
              staff, building, or equipment overheads.  Instead, the INE will utilize the
              staff and facilities of its international member laboratories, which have a
              proven record of collaborative research.
