Abstract    :
              The National Academy of Sciences is provided with support for the Board on Earth
              Sciences and Resources and its Activities. The work will be conducted by the
              Division on Earth and Life Studies, Board on Earth Sciences and Resources.  The
              Board on Earth Sciences and Resources provides the focal point for National
              Research Council activities related to the Earth sciences. Through its
              committees, panels, and working groups, it provides independent advice on a
              wide range of Earth science issues, including those involving basic and applied
              research, the environment, natural hazards, resources, data (from acquisition
              and archiving to dissemination and management) and education. It also provides
              guidance on U.S. participation in international Earth science programs.
