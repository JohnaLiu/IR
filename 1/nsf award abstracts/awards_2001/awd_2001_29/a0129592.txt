Abstract    :
              This proposal advocates the research and development of tools and techniques
to
              detect, diagnose, and correct network faults in local broadcast
              domains,
whether they are wired (Ethernet) or wireless (802.11b).  These tools
              will
provide the troubleshooter with a useful visual reference for these
              network
domains and automate element-by-element investigation of performance
              along a
network path.  In addition, the wireless work will provide a
              standard
authentication platform for both IPv4 and IPv6 wireless clients.
