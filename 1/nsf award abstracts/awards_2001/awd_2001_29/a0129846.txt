Abstract    :
               This dissertation research is a comparative study of how those Maya communities
              associated with the archaeological zones, Chunchucmil and Chichen Itza,
              negotiate and experience their roles, meanings, and claims over archaeological
              patrimony in the context of the implementation of cultural heritage policy by
              national institutions, foreign archaeological projects, and international
              government organizations.  Through ethnographic description of Maya conceptions
              of space, property, and ownership, the juridical establishment and regulation
              of archaeological zones, and the recent efforts to establish local cultural
              foundations with international ties, the research considers how current
              endeavors on the part of archaeologists and local communities to develop and
              preserve cultural heritage promote "alternative privatizations" of
              archaeological zones. This study engages the fields of Maya studies and
              cultural heritage studies, providing baseline criteria by which to
              comparatively study how Maya communities integrate with the modernizing
              influences of institutional, scientific, and commercial agencies of regional,
              national, and international scale.  In addition to training a doctoral student
              in cultural anthropology, the findings of this research will contribute to
              understanding those factors that enhance or impede efforts to nationalize
              and/or privatize cultural heritage.
