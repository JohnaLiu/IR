Abstract    :
              The NLANR Distributed Applications Support Team is focused on
              supporting
researchers and research communities in the use of resources
              embedded within
high-performance networks and the middleware-based Grid
              environments that
depend on those networks. This proposal sets forth a plan
              for the next stage
for this leading edge team, building on previous efforts
              and assisting in
the maturing of user communities in the use of distributed
              resources
connected by advanced networks. This includes the development and
              extension
of end-user and network engineer oriented tools for both
              high-bandwidth
optical networks and low-bandwidth wireless networks, which
              will be the
critical network components for advanced applications in the next
              several
decades. Support functions will evolve from a focus on
              specific
projects to being a community support organization fostering
              the
development, support, and growth of a global community of network
              engineers
and network support staff working to advance networking in support
              of global
science. Outreach efforts will be expanded in raising awareness
in
              new and emerging communities, such as those associated with major NSF
              MRE
funding, of the dependencies these projects have with respect to
              networking
technologies.
