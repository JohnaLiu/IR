Much scientific effort has been expended in
              measuring CO2 exchanges between vegetation and the atmosphere in an attempt to
              determine the role of terrestrial ecosystems in the global carbon budget.  Most
              prior efforts have focused on mature forests.  However, these may not be
              representative of the overall landscape mosaic, since most forested landscapes
              are disturbed by humans, dominated by stands of varying ages, and subject to
              multiple edge influences.  This project uses a spatial modeling approach,
              supplemented and evaluated with direct field measurements of ecosystem carbon
              exchange, to understand landscape-level carbon flux, taking into consideration
              age structure and edge influences.  Such a broad-scale endeavor must rely
              heavily on models and remote sensing techniques because of the practical
              impossibility of obtaining enough direct flux measurements.  This project is
              among the first to provide strong quantitative information concerning carbon
              exchange at the landscape level, yet based on ecosystem-level process
              measurements.
