Abstract    :
              This workshop uses recognized experts in information technologies to improve our
              understanding of the appropriate use of information technology in sustainable
              development. We intend to look particularly closely at  remote environments
              recently affected by conflict and natural disasters.  Attention will be
              directed toward methods of collecting and relaying information between a remote
              local population and their environment, and we intend to evaluate both the
              methods and metrics of collection and the capability for remote,
              high-dimensional visualization of those complex local systems. The hypothesis
              is that collecting health information locally with the capability of remote
              visualization can offer a quantitative and predictive method for community
              analysis. With careful attention to design, and iterative feedback for the
              community, we expect to offer earlier recognition of a spectrum of possible
              threats. Information collected, analyzed, and iterated may improve health while
              guiding local development sustainability, thereby improving regional stability.
               Better understanding the ecology and epidemiology of locations distant in
              geography and in culture broadens our global insight and benefits national
              security.
