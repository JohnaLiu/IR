This award provides partial support (55%) for the
              acquisition of a CO2-laser fluorination system and an isotope-ratio mass
              spectrometer (IRMS) system for multiple stable isotope analyses (e.g., O, S &
              N) for geological and environmental samples.  These facilities will be
              installed and operated in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at the
              Louisiana State University (LSU). This acquisition will greatly improve LSU's
              existing research infrastructure and enhance current and planned research
              capabilities of the LSU geochemistry group.  In addition, the facilities
              provide excellent science education and training platform for undergraduate
              students.  The Principal Investigator (PI), Dr. Huiming Bao, recently joined
              the Department as an Assistant Professor.  The instruments will be the primary
              tool for Bao's research programs in multiple isotope geochemistries of oxygen
              (all three isotopes: 16O, 17O, & 18O), sulfur (all 4 isotopes: 32S, 33S, 34S, &
              36S), and nitrogen (14N & 15N). The capabilities of these new instruments will
              be used in research and educational activities aimed at a better understanding
              of elemental cycles in the atmosphere and in surface environments.  Immediate
              research plans include studies of long-term atmospheric deposition of sulfate
              and nitrate and their post-depositional mobility in Antarctic Dry Valley soil
              systems (in collaborating with Dr. Marchant at Boston University), oxygen and
              sulfur isotopic compositions of Archean sulfide and sulfate deposits in South
              Africa, and sulfate leached from recent and ancient volcanic ashes, all of
              which will benefit from the availability of a CO2-laser fluorination system and
              an IRMS that can offer efficient off-line/on-line gas extractions and
              high-precision multiple isotopic analyses with minimal sample size.
