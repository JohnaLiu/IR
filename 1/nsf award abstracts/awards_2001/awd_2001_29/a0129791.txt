Abstract    :
              This award renews support of the International Collection of
              Vesicular-Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (INVAM) at West Virginia University
              Research Collection. The collected fungi are soil-borne organisms that form
              mutualistic symbiotic associations with the roots of at least 80% of all
              terrestrial plant species. INVAM is the largest public collection of such
              fungi, with 1061 accessions at present. This award provides support to INVAM's
              continued operation of the collection. This includes characterization and
              preservation of collected germplasm , distribution of germplasm sources to user
              groups worldwide, centralization of information in an extensive Internet
              website, and education and training related to use and operation of the
              collection. In addition, this award will support the implementation of
              lyophilization and other long-term storage means to circumvent the use of
              serial culture.
