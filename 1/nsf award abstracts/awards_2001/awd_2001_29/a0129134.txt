Abstract    :
              This research involves using vertical temperature measurements from available
              sonde stations and from the space-based Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) to
              determine the altitudes and geographic locations expected to be optimal for
              detecting long-term changes.

Both radiosonde profiles of atmospheric
              temperature and MSU estimates of lower and upper tropospheric temperatures will
              be used to characterize the variability and autocorrelation of the profile
              data.  This information will then be combined with general circulation model
              projections to discern the altitudes and locations at which significant climate
              changes might be detected earliest.  The methods follow statistical techniques
              previously applied to ozone and other geophysical data.

The ability to
              detect the atmospheric changes expected to accompany increasing levels of
              greenhouse gases can assist the climate community in accurately attributing the
              environmental effects and may help quantify the extent to which these changes
              are due to anthropogenic components.  The results will help determine if the
              projected changes should be detectable either currently, or in the near future.
               The techniques can also quantify the advantage of improved data accuracy in
              reducing the time to detect trends.  The work is important in terms of
              developing realistic expectations for the detection of climate change.
