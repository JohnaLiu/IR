                                                                         This workshop brings
              together 30 teams of awardees funded by NSF under the 2000 ETI initiative to   
                          discuss and disseminate the results of the exploratory research. 
              The research targeted a broad class                 of complex engineering
              systems in the modern service industry:  those that transport of people, goods,
                           energy, and information, including highways, railways, air
              transport, shipping, gas-, fuel-, and                     water distribution
              pipelines, power distribution grids, communications networks and the Internet. 
                              The workshop, scheduled for August 13-14, 2001 in Washington,
              DC, is also intended to foster a                      sense of community among
              the participants which would lead to cross-fertilization of ideas belonging    
                        to the different fields of engineering.
