Abstract    :
              Proposal No.#0129530 PI: Hastings, Mardi   This project supports a workshop
              that is designed to encourage retention and advancement of qualified women and
              underrepresented minority-engineering educators in pursuit of scientific and
              engineering challenges.  The workshop will bring together a select group of 80
              of the nation's outstanding engineering educators who predominately have been
              in tenure track positions for less than five years or are in jthelast year of
              their Ph.D. program and actively pursuing tenure track academic positions.  The
              participants will be employed in teaching and/or research positions and
              actively developing their own unique research programs.  Specific workshop
              goals are to: I) foster technical and intellectual exchange among Ph.D. level,
              underrepresented and minority engineers who are or desire to be engineering
              educators; II) instill in its participants the sense of a technical community
              in which they can thrive and to which they can contribute; and III) increase
              participant awareness of research and funding
              opportunities.																 The workshop will consist of ten formal
              sessions spread over a three-day period emphasize the integration of research
              and education presentations on funding opportunities from agencies such as NSF,
              ARO, AFOSR, ONR, DARPA, and NASA.  A panel of university deans will discuss
              their perspectives on reasonable career expectations and demands, include the
              discussion of issues related to tenure, teaching, research, publications,
              funding, outreach and a rewarding personal life along the career path of an
              engineering educator.  The workshop proceeding will summarize the
              recommendations from the working session discussions, provide a workshop
              outcomes ass4esment and recommendations statement, and include a two page
              abstract from each participant that describes their research interest.  The
              envisioned significance and benefits of the workshop are the increased
              retention of women and underrepresented minority engineers as active
              researchers and educators and development of infrastructures of colleagues is
              the same field that is a rich diversity.
