This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in
              polymer sciences involves researchers and students at the University of Akron
              and University of Paris Sud.  Alexei Sokolov and Christiane Alba-Simonesco lead
              the US and French efforts respectively.  They will perform experimental studies
              of polymer dynamics using light and neutron scattering techniques, dielectric
              and calorimetric measurements.  The investigations focus on dependence of
              dynamics in polymeric systems, on molecular architecture, pressure, and aging. 
              The four experimental techniques cover extremely broad frequency ranges and
              provide a bridge between fast molecular motion and macroscopic properties,
              between dynamic and thermodynamic quantities in polymeric systems.  The Akron
              team will perform the light scattering experiments.  This is complemented by
              neutron scattering experiments at the Institute Laue Langevin and dielectric
              and calorimetric measurements performed at University of Paris Sud.

This
              award represents the US side of joint proposals to the NSF and the French
              National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds
              and living expenses of the US investigators and students.  The CNRS will
              support visits to the US of the French participants. The program trains
              graduate students on different techniques at large international facilities. 
              The collaboration will advance understanding of polymer dynamics in the high
              frequency range and development of new plastics for high frequency applications
              in information, computer and communication technologies.
