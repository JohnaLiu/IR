Abstract    :
              This project studies how labor market institutions affect labor market outcomes
              such as the level of unemployment, the duration of unemployment spells and
              wages. The divergence of European and American labor market experiences over
              the last twenty-five years in the presence of sharply different labor market
              institutions has motivated many earlier studies on this topic. This research
              finds that previous studies have overlooked a key channel through which labor
              market institutions affect labor market outcomes. In particular, this research
              finds that the uncertainty inherent in the hiring process is key to
              understanding how labor market institutions such as employment protection and
              wage compression affect outcomes. This finding also allows us to understand the
              differential evolution of European and American labor markets over the last
              twenty-five years. As the role of manufacturing began to diminish resources
              were shifted into new activities. Job creation in these new activities involved
              much more uncertainty than job creation using the established technologies that
              were embedded in activity in the manufacturing sector. As a result it is during
              this period that the European style labor market institutions started to have a
              large effect on the performance  of European labor markets relative to the
              United States.
