Abstract    :
              The aim of this International symposium is to provide a forum for the discussion
              of developments in nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. Nonlinear systems are at
              the center of many engineering disciplines.  Their analysis and design have
              made tremendous progress over the last decade with the development of new tools
              in nonlinear and stochastic dynamics.  In turn, problems in nonlinear mechanics
              have stimulated important research in mathematical systems theory.  Practical
              applications of fundamental results in these areas are beginning to appear
              across the entire spectrum of science. Research in this area is characterized
              by international and interdisciplinary cooperation.  The symposium will review
              both fundamental theory and its applications in structural and mechanical
              systems, fluid-structure interactions, and other areas of mechanics, science
              and technology.    The workshop is being organized and hosted for the
              International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM) by researchers
              at University Illinois at Urbana-Champagne, August 25-31, 2002.  Fifty speakers
              will be invited to present talks at this five-day symposium. These include
              speakers from the US, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Denmark, Italy,
              Russia, Austria, Poland, Czech Republic, Norway, India, China, Australia, South
              Africa, and Vietnam.  The Proceedings of the Symposium will be published under
              the title "IUTAM Symposium on NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC DYNAMICS" by Kluwer Academic
              Publishers; the official designated publisher of International Union of
              Theoretical and Applied Mechanics(IUTAM) Proceedings.
