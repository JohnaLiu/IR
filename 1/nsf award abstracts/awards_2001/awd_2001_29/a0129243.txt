Nochetto
This award supports Ricardo H. Nochetto and students from the
              University of Maryland-College Park in a collaboration with Gerhard Dziuk of
              the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Freiburg, Germany. 
              The award is a one-year renewal of a project begun in January 2000.  The
              project focuses on error control for nonlinear partial differential equations
              via a posteriori error estimation.  The techniques will have applications for
              physical problems involving diffusion, advection, phase changes, and interface
              dynamics.  Such problems arise frequently in industrial applications, and raise
              fundamental and challenging questions that need to be addressed in order for
              the field to advance.  The collaboration combines complementary expertise and
              facilities on both sides.  In particular the innovative software toolbox
              ALBERT, developed by the German group, is central to the proposed work, which
              will gain added value from the powerful theoretical capabilities of the U.S.
              group.  The work plan provides for extensive participation by graduate students
              in the international travel and research.
