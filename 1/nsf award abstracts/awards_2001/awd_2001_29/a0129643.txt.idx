Abstract    :
              This project, submitted under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
              program, explores an emerging issue in the relationship between law and
              bureaucratic institutions, namely, the shift from public to private
              arrangements for the production of welfare law. The private domain has assumed
              new significance in the aftermath of welfare reform, which has produced a
              virtual explosion in private contracting of public welfare functions relating
              to welfare's work provisions. This exploratory project investigates the private
              construction of law within "contract bureaucracies," agencies that perform
              essentially public welfare functions but do so outside the organizational
              boundaries of government. It extends research on the informal institutional
              practices through which law acquires specific meaning beyond the public sector.
              As a study of the construction of practical legal meaning, this inquiry is
              concerned, not with legal ideals or intent, but with the creation of legal
              realities. Case study research will be conducted in two private organizations
              contracted to provide welfare-to-work services. The cases will be purposefully
              selected to permit comparison with the researcher's public agency studies and
              to allow comparison with each other. This inquiry will utilize the methodology
              of street-level analysis, combining in-depth interview techniques often used by
              organization researchers with direct observation more commonly used in
              ethnography. The objective of this form of analysis is to reconstruct agency
              practice in terms of its own internal logic and to explain the particular form
              that law takes in specific settings.
