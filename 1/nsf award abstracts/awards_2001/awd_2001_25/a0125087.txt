Abstract    :
              EarthTalk Incorporated will be producing three seasons of "I Wonder," 225
              ninety-second radio programs that answer listeners' questions about science.  
              Questions will be collected from listeners via the projects' web site, by mail,
              and during special "field recording events" in which questions are solicited
              from museum visitors at nine science centers across the nation.  Each program
              will feature a listener's science question with its answer provided by
              interviews with scientists/experts.   "I Wonder" will be carried on the over
              700 public and commercial radio stations that currently broadcast the
              producers' "Earth and Sky" radio series.

Ancillary support for the series
              will be provided by a special "I Wonder" section of Earth & Sky Online and
              direct mailing of the nine "I Wonder" CDs to 90,000 classroom teachers. 
              Promotion for the series will include placement of print ads that are timed
              with the field recording events.
