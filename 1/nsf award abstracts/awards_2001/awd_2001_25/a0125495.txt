The project will focus on combined petrographic and geochemical
              analyses of altered rock core recovered from a deep drill hole near Hilo, on
              the Big Island of Hawaii.  Some of this material comes from a 3 km-deep drill
              hole completed by the Hawaii Scientific Drilling Project (HSDP) in September,
              1999.  The reminder will come from new samples that will be recovered when the
              existing hole is deepened, beginning in early 2003.  The primary objective of
              this project will be to develop and test models for rock alteration using an
              integrated analytical approach for studying the recovered core materials. 
              Major questions to be addressed are: (1) What is the alteration history of the
              basaltic material which underlies Mauna Kea volcano, how has it been influenced
              by various types of alteration processes, and are these distinct from other
              forms of seafloor alteration?  (2) How has this alteration affected the mineral
              composition and physical properties of these materials?  (3) How significantly
              has alteration affected the chemical composition of the submarine portions of
              the Mauna Kea? and (4) What is the evidence regarding (proposed models
              invoking) deep circulation of ground waters within the interior of this
              volcano?  Questions # 1 and 2 will be addressed through the systematic study of
              the alteration mineralogy.  Question #3 and 4 will be addressed by detailed
              geochemical investigations of elemental and isotopic signatures associated with
              the conversion of basaltic minerals and glass to palagonitized glass, layer
              silicates, and zeolites.  Trace element and isotopic analyses will provide the
              means of evaluating the exchange of basaltic, seawater, meteoric components
              during alteration.  Stable isotopic analyses of alteration minerals should
              allow us to test a hydrologic model suggesting that meteoric fluids have
              circulated deep within the interior of Mauna Kea.
