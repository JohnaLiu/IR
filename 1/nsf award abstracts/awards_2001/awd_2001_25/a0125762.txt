Abstract    :
              The Space Science Institute (SSI) seeks to develop the "Stardust Project,"
              designed to introduce the public to concepts related to the birth of stars, the
              search for planets beyond our solar system and the search for life beyond
              earth.  The project's three components include a 2,500 square-foot travelling
              exhibition called "Stardust:  Our Search for Origins;" a comprehensive
              education program for museum staff and grades 4-9 school teachers and a public
              Web site that incorporates and builds on the exhibit and education
              content.

The project proposes to assemble standards-based educational
              materials for dissemination through workshops conducted at museums that host
              the exhibit.  The educational programs -- particularly professional development
              workshops for teachers -- target, among other groups, underserved Native
              American and Hispanic teachers associated with a partnership between SSI and
              the NSF Rural Systematic Initiatives in the American West.

The project is
              built around strong partnerships with two NASA Origins Program missions and
              with established informal education institutions including the New York Hall of
              Science, the Lawrence Hall of Science, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,
              TERC and the SETI Institute.  Its goals are to make it possible for teachers,
              students and the public to learn about:

	The formation of stars, planets,
              and the solar system;
	The conditions necessary for life;
	The effect of life
              on Earth's environment;
	The methods used to detect planets orbiting distant
              stars and
	The scientific tools used in origin research -- from space-based
              telescopes to microscopes.
