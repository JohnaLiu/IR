Abstract    :
                   This collaborative project is a modeling study of thermobaric instability
              in the ocean, and its effect on deep convection in the Southern Ocean.
              Thermobaric instability refers to the fact that the compressibility of sea
              water is a non-linear function of pressure, so that a colder and fresher layer
              overlying a warmer and a saltier layer may be statically stable, but become
              unstable if it is disturbed.  That this is theoretically possible has been
              known for a long time, but only recently has it been considered as an effect
              that could actually occur in the Southern Ocean, specifically as the potential
              explanation of the episodic occurrence of polynyas (sizable areas of open water
              within the sea-ice pack) in the Weddell Sea.
    This evaluation of the impact
              of thermobaricity on deep ocean convection will be based on a numerical Large
              Eddy Simulation (LES) model capable of simulating directly the convection
              plumes and large scale oceanic flow features that would be expected with
              intense thermobaric overturn.  Based on preliminary results of an LES model
              initialized and forced by conditions observed during previous oceanographic
              cruises to the Weddell Sea, this proposed work will combine a carefully
              structured series of model runs with observations to identify critical
              overturning processes.
