Abstract    :
              The Greater Washington Educational Telecommunications Association (WETA) in
              partnership with BBC2 and the Open University, is producing ten half-hour
              television programs that explore the reality of scientific discovery.  In each
              episode, five scientists who have been abandoned on a deserted island solve
              science-based challenges using only their collective expertise, wits, the
              island's resources and a few basic tools.  In one episode, for instance, the
              scientists will need to:  1) calculate their location with the exact latitude
              and longitude, 2) create insect repellant, and 3) design and build a homemade
              radio.  The programs capture both the disappointments of experiments that go
              wrong as well as the joy and excitement of success.

The television series
              will be supported by "Rough Science Adventures," field experiences where
              members of the public solve challenges similar to those facing the scientists
              in the television program, and by a Rough Science website.  Outreach partners
              include the New York Hall of Science, the National Society of Black Engineers,
              and the International Educational Technology Association.
