Abstract    :
              This study will provide a three-year, in depth, longitudinal analysis of
              students' development as mathematical learners in reform-oriented mathematics
              classrooms during the middle school years.  For the purposes of this study,
              reform is defined as a teacher's use of instructional practices and curricular
              materials that aligned with the NCTM's Curriculum and Teaching Standards and
              the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics.   

The overall purpose
              of this research is to examine the ways in which mathematics reform affects
              students' development as mathematics knowers and learners.  The study will
              document changes in students' learning and self-conceptions, as well as the
              processes by which this change occurs.

The primary research questions
              guiding the work are:

1. What are the direct and indirect effects of teacher
              practice, classroom and student level processes on students' conceptual
              understanding, achievement and identify development in mathematics?

2. How
              are the effects of teacher practice, and classroom and student level processes
              on students' conceptual understanding and identify development moderated by
              gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status?
