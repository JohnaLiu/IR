Abstract    :
              0125746 Donovan	 	 This award is to Montana Tech (Lead Institution) to
              support the activity described below for 24 months.  The proposal was submitted
              in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF
              0179).  Partners The partners for the award are Montana Tech, Montana
              Department of Commerce, Montana State University-Northern, Structural Dynamics
              Research Corporation, PFM Manufacturing, S&K Electronics, Lincoln Electric
              Company.  Proposed Activities The activities for the project include:
              developing systems through which educational resources can be rapidly deployed
              to the widely distributed population of Montana, creating virtual organizations
              through which independent organizations efficiently combine core competencies
              to attain strategic market advantages, development of on-line courses in
              concurrent engineering and collaborative commerce, establishment of procedures
              and systems through which Montana's private industry can rapidly and
              efficiently for mutually beneficial collaborations with units of the Montana
              University System, and advancement of the state-of-the-art in collaborative
              methodologies.  Proposed Innovation The proposed innovation is the
              development and establishment of state-of-the-art systems and methodologies for
              collaborative virtual organizations to promote combination of core competencies
              for a rural economy that is widely dispersed.  Potential Economic Impact The
              proposed economic impact is the potential to increase the ability of small
              companies to respond to opportunities for business by combining their core
              competencies in virtual organizations.  The average company size in Montana is
              12 employees and the ability of any one company to meet the talents needed to
              compete is limited to its talent pool.  Combinations of talents from several
              companies increases the opportunity to respond to business opportunities on an
              ad hoc basis.   Potential Societal Impact The economy of Montana is
              dominated by farm income which has remained constant for more than 20 years. 
              The average company size in the state is 12 employees.  The population is
              sparsely dispersed.  Increased business revenue that will result from these
              companies becoming more competitive will create much-needed wealth for
              stability and growth.  The project involves underrepresented minorities,
              especially native Americans in the business enterprise of Montana
