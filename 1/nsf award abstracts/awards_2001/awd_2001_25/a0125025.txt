Abstract    :
              We will develop techniques that can be used to understand the biology and
              ecology of rare and endangered species without direct observations or
              experiments on those species.  Rare and endangered species are often difficult
              to study because their populations are very small and because direct
              observations and experiments can harm the species.  We will apply geochemical
              and paleontological methods to the analysis of shells and bones in museum
              collections, archeological sites and natural accumulations.  We will use growth
              lines in bones and teeth to determine age spans and growth rates.  We will use
              the geochemistry of the bones and shells to determine diet, water sources, and
              salinity.  We will examine three rare and endangered species in the northern
              Gulf of California: the Colorado delta clam (a mollusk), the totoaba (a fish)
              and the Gulf of California harbor porpoise (a marine mammal).  These species
              are endangered by either direct human activity or through environmental changes
              caused by the near-complete diversion of Colorado River water for human uses. 
              The techniques developed and tested in this project may be applied to the
              conservation biology and restoration of other rare and endangered species.
