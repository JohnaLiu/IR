Abstract    :
              The project combines field and experimental approaches to investigate the
              sources,
transformations, transport, and fates of dissolved, particulate and
              sedimentary organic matter in the
Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. This project will
              take advantage of the specificity that molecular organic
markers of organisms
              and their processes can provide to understand how the Western Arctic
              shelves
produce, metabolize and sequester carbon, a question central for the
              SBI program. The proposed studies
are closely linked with proposed research in
              other SBI phase II projects as well as international programs to
give an
              integrated, pan-Arctic view of C and N cycling. The proposed research is
              directed by the
following central hypotheses:  1) On time scales of physical
              transport across the shelf-basin boundary and interior ocean (years to
              decades), terrestrial organic matter contains specific, conservative biomarkers
              that trace riverine discharge; 2) Biological processing in shelf waters
              dictates the molecular signatures of organic matter deposited in sediments and
              exported to the Basin; 3) Episodic marine primary production fuels benthic
              production.
