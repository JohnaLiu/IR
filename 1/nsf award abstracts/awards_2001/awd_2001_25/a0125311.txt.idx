Abstract    :
              Under the direction of Dr. Prudence Rice, Mr. William Duncan will collect data
              for his doctoral dissertation. Mr. Duncan has participated in long term NSF
              supported archaeological to reconstruct late prehistoric population
              distribution and social organization in the Peten lakes region of northern
              Guatemala. After devolution of classic Mayan civilization in this region, local
              Mayan groups nucleated into smaller social entities until their ultimate
              conquest by the Spanish. Through combined archaeological, historical and
              ethnographic work the team has traced continuities through time and correlated
              late prehistoric and extant Mayan populations. This provides an excellent
              opportunity to trace change over time and evaluate, for example,  the impact of
              such events as the classic Mayan "collapse" and the Spanish conquest. Dr.
              Duncan will focus on burial ritual. Because burials - both skeletal remains and
              associated grave offerings - are often well preserved in the archaeological
              record they are the focus of considerable scientific attention. Most societies
              have strict rules governing their form and through analysis of grave remains it
              is often possible to work backwards and reconstruct multiple aspects of social
              organization. In the course of the Northern Peten work, many burials from
              multiple Postclassic groups have been recovered. With NSF support, Mr. Duncan
              will expand and analyze this sample. He has noted that burials vary along
              multiple axes. Some are "domestic" and associated with individual dwellings.
              Others are multiple in nature and likely took place in a broader civic context.
              Within this latter distinct variants are evident. Based on both Middle American
              and world wide ethnographic comparison it is postulated that different burial
              variants served different purposes: in some cases the goal was to move the soul
              onwards to an afterlife. In others, the reverse was the case. Based on an
              ethnographically derived set of criteria Mr. Duncan will analyze methods of
              burial and compare them across different contexts and different social groups.
              He will also conduct an analyses of the skeletons themselves and use a set of
              discrete dental traits with a high degree of heritability to examine degree of
              relationship among and between individuals.   This research is important for
              several reasons. It will provide insight into prehistoric Mayan social
              organization and the results will be of interest to many Middle Americanists.
              Through a unique combination of archaeological and biological approaches it
              will help to develop an analytic technique of potentially wide applicability.
              Finally it will assist in training a promising young scientist.
