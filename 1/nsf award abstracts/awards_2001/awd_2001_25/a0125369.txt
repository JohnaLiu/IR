This project is implementing online homework for
              lower division mathematics courses (Intermediate and College Algebra, College
              Mathematics, Finite Mathematics, Precalculus, Business Math I & II, and Brief
              Calculus) using WeBWork, a program developed at the University of Rochester.
              These courses service on average over 6500 students each semester. The primary
              objective of instituting online homework is to increase student learning in
              these courses. Additionally, student attitudes about their introductory
              mathematics courses are being improved by use of this system and by giving
              students an initial exposure to technology in their college education. To
              implement WeBWork, the project is developing libraries of problems for courses
              and training instructional personnel to use the system and to produce their own
              problems. A distinctive feature of the problem libraries is the inclusion of
              more extensive feedback for students when compared with most existing WeBWork
              problems. Dissemination is taking place through local workshops held for other
              educators and conference presentations. Assessment of student performance and
              attitudes is integrated into the entire project.
