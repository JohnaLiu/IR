Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

This is a collaborative project involving Drury
              University, Central Missouri State University, and Lamar University Beaumont.
              Despite efforts of the Calculus Reform movement, in some institutions, the
              success rate of students in calculus remains low. Problem-based learning has
              proven to be an effective pedagogical technique which addresses a diversity of
              learning styles, but there are no published materials for teaching the calculus
              sequence using it.

This project is completing the writing of texts for
              teaching Calculus I, II, and III using a problem-based learning approach, the
              modified Moore method, and incorporating an appropriate usage of technology.
              McGraw-Hill has published Calculus I, A Discovery Workbook, written by two of
              the investigators, and expresses interest in publishing Calculus II and III as
              well. Activities include assessment of the effectiveness of this method and
              dissemination of the results in faculty development workshops. The
              investigators and the advisory board members are innovativors in the use of
              problem-based teaching and learning and are active in discussing this method in
              the broader mathematical community and in disseminating materials for use in
              problem-based courses.
