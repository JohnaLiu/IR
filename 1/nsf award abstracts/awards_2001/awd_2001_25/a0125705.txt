This grant provides support for refinements to the
              widely-used Isoplot/Ex, a MS Excel-based computer program used for reduction
              and evaluation of radiogenic isotope data.  The program will be expanded to
              include several new capabilities including: 1) a Bayesian + Monte Carlo
              approach for improving the precision of radiometric dates from a sequence of
              stratigraphically-constrained beds; 2) a method for logical, statistical, and
              graphical integration of the two main Ar-Ar age-approaches (stepwise-release
              age-spectra and Ar-Ar isochrons); 3) a Gaussian unmixing module to enable
              quantitative evaluation of age-suites involving multiple age-components; 4)
              code revisions to maintain compatibility with new versions of Excel and
              eliminate bugs as they are detected; and 5) expansion and revision of the
              Isoplot User's Manual to increase clarity and teaching effectiveness.
