This project will develop and implement a comprehensive data
              management strategy for the western Arctic Shelf-Basin Interactions (SBI) Phase
              II field program.  This work will take place in collaboration with the SBI
              Project Office and the scientific investigators who are to provide datasets and
              information.  The data management program will help ensure that data are
              accurate, accessible, well-documented, and disseminated in a timely fashion to
              scientific users.  Initial preparation of the program will be assisted by
              results from a questionnaire that will be sent out to all involved parties
              including scientific investigators and project managers.  These results will
              help in establishing database structure and to determine operational data
              needs.  An on-line field catalog will support field activities and will contain
              field reports and data products for review and exchange during the progression
              of the field programs.  Information included in the catalog is anticipated to
              include satellite images and early data products that may be useful to other
              ongoing work.  Experience with past large research projects has shown that data
              management components such as this are essential to effective database
              generation and data dissemination, while the field catalog can be very helpful
              in project coordination and in optimizing field sampling.
