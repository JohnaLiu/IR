Abstract    :
              This project will take a research-informed approach to understanding how
              undergraduate engineering majors progress in their studies of engineering
              design.  Its goal is to better understand  and describe design expertise and a
              learner's growth towards acquiring that expertise.  In this work, the
              investigators intend to undertake research in three areas:
(1) The development
              of a continuum of design expertise as a way of describing learners' growth
              toward acquiring expertise, (2) A study of design expertise that will provide
              information to help populate the continuum, and (3) The demonstration of a
              research-informed approach in design education through the use of the continuum
              to enhance and assess student
learning of engineering design during their
              cooperative (coop) experiences. This research should help us to better
              understand how students learn design principles in engineering, and the
              continuum, itself, may be of great help to engineering faculty in their efforts
              to teach design.
