This
              Collaborative Research proposal between the UC Santa Barbara and the University
              of Southern Mississippi will establish a regional stratigraphic structural and
              geochronological framework for Miocene volcanic rocks of the northern to
              central Sierra Nevada, and at the same time reconstruct structural settings and
              volcanological processes. The main motivation is to evaluate the tectonic
              significance and relationship of these mid-Miocene volcanic rocks to modern and
              ancient subduction, Basin and Range extension, and hotspot settings. Detailed
              volcanic and sedimentary lithofacies maps will be produced and used to
              determine the nature and timing of synvolcanic faulting. Petrography, image
              analysis and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) imaging of the Sierran breccias
              will be employed to study and quantify clast and matrix types, morphologies,
              dimensions and fragmentation styles (brittle, ductile, transitional), and
              results will be compared with published examples of volcanic breccias of all
              plausible origins. Preliminary XRF geochemical analysis of representative
              suites (including all samples to be dated) will be completed and compared with
              compositions of clasts with matrices in the breccias. To test for geological
              consistency in our age data, sampling for 40Ar/39Ar geochronology will
              concentrate on stratigraphic successions containing at least three or four
              different datable units. Ar geochronology of single mineral grains (total
              fusions) as well as incremental step heating experiments will be completed.
