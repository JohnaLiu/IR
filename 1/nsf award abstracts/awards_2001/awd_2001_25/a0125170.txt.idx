              DMS-0125170 Paul M. N. Feehan  The principal goal of our research is to prove
              the celebrated  formula of Edward Witten (1994), relating the Donaldson and
              Seiberg-Witten series of smooth four-manifolds. Witten used  quantum field
              theory methods to derive his celebrated formula,  based on the concept of
              `duality', whereas the approach we  have been pursuing jointly with Thomas
              Leness is a mathematical  one, employing a moduli space of non-abelian
              monopoles as a  cobordism between links of Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten
               moduli spaces. We have already partially verified Witten's  formula using
              this approach, showing that in many cases the  series agree up through terms
              of order depending only on  the topology of the four-manifold. We aim to build
              on  those results, by showing next that a relation between the  two series of
              the overall expected shape exists and then  applying auxiliary techniques to
              prove that his formula is  the only one possible.  A second goal of our
              research is to develop a proof of Witten's formula, in the special case of
               symplectic four-manifolds equipped with Lefschetz fibrations,  and shed
              light on the relationship between Seiberg-Witten  invariants, Donaldson
              invariants, and the structure of Lefschetz fibrations. Ultimately, we also hope
              to explain the relationship between the mathematical and quantum field theory
              methods of  deriving Witten's formula.  Witten's formula, as understood by
              mathematicians, is part of a physical theory developed by Witten and Nathan
              Seiberg relating non-abelian Yang-Mills theory (a generalization of Maxwell's
               theory of electromagnetics) and the simpler abelian Seiberg-Witten gauge
              field theories. In the physical world, quantum Yang-Mills theories provide a
              theoretical basis for describing elementary  particle interactions. In the
              mathematical world, beginning with  the work of Simon Donaldson in 1983,
              classical Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten gauge theories have played a
              fundamental role  in probing the geometry of four-dimensional spaces.
              String theory is often cited by physicists as the most promising  candidate
              for a unification of quantum field theory (itself  is a unification of the
              electromagnetic, weak, and strong  forces) and Einstein's theory of gravity.
              Such a `grand  unified theory' would give a single theoretical framework  for
              explaining both short-range, high-energy elementary  particle interactions and
              the long-range gravitational force.  However, discovery of such a unified
              framework has eluded  physicists for nearly three-quarters of a century.
              Furthermore,  while Einstein's theory of gravity is founded on rigorous
               mathematics, the goal of providing a mathematical foundation  for quantum
              field theory has not yet been realized. Most  physicists agree that particle
              accelerators of impossibly  large size would be needed to experimentally
              verify that  string theory is the `right' theory of nature. However,  while
              independent, mathematical verifications of quantum field theory predictions
              can never replace experimental tests,  they may increase our confidence that
              quantum field theory  predictions are correct when experimental checks are
              impossible  with current technology. We hope that our project may serve as a
               small step in such directions.
