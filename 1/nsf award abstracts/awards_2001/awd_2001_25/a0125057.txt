Large anorthosite bodies associated with
              high-grade regional metamorphism and anatectites are nearly restricted to
              orogens of Precambrian age.  They may indicate different conditions for
              Precambrian tectonics or different circumstances of plate interactions, however
              to test various models for their formation an accurate temporal framework for
              the development of metamorphism, anatexis, melt accumulations and emplacement
              in orogens is required.  This project will utilize the well studied Adirondack
              sector of the Grenville orogeny which contains classic anorthosite plutons to
              develop a detailed chronology of events.  Results are expected to produce
              sufficient data to test models of anorthosite development, which will have
              applications in other Precambrian orogenic belts.
