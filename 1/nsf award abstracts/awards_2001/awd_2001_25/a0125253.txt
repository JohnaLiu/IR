Geomagnetic paleointensity data from Proterozoic and Archean
              rocks can provide insight into the origin and early history of the Earth's
              magnetic field. This interval is of particular interest because it may mark the
              time of growth of the solid inner core. However, paleointensity measurements
              are difficult because of alteration induced during standard (Thellier)
              laboratory heating procedures. The investigators have developed an approach to
              measure paleointensity using single plagioclase crystals that has potential for
              studying the early geodynamo. Plagioclase crystals, which contain
              nanometer-sized magnetic inclusions, are less susceptible to experimental
              alteration than many bulk-rock samples. Preliminary rock magnetic and Thellier
              analyses of plagioclase crystals separated from 2.45 billion-year-old mafic
              dikes from Karelia (Russia), provide the basis for this work. They propose
              field and laboratory programs to obtain time-averaged paleointensity data based
              on single plagioclase crystals from Proterozoic and Archean dikes of Karelia
              and the Superior Province (Canada). These data will be used to test hypotheses
              concerning the early geomagnetic field, including whether a stepwise increase
              in paleointensity occurred related to inner core growth, and whether the early
              field had large octupole components. This work includes support for a
              postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and several undergraduate
              students.
