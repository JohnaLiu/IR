              ABSTRACT

OCE: 0125306

The study will measure sedimentary denitrification
              rates at selected sites in the Chukchi-Beaufort continental shelf regions of
              the Artic Ocean as part of the Shelf Basin Initiative (SBI).  Overall
              denitrification  by  facultative anaerobic bacteria in this region is a
              function of several factors including the oxygenation state of underlying
              sediments, spatial and temporal variation in organic matter inputs, bottom
              water nitrate concentrations, and the rates of sedimentary bioturbation and
              bioirrigation as well as water column processes. Denitrification along the wide
              Artic shelves is currently estimated to be a significant portion of the global
              oceanic denitrification rate and additionally responsible for consuming a
              significant fraction of the pan-Artic inorganic nitrogen budget.
              Denitrification in this region will likely be subject to the impact of global
              climate change brought about by either altered circulation patterns, such as
              changing inflow patterns of high nutrient Pacific waters through the Bering
              Straits, or climate driven changes in ecosystem structure and function
              resulting from altered sea-ice distributions. In order to better understand the
              present variability of nitrogen cycling in this Arctic shelf basin, the
              investigators will extend a  limited number of denitrification rate
              measurements previously made in the region, and relate these to one or more of 
              a number of contributing environmental drivers.
