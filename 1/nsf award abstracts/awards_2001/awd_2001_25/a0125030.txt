Abstract    :
              The proposal plans to connect CAU to the Abilene Network via SoX in support of 
              the following research and education:
high-throughput computing, 
video
              object coding and tracking,
computational analysis of protein structure and
              folding
IP multicast for Access grid technology

Clark-Atlanta will also
              connect the Morehouse School of Medicine to Abilene and advanced network
              services via this award.
