Abstract    :
              The Bell Museum of Natural History is seeking a planning grant to begin the
              exhibit development process for a national traveling exhibit on nature in urban
              settings.  "Nature in the City" will be designed to encourage the exploration
              of diversity of life in the city in the same way ecologist study ecosystems.
              The overall goal of the exhibit is to improve the public's understanding of
              ecology and biodiversity, and the relevance of these concepts to their lives in
              creating healthier and ecologically sustainable communities.   The project will
              include front-end evaluation, identification of key themes and take-home
              messages, and a survey of potential host sites.  The target audience assessment
              will examine interest, knowledge and attitudes about nature and the environment
              among urban audiences. Methodology will include interviews with community
              members, focus groups and surveys, all conducted in collaboration with museum
              staff and community groups.  The results will be applied to the design of the
              3000 sq. ft. "Nature in the City" traveling exhibit, mini-kiosks and supporting
              programs.
