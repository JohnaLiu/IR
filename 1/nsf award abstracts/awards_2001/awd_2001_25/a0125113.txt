This project aims to determine the effect that
              melting had on the world-class lead-zinc ore deposit at Broken Hill, Australia,
              which was metamorphosed at granulite facies, well within the range of melting
              for the pure Pb-Zn-Fe-Ag-S system. We plan to study the textures, assemblages
              and mineral compositions within the ore body and its alteration halo to see if
              the relations observed can be explained by reactions between the country rock
              and a crystallizing and differentiating polymetallic melt.  We plan to use
              trace element geochemistry to determine if the pyroxenoid horizon around the
              ore crystallized from the polymetallic melt.  It will also determine if the
              high-variance assemblages around the ore body that involve garnet could have
              been produced by fluids that were released from the melt during crystallization
              of the pyroxenoids.  It also intends to study assemblages within the ore body
              to see if they record a liquid line of descent, with the melt becoming enriched
              in incompatible elements, Ag, Au, As, Bi, Sb, and Tl, during differentiation.
