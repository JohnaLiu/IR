Abstract    :
              Engineering - Electrical (55)
This project is designed to stimulate interest in
              engineering and increase retention in engineering programs by developing a
              web-based laboratory course that enhances the freshman engineering experience.
              In this course, students complete a comprehensive, hands-on project, in this
              case a robot, incorporating a broad spectrum of concepts that will be expanded
              in detail in subsequent advanced courses. The courseware/laboratory system
              design consists of WebLAB, which is web-based courseware with built-in
              instrument controls, and the e-LAB instrumentation device, which is a
              computer-controlled laboratory instrument box connected between a test circuit
              wired on a protoboard and the student's computer. The web-based courseware
              contains all the engineering concepts and instructions to successfully build a
              robot and to understand all aspects of its operation. The modules contain
              background material, tutorials, structured questions, calculations and
              verifications of theory, graphing tools, laboratory report preparation through
              the use of templates, report questions that require independent and
              collaborative research, experiment evaluation and feedback, and integrated
              assessment tools for evaluating module effectiveness. Project assessment
              includes content and delivery evaluation by faculty and students at this
              institution and at two other diverse institutions. Results are disseminated by
              publications and conference presentations, and courseware is widely available
              on the internet and easily adaptable by other engineering and technical
              institutions.
