This award supports a project to analyze samples from the
              Law Dome ice core for volcanic tephra.  The Law Dome ice core is the best-dated
              ice core from East Antarctica and contains a detailed record of climate and
              atmospheric chemistry over at least the last 700 years.  Several global
              volcanic eruptions appear to be recorded in the Law Dome core, including the
              well known Tambora 1815 and Unknown 1809 events, as well as the Huaynaputina
              1600 and Ruiz 1595 events.  To verify the source eruptions responsible for
              these signals, as well as to differentiate between local Antarctic and southern
              hemisphere eruptions, a continuous scan for volcanic glass at an annual
              resolution will be done on the last 700 years of the Law Dome ice core.
              Sub-annual tephra analyses will be done in the sections containing the largest
              acid signals in the core.  To better evaluate the climatic impact of large
              equatorial eruptions from ice cores, it is necessary to isolate local eruptions
              and their associated glaciochemical signal from that of these more distant
              sources.  The identification of local eruptions in the Law Dome core will
              improve upon the existing chronology of Antarctic volcanism over the last 700
              years through the presence of volcanic glass in conjunction with the results
              from this same type of study on the Siple Dome ice core.
