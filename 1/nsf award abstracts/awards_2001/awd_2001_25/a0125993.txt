The physical origins of pseudosingle-domain (PSD)
              behavior in small magnetic particles have been subjects of lively debate,
              because PSD grains are thought to carry much of the stable remanence in rocks.
              Two ingredients contribute most to PSD behavior: transitions in magnetic domain
              state and defects that pin domain walls. Despite the important role of defects
              having been recognized for decades, recent theories and experiments in rock
              magnetism underscore how little we understand about their impact on key
              problems such as domain wall nucleation, wall-pinning, the stabilities of
              remanences to alternating field (AF) demagnetization, acquisition of thermal
              remanent magnetization (TRM), and even the potential for extracting
              paleointensities from PSD grains of certain magnetic minerals. Single particles
              of judiciously-chosen magnetic minerals can provide "magnified" views of both
              nucleation events and wall-defect interactions. Owing mainly to its weak
              demagnetizing field and few domains, hematite is such a magnifier. This
              combination of properties opens up a window for studying the intrinsic impact
              of defects on magnetic behavior. We will use large, single platelets of
              hematite to better understand how defects control nucleation and domain wall
              pinning. Six sets of core experiments are proposed here. These would determine:
              (1) the thermal stability of SD-like (or near SD-like) states induced at room
              temperature; (2) domain states for weak-field TRM; (3) temperature dependences
              of nucleation fields; (4) temperature dependences of critical fields that unpin
              mature domain walls; (5) AF stabilities of truly multidomain hematite carrying
              strong-field remanence and weak-field anhysteretic magnetization, and (6) the
              frequency distribution of critical unpinning fields.
