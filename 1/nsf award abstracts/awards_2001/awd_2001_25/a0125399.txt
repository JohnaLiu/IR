Abstract    :
              This project will conduct service measurements for a three year Shelf Basin
              Interaction Phase II field program in 2002-04.  The service measurements
              include water temperature profiles, salinity, dissolved oxygen concentration,
              transmissivity, fluorescence and photosynthetically active radiation; inorganic
              nutrients (nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, silicate and ammonia), chlorophyll-a,
              salinity and dissolved oxygen concentrations; and underway measurements
              including temperature and salinity, standard meteorological observations,
              Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (velocity and backscatter), and various
              underway measurements made by SBI-designated science programs.  A full set of
              service measurements will be made on two cruises each year in 2002 and 2004 and
              on one cruise in 2003.  A limited set of measurements will be made on mooring
              emplacement cruises in FY 2002, 2003, and 2004.  All service measurement data
              resulting from the work will be available at sea to all SBI investigators in
              scientifically useful form and
will be placed on-line at a site linked to the
              UCAR Joint Office for Science Support (JOSS)
and/or delivered to JOSS (or
              other designated official data repository for the SBI Phase II Field
Program)
              via express service shortly after the conclusion of each cruise. Data will be
              reported in
preliminary, interim, and final form as appropriate for the SBI
              Project.
