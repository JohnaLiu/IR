In this project, the investigators will study
              rheological and elastic properties of mantle minerals by combining new radial
              x-ray diffraction techniques with Brillouin spectroscopy in a diamond anvil
              cell. Radial x-ray diffraction is a new high-pressure method that can constrain
              a wealth of information about single-crystal elastic constants, yield strength,
              strength anisotropy, stress continuity, texturing, and even the equation of
              state. Advantages of radial diffraction relative to other techniques for
              strength and elasticity determination are that the accessible pressure range
              reaches into the deep lower mantle and there is no requirement for high-quality
              single crystals. A major goal of this study is to explore the capabilities of
              radial x-ray diffraction by choosing a set of materials for which the
              investigators can simultaneously apply radial diffraction to 60 GPa and
              Brillouin scattering on single crystals to 20 GPa. This will provide a direct
              comparison of elasticity determined by the new lattice strain methods with
              well-established Brillouin techniques. Specific materials to be examined
              included perovskites, magnesiowustites, spinel, corundum, brucite, and calcium
              oxide. These results will have fundamental and wide applications to
              high-pressure studies and our understanding of the Earth's deep mantle.
