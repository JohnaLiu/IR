Experiments will be performed to determine the speciation and
              partitioning of gold and copper in felsic melts + vapor or brine (starting
              composition of KCl+NaCl+HCl+H2O) assemblages, some with added sulfur, at 800
              degrees C covering a range of pressures near 100 MPa.  Experiments performed in
              sulfide-saturated systems (e.g., pyrrhotite-intermediate solid solution
              assemblage) will be performed to determine copper and gold partitioning in
              vapor/melt, brine/melt and vapor+brine/melt assemblages. This effort
              complements experiments on crystal-melt partitioning of Au and Cu among
              magnetite and biotite, and rhyolite melt. Taken together with existing
              experimental data, the proposed research will yield a preliminary model for the
              behavior of Cu and Au in melt-crystal-vapor-brine systems that can be used to
              test hypotheses for the origin of porphyry and related Au-Cu deposits.  The
              melt-volatile phase experiments proposed here are in high demand given that the
              relative roles of  brine  versus  vapor  and  sulfur  versus  chloride-bearing 
              ligands are not clear in  light of  the pioneering analytical work on natural
              fluid inclusions by both Bodnar (1995) and Audetat et al. (1998).  These
              workers have suggested that both sulfur-bearing species and the vapor phase may
              be important in transporting these Cu and Au in ore-forming environments. Our
              study is designed to provide basic thermodynamic data to determine the controls
              on copper and gold partitioning in magmatic-hydrothermal systems and to clarify
              transport mechanisms for these economically important metals.
