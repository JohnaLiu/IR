Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99) Mathematics (21) Physics (13)
We are implementing an
              integrated physics and mathematics laboratory and classroom in which we extend
              cooperative learning models into a unified introductory physics and calculus
              course. We address several persistent problems in student learning: poor
              conceptualization and retention of material, underdeveloped problem-solving
              skills, and difficulty actively applying knowledge across disciplines. We are
              integrating and adapting materials and methods from several NSF funded projects
              (including Workshop Physics, integrated calculus and physics at University of
              New Hampshire, and peer-led team learning) and are building on successful
              projects at the University of Portland that use cooperative learning models. We
              are teaching a unified introductory math/physics course that encourages
              students to make connections across disciplines in the same environment using
              the same set of tools. Instructors in this course have greater flexibility in
              the timing of topics, at times focusing on building strong foundations and at
              others, establishing connections between the subjects. New equipment allows
              students to work in small groups on investigative activities with a supervising
              peer-leader and a faculty member overseeing the entire class. The design of the
              classroom allows faculty to unify lecture with hands-on learning and to
              integrate computer usage with group activities such as experimentation and
              joint problem-solving. The laboratory also is used in our education of math and
              physics students interested in K-12 teaching.
