Abstract    :
              Much remains to be understood about how small faults grow into large faults and
              how the propagate through the crust. Such knowledge has considerable
              significance for evaluation of seismic hazards and the exploration for
              petroleum. This study will address this issue through the construction and
              refinement of computer programs which simulate faulting and the growth of folds
              related to the faults. Two different approaches will be utilized and the
              combination of these should reveal aspects of the phenomenon which have not yet
              been determined. A limited set of field examples will be studied to determine
              the extent to which computer models produce realistic results.
