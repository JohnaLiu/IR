Abstract    :
              Reconstructing and modeling climate variations over the last 30,000 years or so
              is one of the most important goals of global  climate change research.  Only by
              determining how the global climate varied during this period can we begin to
              understand the factors that controlled climate change in the past, an
              understanding that is crucial if we are to interpret the climate changes of
              today.  For example, such an understanding is crucial if we are to separate
              "natural" climate variations from anthropogenically induced ones, and to
              predict future climate change.  In this project, the investigators will use
              Global Positioning System (GPS) data from regions previously covered by
              glaciers to measure the present-day crustal motions associated with postglacial
              rebound.  Using these data, a refined model for the history of the ice cover
              will be determined.  This refined history can be used to estimate parameters
              that govern the evolution of the climate.
