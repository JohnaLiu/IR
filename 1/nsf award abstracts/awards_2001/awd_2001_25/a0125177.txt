Abstract    :
              Numerical models of ocean dynamics will be used to address two key aspects of
              dense water formation and modification process on the antarctic continental
              shelves.  They pertain to: 1) the export of dense water from the shelf; and 2)
              its descent down the slope.  These studies are justified by new hypotheses on
              bottom water formation and seek to facilitate the parameterization of such
              processes in global climate models. 
This modeling study is closely related to
              a ship-based study that will investigate how the Antarctic Slope Front and
              continental slope morphology determine the exchanges of mass, heat, and fresh
              water between the shelf and the deep ocean, in particular those leading to
              outflows of dense water into intermediate and deep layers of the adjacent
              basins and into the world ocean circulation 
While the importance to the
              global ocean circulation and climate of cold water masses originating in the
              Antarctic is unquestioned, the processes by which these water masses enter the
              deep ocean circulation are not.  The primary goal of the experimental work is
              to identify the principal physical processes that govern the transfer of
              shelf-modified dense water into intermediate and deep layers of the adjacent
              deep ocean. At the same time, it seeks to understand the compensatory poleward
              flow of waters from the oceanic regime. This work will help to provide the
              dynamical framework for the observations and synthesize the observations into a
              coherent whole.
