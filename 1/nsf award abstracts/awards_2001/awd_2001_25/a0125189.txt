Abstract    :
              Fluids play an important role in the mechanics of earthquake generation.  As the
              pressure of subterranean fluids increase, the stress required to trigger an
              earthquake decreases.  Recent work along the San Andreas Fault indicates a
              fundamental paradox in that the apparent stress along the fault is
              insufficient, according to theory, to generate earthquakes.  One possible
              solution is that the fluid pressures are sufficiently high that the low stress
              that is present is still sufficient to trigger earthquakes.  The proposed work
              will model several sources and mechanisms for developing and maintaining
              elevated fluid pressures in the San Andreas Fault region.  The quantitative
              constraints provided by this research will aid in a more thorough understanding
              of factors which may relate to earthquakes in California and elsewhere in the
              world.
