An extensive data-reduction program for analysis of 40Ar/39Ar
              data is already in the beta testing phase at the Berkeley Geochronology Center
              (BGC) and other laboratories. Support from this grant add important, high-level
              data interpretation features, as well as producing detailed documentation
              suitable for public dissemination. These features will include: 1) an Arrhenius
              plotting program to evaluate argon diffusion experiments, 2) linkage of
              step-heating spectra directly to isochron analysis, so that the identification
              of a plateau can be based on isochron MSWD's, and also that non-zero intercepts
              can be fed back directly into the plateau program to generate appropriate
              plateau and integrated ages, 3) optional text-file input of spectrometer data
              in a standard format, and 4) data reduction capability for non-Ar Noble gasses.
              Expanded user support for this program will include a detailed,
              redundantly-indexed, PDF-format manual and on-line support in the form of help
              screens as well as Balloon Help on Mac OS systems up to 9.1, and Tool Tips on
              Mac OS X. As envisioned, the manual will be suitable as a web-available
              teaching tool for graduate-level classes in isotope geology.
