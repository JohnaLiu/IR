Abstract    :
              This project proposes to perform fundamental research on the development of
              classes of
distributed control laws and algorithms for optimal traffic
              engineering in a multiple-
service enabled Internet. Having its basis on
              recent results on the use of Sliding Mode
theory in the context of control of
              computer networks, the proposed research aims at
developing decentralized
              algorithms and tools for optimal traffic engineering in the
presence of both
              multiple paths and multiple classes of service. The theoretical
underpinnings
              of various traffic engineering algorithms will be developed. It will
              also
provide solutions, implementation guidelines to practitioners in the
              field and also
valuable input to standardization bodies on the effectiveness
              of various traffic
engineering approaches.
