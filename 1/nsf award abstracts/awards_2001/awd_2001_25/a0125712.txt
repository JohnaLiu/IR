Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

This proposal focuses on improvements in the Instrumental
              Analysis and Physical Chemistry laboratories, in the undergraduate research
              program, and in the enhancement of collaborative efforts across disciplines
              fostered by the acquisition of an LC-MS. Experiments are being adapted from the
              research and educational literature and implemented into the undergraduate
              curriculum. In the Instrumental Analysis laboratory, students are performing
              project-based, comprehensive investigations typical of those they will be
              expected to carry out once employed in an industrial setting. Each project
              involves real world problems, utilizes several instruments, includes a
              literature review, method development, and laboratory preparation, and requires
              2-4 weeks for completion. The LC-MS is playing a significant role in several of
              these projects. The instrument is also being used extensively in undergraduate
              research, both within the Department and in collaboration with faculty members
              outside the Department.
