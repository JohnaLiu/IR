Abstract    :
              The Huntington Library will develop the Rose Hills Foundation Conservatory for
              Botanical Science to engage visitors of all ages in the study of plants. 
              Conceived as a synthesis of a traditional conservatory and an interactive
              science center, the Conservatory will be a 16,000-square-foot permanent
              exhibition featuring spectacular plants in a family-oriented setting.  Using a
              living collection of plants from around the world, visitors will explore the
              diversity of plants.  Interactive exhibits will encourage visitors to make
              observations and comparisons of plant structures.
