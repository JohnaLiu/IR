On geologic time scales, atmospheric pCO2 is
              controlled by the release of Ca and Mg from silicate weathering and subsequent
              formation of Ca/Mg-carbonates in the ocean.  Attempts to deduce the past
              intensity of silicate weathering have relied mainly on the measured marine
              87Sr/86Sr, but lately also on the marine 187Os/188Os record.  In order to
              correlate 87Sr/86Sr and 187Os/188Os in continental runoff with relevant major
              cations released through silicate weathering, comprehensive data for 87Sr/86Sr,
              187Os/188Os, Re, Pt, and major cations (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Si) and anions (Cl, SO4,
              HCO3) in streams and rivers is needed.  Mafic silicates are generally more
              reactive in the surficial environment than felsic minerals and runoff from
              ultramafic rocks is characterized by high Ca/Na, Mg/Na and total dissolved
              loads.  Weathering of ultramafic rocks may thus be an important source of
              riverine Ca and Mg derived from silicate weathering.  As a comprehensive data
              set on ultramafic rock weathering is missing, this project aims to correct that
              by investigating, in the field and experimentally, how weathering of ultramafic
              rocks affects riverine, and thus ocean chemistry.
