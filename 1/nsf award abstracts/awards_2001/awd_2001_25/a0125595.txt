Abstract    :
              This is a four-year project to conduct seismological investigations of deep
              earth structure and earthquake sources.Using modern digital seismic waveform
              data, fundamental questions about dynamical structures in the mantle and
              rupture processes of large earthquakes will be addressed. The discovery of
              systematic variation of interplate earthquake rupture duration will be
              followed-up by detailed analysis of the source finiteness for very small thrust
              earthquakes on the megathrust fault in subduction zones. On average, these
              shallow events are found to take 2 to 3 times longer to rupture than comparable
              seismic moment events at larger depths. Establishing whether this is due to low
              stress drop or low rupture velocity requires determination of rupture
              dimensions, which will be pursued using directivity analysis with theoretical
              and empirical Green's functions. Studies of major boundary layer dynamics will
              also be conducted. Amplitude and arrival time anomalies for S waves from
              intermediate and deep focus earthquakes will be modeled by three-dimensional
              methods to help constrain the velocity structure and fate of deep slab
              downwellings. The effects of these downwellings on phase equilibria in the
              mantle will be examined using waveform-stacking methods that detect and
              characterize velocity and impedance contrasts in the mantle around subducting
              slabs. Complex velocity heterogeneity near the core-mantle boundary will be
              analyzed using new digital data sets and a hybrid 2D/3D wave propagation method
              that has recently been developed at UCSC.
