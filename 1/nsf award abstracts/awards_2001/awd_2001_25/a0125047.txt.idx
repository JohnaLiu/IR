Abstract    :
                   The investigator and his colleagues develop an interdisciplinary training
              program that would give graduate students substantive training in both
              mathematics and biology. The goal is to produce students competent in both
              disciplines, with genuine expertise in applied mathematics and some
              specific area of biology: biofluids, ecology and evolutionary
              biology, neuroscience, or physiology.  Training is built on the
              Special Interest Group, which includes faculty members from both mathematics
              and biology, students and postdocs, and industry-based researchers where
              appropriate.      Modern biology is increasingly mathematical
              and computational.  Education and training in components of both disciplines
              is needed to prepare people for the 21st century workforce, for leading-edge
              research, and for teaching.  This pilot project includes innovative aspects in
              its thematic organization, flexible arrangement of both common
              and area-specific content, interdisciplinary teaming, combination
              of theoretical and experimental training, and involvement of industrial
              partners.  The combination is promising for fostering long-term changes by
              growing a generation of scientists, mathematicians, and engineers who share
              language and skills well enough to take up and solve key problems.
