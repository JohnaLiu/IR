Global Position System (GPS) data can now be used to measure
              movements of Earth's surface with few-millimeter precision. Using GPS, research
              has recently revealed that the solid Earth changes shape due to seasonal change
              in the surface distribution of water, snow, and air pressure. This raises the
              possibility of using GPS with the Earth as a "weighing machine" to measure
              surface mass as it changes in time and place.

By applying a new inversion
              method, this project plans to use worldwide GPS data from the International GPS
              Service (from 1996 to 2004) to produce a movie of surface mass redistribution
              around the globe over an 8-year period, with 1-week resolution. This will be
              useful to investigators modeling the global water cycle, as it will provide
              seasonal to decadal change in the intensity and geographic pattern of seasonal
              variation in near-surface water (of all forms). Determining whether the global
              water cycle is intensifying is a central science question concerning global
              climate change. One likely consequence of an accelerating water cycle is change
              in the amplitude of seasonal cycling of water storage between Earth's
              reservoirs, which this project should help to quantify.

A secondary goal of
              this project is to test mechanical models of the Earth. Current models are
              largely based on seismology at much shorter time scales, and they ignore
              lateral variation in elasticity. To test these models requires independent
              information on surface loads, which this project will obtain from global
              atmospheric and hydrologic models, and sea level data, as well as data from
              remote sensing satellite missions.
