This award provides three years of funding to study the
              transition from slow inland flow to fast ice stream flow by making use of a
              suite of geophysical measurements that have been made near the onset region of
              ice stream D in West Antarctica.  These data provide a unique opportunity to
              develop and validate glaciological models of the controlling processes in ice
              stream onset zones.  Important processes to quantify are motion at the bed and
              deformation in the ice.  Previous analyses indicate that the controlling
              resistive forces shift from the bed to the sides during the transition from
              slow inland flow to fast, streaming flow.  Model sensitivity analyses will be
              used to investigate the relative importance of feedbacks between basal
              processes and ice deformation in the transition from inland to ice stream flow.
               Model experiments will determine what factors control the location of the
              onset of streaming flow, and how that location might migrate when conditions at
              the bed, or along the flow direction, changes over time.  The overall goal of
              this work is to improve understanding of the evolution of the WAIS drainage
              system.  This study is a first step towards understanding the physics that
              govern the transition from slow inland flow to fast streaming flow.
