Abstract    :
              The Lunar and Planetary Institute will expand a successful pilot program in
              which libraries in Texas and Louisiana are used as community learning centers. 
              The program is two-fold and includes both "Explore!" resource materials and
              "Fun with Science" modules.  "Explore!" materials are a collection of space
              science posters, brochures, fact sheets, videotapes and references.  These
              resources are disseminated to librarians for use as part of their collections
              and to support the "Fun with Science" modules.  "Fun with Science" consists of
              eight space science modules that librarians are trained to use in after-school
              and summer youth programs.  Module topics include rocketry, comets, impact
              cratering, remote sensing and space capsule design.  Each year, 3-4 new modules
              will be produced.  Librarians receive training on content, activities and NASA
              resources in 2-3 day sessions.  The dissemination plan would enable the program
              to expand to include public libraries in Texas, Illinois (Chicago) and South
              Carolina, as well as school libraries as a secondary audience.  Rural sites
              will be targeted and distance learning will be used for training when possible.
               CD ROMs containing the modules, training videos and a website will be
              developed to support this project.
