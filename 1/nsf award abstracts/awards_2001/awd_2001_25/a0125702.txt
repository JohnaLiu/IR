Abstract    :
              SoundPrint Media Center is producing a testing a pilot of a radio project that
              would examine mathematical models used to simulate phenomena, make predictions
              and generate scenarios.  During the "What If:  Models, Predications and
              Scenarios" pilot phase, SoundPrint will produce and test two half-hour
              documentaries, follow-up radio updates, and a plan for a web-based model
              simulation and educational resources.   Educational Support Services will
              conduct evaluation of the pilot materials to determine:  the programs' ability
              to translate complicated mathematical and scientific ideas through a
              storytelling approach, the types of models that best lend themselves to
              illustrate those concepts, and the degree to which the documentaries as stand
              alone stories have an impact on listeners.  The formative evaluation also will
              test a website.
