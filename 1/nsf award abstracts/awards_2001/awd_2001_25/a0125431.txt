Abstract    :
              This study will investigate how the Antarctic Slope Front and continental slope
              morphology determine the exchanges of mass, heat, and fresh water between the
              shelf and the deep ocean, in particular those leading to outflows of dense
              water into intermediate and deep layers of the adjacent basins and into the
              world ocean circulation 
While the importance to the global ocean circulation
              and climate of cold water masses originating in the Antarctic is unquestioned, 
              the processes by which these water masses enter the deep ocean circulation are
              not.  The primary goal of this work therefore is to identify the principal
              physical processes that govern the transfer of shelf-modified dense water into
              intermediate and deep layers of the adjacent deep ocean. At the same time, it
              seeks to understand the compensatory poleward flow of waters from the oceanic
              regime.  The upper continental slope has been identified as the critical
              gateway for the exchange of shelf and deep ocean waters.  Here the topography,
              velocity and density fields associated with the nearly ubiquitous front must
              strongly influence the advective and turbulent transfer of water properties
              between the shelf and oceanic regimes.  The study has four specific objectives:
              [1] Determine the mean frontal structure and the principal scales of
              variability, and estimate the role of the front on cross-slope exchanges and
              mixing of adjacent water masses;  [2] Determine the influence of slope
              topography and bathymetry on frontal location and outflow of dense Shelf Water;
               [3] Establish the role of frontal instabilities, benthic boundary layer
              transports, tides and other oscillatory processes on cross-slope advection and
              fluxes; and [4] Assess the effect of diapycnal mixing, lateral mixing
              identified through intrusions, and nonlinearities in the equation of state on
              the rate of descent and the fate of outflowing, near-freezing Shelf Water.
