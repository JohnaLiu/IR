Abstract    :
              Integrated paleomagnetic/geochronologic study necessitates radical tectonic
              re-thinking in the Boston portion of the Southeastern New England Avalon Zone
              because new isotopic data reveal fundamental flaws in the long accepted
              regional stratigraphy. For example:

1.	Reportedly Neoproterozoic, but
              previously undated Brighton volcanic interbeds from four geographically
              separated sections in the Roxbury Conglomerate have maximum ages of
              approximately 587 Ma, 490 Ma, 438 Ma and 362 Ma based on 1-4 grain zircon
              fractions.

2.	 Reportedly Ordovician Quincy Granite (based on an upper
              intercept date of 437 + 23 Ma) has yielded Siluro-Devonian zircons (single
              grain analyses with 207 Pb/ 206 Pb dates of approximately 410 Ma).

3.	
              Reportedly 630 + 15 Ma Dedham Granite west of the Boston Basin has yielded a
              weighted mean 207 Pb/ 206 Pb date of approximately 610 Ma based on three single
              zircon analyses.

Preliminary paleopoles based on these geochronological data
              further suggest that:

1.	The previously reported Neoproterozoic Avalonian
              pole form the Roxbury Conglomerate is from Silurian or younger
              rocks.

2.	Reliably dated Neoproterozoic rocks formed at low-mid latitudes
              rather than the previously reported high-mid latitude for the 610 to ~ 570 Ma
              interval.

This proposal seeks funding for continued work to clarify
              stratigraphic and structural relationships in
the Boston area as a basis for
              completing 5 or 6 well dated paleomagnetic poles. These poles will constrain
              revised interpretations of the paleolatitude of the Southeastern New England
              Avalon Zone during Neoproterozoic arc magmatism, its position during during
              hypothesized "snowball" earth climatic events and the timing of mid-Paleozoic
              accretion to North America. Oriented paleomagnetic cores will be collected at
              21 new locations in Avalonian arc rocks including Dedham Granite and Mattapan
              Volcanic Complex, in overlying Neoproterozoic strata including the Cambridge
              Argillite and glaciomarine deposits comprising the Squantum Member of the
              Roxbury Conglomerate, in "Brighton" Volcanics and in several other formations
              of uncertain or poorly constrained age (including reportedly Jurassic intrusive
              rocks of the Medford dike and Calf Island sill). Twelve of these sites are also
              targeted for supporting geochronology and ten for geochemistry.
