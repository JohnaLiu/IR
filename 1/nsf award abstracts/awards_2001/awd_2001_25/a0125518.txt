The investigators will undertake research to obtain the most
              accurate and geophysically rigorous determination of global sea-level change to
              date. To correct tide-gauge data for the effect of postglacial rebound, the
              investigators will use state-of-the art theory, Earth models, and observations.
              A new element of the proposed research will be the use of Global Positioning
              System (GPS) data to correct for vertical crustal motion. This study requires
              careful assessment of various GPS data sets that could potentially contribute
              to this study, because it is difficult to achieve the required level of
              accuracy in the vertical rate with GPS. Nevertheless, such accuracy, at least
              on a regional basis, is possible. A recent analysis of GPS and tide-gauge data
              from Scandinavia, for example, yields a regional value for Baltic sea-level
              rise of 2.1 +/- 0.3 mm/yr. The Baltic tide-gauge data set, although potentially
              a powerful contributor to studies of sea-level change, has never before been
              used in a global analysis due to its contamination by postglacial rebound. This
              research will enable quantification of the relative contributions to
              present-day sea level change of thermal expansion of the oceans and the ongoing
              melting of glaciers and ice sheets, knowledge that is crucial to our ability to
              understand the causes and the present state of climate change.
