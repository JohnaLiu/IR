Although the simple expression representing the
              solubility of water in magmas as a function of P,T and liquid composition, is
              adequate for many hydrous phase-equilibrium experiments, its extrapolation to
              iron-rich basalts and to higher pressures is problematic. Using our internally
              heated pressure vessel, it is proposed to measure the water solubility in two
              Columbia River basalts as a function of P & T to make secure the compositional
              extrapolation of the solubility algorithm to Fe-rich liquids of varying silica
              concentration. Published direct measurements of the volume of dissolved water
              in magmas will be included in the revised algorithm (a regressed variable in
              the early formulation) to ensure that the pressure dependence of the solubility
              relationship extrapolate to published high pressure
              experiments.

Hornblende-bearing intermediate lavas associated with
              subduction are always more oxidized than their hornblende-free associates. The
              reasons for this are unknown and could indirectly result from the expulsion of
              dissolved water on eruption in combination with a sulfur species. This will be
              tested by using a newly developed X-Ray fluorescence technique to measure the
              sulfur concentration in a large collection of sub-aerial crystalline lavas for
              which the redox state is well known.
