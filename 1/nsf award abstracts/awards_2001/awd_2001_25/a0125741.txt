Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to determine the slip rate of the San Andreas Fault at several
              sites in southern California using 10Be and 26Al measurements of the exposure
              ages of offset geomorphic surfaces. Determination of a millennial slip rate
              north of Los Angeles, on the flank of the Mojave Desert, would provide a
              critical constraint to the interpretation of geodetic data there. Rates of slip
              across the fault on each side of the San Gorgonio Pass stepover would constrain
              the relative importance of the several strands of the fault in that region.
              Within the complex restraining stepover, rates and dates of fault slip and
              folding would test a new model of transpressional deformation. They would do
              this by constraining the evolution of deformation there throughout the late
              Quaternary period. A quantitative understanding of active deformation would
              also provide a basis for forward models of future large earthquakes involving
              this ominously historically dormant section of the San Andreas Fault.
