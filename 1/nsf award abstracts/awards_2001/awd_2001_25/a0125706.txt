The focus of the two-year research project is to
              quantify the relative
importance of (a) the large-scale forcing fields of
              water vapor and
thermal buoyancy versus (b) the storm microphysics for the
              development
of the spatio-temporal characteristics of convective oceanic
              surface
rainfall variability.  Of particular interest is to understand
              the
effects of cold microphysical properties on rainfall variability
              at
various spatiotemporal domains and resolutions.  The research
              studies
oceanic rainfall as a first step toward the understanding of the
              causes
of rainfall variability by separating the large scale forcing
              and
microphysics from the complex terrain influences present in
              continental
rainfall.  The research results are of fundamental importance
              for
hydrometeorology and hydrology, and they may be used in applications
such
              as (a) downscaling or upscaling rainfall estimates obtained by
remote sensing
              or by large-scale climate models, or (b) hydrologic
design studies requiring
              rainfall estimates of high spatio-temporal
resolution.  Statistical-dynamical
              numerical models of rainfall genesis
and evolution are combined with data from
              national large-scale
experiments to achieve the goals of the project.  State
              equations for
the vertical momentum, mass and energy conservation are
              integrated
efficiently using typical vertical profiles of the state
              variables,
estimated from field experiments in convective regimes.  A number
              of
quantitative hypothesis are tested regarding the causes of
              rainfall
variability in domains of a 256-km length, with spatial resolution of
              1
km and temporal resolution of 1 min.  The models are used in a
Monte-Carlo
              framework that incorporates uncertainties in observed data,
large-scale
              forcing fields, and model microphysical parameterizations,
including possible
              feedbacks from the generated cloud to the near field
large-scale forcing.
