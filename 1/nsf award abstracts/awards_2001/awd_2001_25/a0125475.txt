This project will address the temporal development of
              aerobic capacity, lipid metabolism and oxygen stores in the skeletal muscles of
              young Weddell seals relative to aspects of the cellular environment that are
              important in the genetic regulation of myoglobin expression during maturation.
              The study will collaborate with ongoing investigations of the diving and
              hunting behavior of free-ranging adult and subadult Weddell Seals to
              investigate adaptations and the genetic control of the ontogeny of enzymatic,
              ultra-structural, and vascular adaptations for diving that occur in the
              skeletal muscles of adult Weddell seals. The first objective is to characterize
              the developmental changes in aerobic capacity, lipid metabolism, fiber type,
              and myoglobin concentration and distribution using enzymatic,
              immuno-histochemical and myoglobin assays in newborn, newly weaned, subadult
              and adult seals. The second objective is to determine the molecular controls
              for changes in the concentration and distribution of myoglobin in skeletal
              muscles during maturation. Molecular techniques will be used to determine the
              differences in mRNA populations in the swimming muscles of the different age
              classes of Weddell seals. These data will identify the proteins and
              transcription factors that influence the ontogenetic changes in myoglobin
              concentration. The results will increase our understanding of both the ontogeny
              and molecular mechanisms by which young seals acquire the physiological
              adaptations necessary to become competent divers and marine predators. In
              addition, this study will advance our knowledge of the molecular regulation of
              myoglobin in skeletal muscle, which has broader applications for human
              medicine.
