This project will develop and apply two seismological
              methods for improving estimates of the inner core's rate of rotation with
              respect to the rest of the solid Earth.  First, the investigators shall search
              for doublets in pertinent source regions, to enable very precise measurement of
              differential travel times that are indicative of inner core rotation. (A
              doublet, is a pair of earthquakes occurring at different times but in almost
              exactly the same location.  A differential travel time is the time between two
              signals on the same seismogram.) Second, they shall search for indications of
              travel time change in seismic waves that have traveled almost vertically in the
              Earth, from a seismic source (an earthquake, or a nuclear explosion) to its
              antipode.  By working with examples of seismic waves that have passed very
              deeply into the inner core, and are thus more sensitive to effects of
              anisotropy and inhomogeneity in the inner core, the investigators will be
              better able to understand the basic mechanism causing travel time changes.
