Abstract    :
              This award supports a detailed laboratory analysis of the mass-independent
              isotopic composition of processes associated with atmospheric nitrate trapped
              in the snow pack at the South Pole. The project will specifically test if the
              oxygen isotopes 16O, 17O, 18O of nitrate can be used to probe the
              denitrification of the Antarctic stratosphere.  Despite decades of research,
              there are several important issues in Antarctic atmospheric science, which are
              presently inadequately resolved. This includes quantification over time of the
              sources of nitrate aerosols. Today, little is known about the past
              denitrification of the stratosphere in high latitude regions. This lack of
              knowledge significantly limits our ability to understand the chemical state of
              ancient atmospheres and therefore evaluate present and past-coupled
              climate/atmosphere models. The role of nitrogen in environmental degradation is
              well known. This issue will also be addressed in this proposal.  Atmospheric
              aerosols have now been shown to possess a mass-independent oxygen isotopic
              content. The proposed research will investigate the stable oxygen isotope
              ratios of nitrate in Antarctica both collected in real time and from the snow.
              Two periods of time will be covered. Full year nitrate aerosol collections,
              with week resolution time horizons, will be performed at the South Pole. Weekly
              aerosol collections will help us to identify any seasonal trend of the
              oxygen-17 excess anomaly, and eventually link this anomaly to the
              denitrification of the Antarctic stratosphere. This data set will also be used
              to test our assumption that the oxygen isotopic anomaly of nitrate is mainly
              formed in the stratosphere and is well preserved in the snow pack. If true, we
              will for the first time resolve an atmospheric signal extracted from a nitrate
              profile. The snow pit will allow us to see any trend in the data on a multiple
              decade timescale.
