Mineral dissolution data obtained by vertical scanning
              interferometry have formed the basis for a new surface model of the dissolution
              process.  This model has been formalized in a fundamental rate law (Lasaga and
              Luttge, Science 291, 2400-2404, 2001), with potential relevance to a wide range
              of minerals and mineral surface problems.  In this project, we set forth a plan
              integrating experimental and theoretical techniques designed to explore the
              kinetics and dissolution mechanism of (alumino)silicates.  We also anticipate
              that this work will have far reaching implications for other minerals as well. 
              The techniques were chosen to enhance one another and provide complementary
              information, and include vertical scanning interferometry (VSI), hydrothermal
              atomic force microscopy (HAFM), Monte Carlo (MC) and solvated ab initio and
              density functional theory (DFT) quantum mechanical calculations.  This approach
              will also allow us to incorporate results with data taken from previous
              experiments involving mineral powders and single crystals in batch and flow
              reactors.  By operating over a wide range of length scales, this work has the
              potential to provide a much-needed, critical link between the atomic-scale
              observation of surface phenomena and their macroscopic result.  
The project
              will produce the following: (1) the dissolution rates of plagioclase as a
              function of solid composition, temperature and pH; (2) a direct comparison of
              VSI and HAFM data; (3) the relationship of these data to macroscopic (bulk)
              rates, as well as ab initio and DFT calculations; (4) the relationship between
              reaction rate and mineral surface area in terms of total (BET) versus reactive
              surface area; (5) a detailed understanding of the kinetics and mechanisms of
              feldspar dissolution from solvated ab initio and DFT calculations, and their
              relationship to earlier gas-phase calculations.
