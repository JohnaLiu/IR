Abstract    :
              Recent improvements in our understanding of the physics and rheology of fault
              slip suggest that predictive modeling of fault displacement may be possible in
              the near future.  Such models require observational constraints from both
              geodesy and seismology, and ideally the observations should encompass time
              scales greater than that of the earthquake cycle.  Working collaboratively with
              UNAM (National Autonomous University of Mexico), the University of Colorado is
              developing an integrated model of megathrust fault slip, using data from the
              state of Guerrero, Mexico.  The study area encompasses a ~100 km segment of the
              Cocos-North America plate boundary with more than 5 m of seismic slip deficit. 
              The geodetic data suggest that significant transient, aseismic slip recently
              occurred on the Guerrero subduction interface.  This poses a fundamental
              question: does the seismic slip deficit (or "seismic gap") in Guerrero
              represent a very mature accumulation of plate boundary strain?  Or, does the
              subduction megathrust in Guerrero relieve most of its strain accumulation
              aseismically? In other words, does transient motion in Guerrero translate to a
              higher seismic hazard, or a lower hazard, than on other megathrusts?  This
              question is being addressed via a combination of data collection and modeling. 
              The Guerrero gap is being monitored continuously with GPS receivers operated by
              CU and UNAM.  These GPS data are combined to estimate positions on a daily
              basis and are used as input to the models.  The GPS receivers are also being
              operated at higher rates, 5 Hz, so that higher rate positions can be estimated
              during earthquakes and combined with seismic data also being collected in
              Guerrero.
