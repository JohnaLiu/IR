Abstract    :
              The Garden Mosaics program will develop and test a model in which youth conduct
              research on community and home gardens in urban settings.  Youth ages 11-18
              will be recruited to participate in gardening activities in conjunction with
              elders from their communities.  Students learn the science content associated
              with organismal biology, community ecology, ecosystems and the physical
              environment, as well as culturally-related food growing practices. 
              Participants then take part in guided research; using methods such as transect
              walks, mapping, ecosystem models and soil tests, to document food-growing
              practices of immigrant minority and traditional gardeners.  Expanded research
              investigations will be open to students who want to continue their explorations
              using the Internet and other resources.  Students contribute to new and
              existing databases of ethnic and heritage gardening practices in the United
              States.  Materials to be developed include an Educator's Manual, a Youth
              Handbook and a Garden Mosaics website.  During the pilot phase a national
              leadership team will be established to test the program and materials at 10
              sites in different cities across the U.S. including San Antonio, Baltimore,
              Boston, Sacramento, New York, Brooklyn and Philadelphia. It is anticipated that
              the dissemination of this model will reach more than 750 educators and 13,000
              youth.
