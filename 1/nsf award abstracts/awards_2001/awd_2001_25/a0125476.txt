Abstract    :
              Tectonic models have focused on explaining how orogenic belts initiate and
              develop in terms of plate interactions, but the related problem of how
              orogenies end has received relatively little attention. This project will
              address this issue by a detailed study of the circumstances of the ending of
              the Taconic orogeny in New England, and will involve extensive radiometric age
              dating. These and extensive existing geological data for this area will be
              utilized in testing several models of how orogeny terminates. Results are
              expected to applicable to the general problem.
