Abstract    :
              Many mountain belts are characterized by late stage normal faults and bimodal
              igneous activity, both considered to be reflective of orogenic collapse. This
              proposal will address a classic example of such activity, the Donegal granitic
              suite of northern Ireland by collecting a suite of very high quality
              radiometric ages on igneous rocks and fabric-forming minerals in shear zones
              believed to related to plutonism. The ages of plutonic rocks coupled with ages
              of activity on major shear zones will provide critical data needed to evaluate
              various mechanisms which produced the late stage activity.
