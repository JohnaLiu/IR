Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)
The power and versatility of modern NMR spectroscopy make it an
              essential tool for chemists. The Department of Chemistry is adapting a variety
              of experiments from the research and educational literature that uses nuclear
              spin to obtain structural information and implementing them as discovery-based
              experiments. These experiments are providing the context for introducing NMR
              techniques in a sequence that gradually increases the difficulty of relating
              molecular structure to spectral information.

Organic chemistry students are
              being introduced to NMR early in the first semester through C-13, DEPT, and
              HETCOR experiments, followed by the characterization an organofluorine
              compound, using 2-D NMR to identify an unknown ester, probing the
              stereospecificity of a reduction reaction using NOE, and investigating the
              conformational dynamics of DEET. Students in Organic Spectroscopy are
              characterizing non-trivial unknowns using a variety of complementary
              spectroscopic techniques. Students in advanced courses are investigating
              phosphorus-phosphorus coupling and characterizing structures of enzyme
              inhibitors, among other laboratory projects. These discovery-based experiments
              require a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer with multinuclear capability
              and possessing the resolution and flexibility required by such experiments.
              Research in a variety of areas has become an integral part of the training of
              our undergraduate students and the high-field NMR is finding numerous
              applications.
