Abstract    :
              National Video Resources, in collaboration with the American Library Association
              and the History of Science Society, is developing and implementing six-week
              discussion programs at 100 libraries across the country.   The "Research
              Revolution and the Shaping of Modern Life" discussions will illuminate the
              organization and goals of scientific-technical work, the critical outcomes of
              research and development, the material and social byproducts of such work, and
              the ethical issues that sometimes result.  During the program participants will
              screen and discuss documentary films on topics such as: an introduction to the
              rise of organized laboratory research and its results; new developments in
              quantum technologies and nanotechnology; recent developments in materials
              science and how artificially created materials have defined a modern way of
              life; the impact of genetic engineering and the Human Genome Project; medical
              imaging from x-rays to MRIs and CT-scans; and the science of meteorology and
              the problems of global climate change.  Discussions will be lead by local
              scholars from Universities and research laboratories located near a
              participating library.
