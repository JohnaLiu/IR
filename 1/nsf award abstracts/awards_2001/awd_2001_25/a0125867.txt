The primary
              objective of this proposal is to document the petrological characteristics and
              tectonic significance of high- to ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism (HP-UHPM) of
              Pan-African nappes in Minas Gerais State, southeast Brazil. The crystalline
              nappes are components of the Tocantins orogen, which extends along strike for
              around 1000 km, and records Neoproterozoic convergence, subduction and
              collision between the Sao Francisco craton and Rio de la Plata plate.
              Techniques to be applied will include: [1] X-ray compositional mapping of major
              and trace elements in garnets, [2] identification of inclusion species in
              garnet and zircon by micro-Raman spectroscopy, [3] textural and compositional
              characterization of exsolution lamellae and integration of precursor phase
              compositions, [4] SHRIMP U-Pb geochronology of zircon zonal domains. These
              studies will be complemented by conventional analyses of reaction textures and
              petrofabrics. The observation of coesite-grade metamorphism in the Americas not
              only impacts local studies of the Brasiliano-Pan African tectonic framework,
              but also provides a comparison between deep burial in the Proterozoic (at c.
              630 Ma) and better studied Cainozoic orogenic analogues.  This proposal, which
              addresses directly ancient convergent margin orogenesis, provides critical
              detail field, geochemical, and geochronological data of deeply buried rocks now
              exposed at the surface.  The newly derived P-T-time data for this 630 Ma
              terrane will be incorporated into regional geodynamic models for the evolution
              of the South American orogen.
