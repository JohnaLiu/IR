Occupation History and Diet of Adelie Penguins in the
              Ross Sea Region

This project will build on previous studies to investigate
              the occupation history and diet of Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) in the
              Ross Sea region, Antarctica, with excavations of abandoned and active penguin
              colonies. Numerous active and abandoned colonies exist on the Victoria Land
              coast, from Cape Adare to Marble Point will be sampled. Some of these sites
              have been radiocarbon-dated and indicate a long occupation history for Adelie
              penguins extending to 13,000 years before present (B. P.). The material
              recovered from excavations, as demonstrated from previous investigations, will
              include penguin bones, tissue, and eggshell fragments as well as abundant
              remains of prey (fish bones, otoliths, squid beaks) preserved in ornithogenic
              (formed from bird guano) soils. These organic remains will be quantified and
              subjected to radiocarbon analyses to obtain a colonization history of penguins
              in this region. Identification of prey remains in the sediments will allow
              assessment of penguin diet. Other data (ancient DNA) from these sites will be
              analyzed through collaboration with New Zealand scientists. Past climatic
              conditions will be interpreted from published ice-core and marine-sediment
              records. These data will be used to test the hypothesis that Adelie penguins
              respond to climate change, past and present, in a predictable manner. In
              addition, the hypothesis that Adelie penguins alter their diet in accordance
              with climate, sea-ice conditions, and other marine environmental variables
              along a latitudinal gradient will be tested. Graduate and undergraduate
              students will be involved in this project and a project Web site will be
              developed to report results and maintain educational interaction between the PI
              and students at local middle and high schools in Wilmington, NC.
