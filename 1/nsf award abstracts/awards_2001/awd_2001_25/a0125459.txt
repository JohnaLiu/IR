The PI proposes to convene a symposium at
              Scripps Institute of Oceanography in theoretical and computational seismology. 
              As discussed in detail in the proposal, the conference is being held to bring
              together experts in theoretical seismology to address the explosion of
              observational data sets in seismology and what is necessary to keep parallel
              advances in theory/computation.  The issues being addressed are central to
              understanding Earth dynanics, and will be crucial for the optimization of the
              MRE-funded USAffay component of Earthscope.  Funds will be used to offset
              travel and accommodation expenses for participants (especially students and
              post docs) and to pay for publication costs of a symposium volume.  The Pls
              requested $18,000 in support, but I asked for a revised budget and have agreed
              to provide funds at the level of $15,000
