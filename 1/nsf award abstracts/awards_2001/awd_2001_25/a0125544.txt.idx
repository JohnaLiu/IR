Abstract    :
              AST 0125544 Lazarian  This research program is aimed at understanding the
              generation and evolution of astrophysical magnetic fields. Magnetic fields play
              decisive role in many astrophysical processes from mediating star formation and
              transporting angular momentum in ubiquitous accretion disks to influencing
              heating/cooling within clusters of galaxies. In all these situations, the large
              magnetic Reynolds numbers of the flows require that any changes of magnetic
              field topology be implemented through fast reconnection, while magnetic field
              generation requires fast dynamo.  The project makes use of recent advances in
              numerical capabilities to test recently advanced theories of fast reconnection
              and fast dynamos. It also proposes further development of reconnection theory,
              comparisons of theoretical and numerical results with liquid sodium
              measurements, and simulations of the galactic dynamo. Another very important
              outcome of this effort will be the development of a parallel AMR MI-ID code,
              RIEMANN, for simulating MHD phenomena in rotating astrophysical systems. This
              will be a general-purpose utility that will be made widely available to the
              community. Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for
              Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC). ***
