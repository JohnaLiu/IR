This project continues work begun under Award No.
              9950551.

The project is developing, evaluating, and disseminating
              educational devices, software, and curriculum materials that center on the
              nature of light, optics, color, and perception. The major innovation of the
              project is the introduction of "homelabs" about light into college science
              courses. These inquiry-based, quantitative laboratory experiences are designed
              for students to perform in their own homes. Many of these activities take
              advantage of the unique properties of computers, allowing students to use
              inexpensive optical materials to manipulate, explore, and study the light
              coming from their monitors. In the Project LITE "proof-of-concept" phase
              (funded through NSF Award No. 9950551), the investigators conducted the initial
              development and testing of a number of these homelabs.

The basic educational
              goal of the homelabs is to encourage individualized hands-on (and "eyes-on")
              learning. The use of homelabs also seeks to alleviate a major resource problem
              faced by many large, introductory-level, non-majors university science courses,
              arising from the limited availability of laboratory space, equipment, and
              teaching assistants.

Project LITE materials are being developed and tested
              at Boston University. The national impact of individual homelabs is being
              extended by integrating them into community college, university, and high
              school courses in astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth science, physics, and
              psychology, as well as into science courses for pre-service teachers. The
              homelabs are also useful for distance education, home learning, and adult
              continuing education.
