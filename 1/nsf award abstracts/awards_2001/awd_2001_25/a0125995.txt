                              The Tibetan Plateau deforms over time much more than any other
              large piece of continental crust on earth.  Unlike most tectonically active
              regions, the effects of plate motion there are not localized to a narrow
              boundary separating India and Asia, but are spread across thousands of
              kilometers, from the Himalayan foothills to Mongolia.  Where this deformation
              occurs within the Plateau is still mostly unknown, as are the basic physical
              mechanisms driving it.  The work supported by this funding intends to attack
              both of these mysteries by improving mathematical models of crustal deformation
              to include edge and surface effects hypothesized for the Himalayan boundary,
              and by making direct measurements of the velocities of remote parts of Tibet
              using GPS geodesy.  Existing models of Tibetan dynamics have not yet addressed
              the development of the shape of the Himalayan arc.  Existing maps of observed
              Tibetan surface velocities are still mostly blank.  It is currently impossible
              to differentiate among competing hypotheses of how Tibet grows and moves based
              on predictions of surface motions or of geographic shapes.
