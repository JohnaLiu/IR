              ABSTRACT

OCE-0125313

The study will  use a series of aircraft flights out
              onto Artic ice fields in the SBI work areas during March and April of years
              2003 and 2004 to obtain hydrographic, nutrient and other chemical tracer
              distributions representative of end-winter - early spring conditions of the
              underlying water column. These late winter samples will be used to complement
              additional Shelf Basin Initiative (SBI) cruise hydrography in this region.
              Hydrography (temperature, salinity, density) will be profiled from the ice
              surface to 250m or the sea floor depending on water depth. Additional samples
              will be taken for nutrients, d 18O and possibly dissolved inorganic carbon
              parameters. The study areas will include transects out from Point Barrow
              (Alaska) to 1650 W, a transect across the shelf-slope break at 1540 W, and a
              transect across the shelf break at 1510 W, along the location of a current
              meter mooring line which is deployed as part of the larger SBI experiment.
