This award supports a project to construct an isotopic record
              of atmospheric methane and nitrous oxide over the last century from South Pole
              firn air.  Over the last 150 years, atmospheric methane and nitrous oxide
              concentrations have risen in response to increased emissions from various
              anthropogenic activities.  As this trend is liable to continue in the
              foreseeable future, it is important to understand the biogeochemical processes
              that contribute to the emissions of these two greenhouse gases.  In this
              context, records of the variations in the atmospheric loading of trace gases
              found in ice cores and interstitial spaces in the snow near the surface of the
              ice sheet (firn air) provide fundamental boundary conditions for reconstructing
              historical emission records.  One way to improve our understanding of the
              cycling of bioactive trace gases and their emission records is to use stable
              isotope tracers, which have been recorded in the ice cores and firn air.  This
              project will develop records of carbon-13 and deuterium isotope ratios of
              methane, as well as the nitrogen-15, oxygen-18 and the isotopomer composition
              of nitrous oxide trapped in firn air samples collected in January 2001 at the
              South Pole.  These measurements will allow isotopic records of these
              atmospheric gases to be reconstructed throughout the 20th century.  Such
              records will help to establish the relative contribution of individual sources
              with a higher degree of confidence than is currently available.
