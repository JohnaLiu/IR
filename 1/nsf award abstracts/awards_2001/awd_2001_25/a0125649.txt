Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21). This project is creating materials presenting the
              structure of the hydrogen atom and the periodic table as a first example of the
              power of representation theory in predicting physical phenomena from
              information about symmetries. Despite the centrality of representation theory
              to modern mathematics, mathematical physics and physical chemistry,
              undergraduate courses in representation theory often ignore the physical
              applications. During this proof-of-concept project materials are being tested
              at a number of different institutions, and a modular approach is being
              incorporated into the materials development so as to broaden the appeal of the
              materials to an audience that includes disciplines outside of mathematics . A
              book on representation theory is planned and an arrangement is already in place
              with a leading publisher.
