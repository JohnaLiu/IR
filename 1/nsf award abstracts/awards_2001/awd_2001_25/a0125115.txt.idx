Abstract    :
              The WWMeB meeting will bring together biologists and software developers who are
              working to develop a World Wide Meiosis Database.  Meiosis is the process by
              which egg and sperm cells are generated, the gametes.  Two previous meetings
              have been held.  At this meeting, the organizerrs will incorporate two new
              gender-specific databases that have been developed for describing events in the
              development of eggs and sperm, respectively.  The meeting will produce a plan
              for coordinating international efforts in an area of biology where the general
              processes have been highly conserved.
