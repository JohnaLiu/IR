Abstract    :
              This project is a three-year laboratory study involving the reactions of ozone
              with alkenes and the reactions of peroxy radicals with nitrogen oxide in the
              lower troposphere.  This study is focused on identifying and characterizing the
              role of short-lived intermediates (Criegee intermediates) in these reactions. 
              The P.I. is in the process of building a system of flow reactors with infrared
              and ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy to carry out the study.  This project is
              expected to contribute to a better understanding of atmospheric oxidation
              mechanisms leading to the formation to tropospheric ozone.
