Abstract    :
              The proposal plans to connect DePaul to Abilene via the MREN GigaPoP. The
              connection would allow the School of Computer Science, Telecommunications and
              Information Systems to fully participate in Internet2 research projects.  These
              projects have specialized needs including access to specialized network
              facilities, access to high bandwiths, access to collaborators on the high-speed
              national network.
