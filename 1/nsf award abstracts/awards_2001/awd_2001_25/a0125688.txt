Abstract    :
              The current rate of strain concentrated along the Altyn Tagh and Kunlun fault
              systems in northern Tibet is being determined using the technique of radar
              interferometry. These fault systems play a key role in the dynamics of the
              continental deformation in Asia, yet their slip rate and associated deformation
              are still poorly known. Currently debated issues include the respective amounts
              of the convergence between India and Asia that are absorbed by crustal
              thickening and by lateral extrusion of continental blocks, or the
              characterization of the distribution of deformation throughout the continent.
              These issues are unresolved because of the poor knowledge of the present-day
              kinematics in the collision zone. In addition, northern Tibet has been the
              locus of two large earthquakes in 1997 and 2001 producing a disruption in the
              current inter-seismic strain pattern in the northern part of the collision
              zone.

Spatially continuous maps of the line of sight displacement of the
              ground along active fault zones are being constructed by interferometric
              processing of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. This research exploits the
              extensive archive of ERS SAR data covering the northern Tibet area that have
              been acquired by the European Space Agency since 1992. Errors in the data due
              to poor orbit determination and troposphere phase propagation delay are reduced
              using a baseline re-estimation procedure and data averaging, following the
              approach developed with radar data of California. Line of sight displacement
              maps are then combined to constrain deformation process models of long-term
              fault creep and of co-seismic slip and post-seismic relaxation for the 1997 and
              2001 events. The data are used to determine distribution of inter-seismic
              strain in the vicinity of the Kunlun and Altyn Tagh faults, far-field slip-rate
              associated with the faults and variation of rates along the length of the
              faults, surface displacement associated with the 1997 and 2001 earthquakes,
              possible linkage between these two events, influence of post-seismic processes
              on the strain accumulation in other sections of the fault. Slip rates are being
              compared with long-term rates inferred from geological observations.
