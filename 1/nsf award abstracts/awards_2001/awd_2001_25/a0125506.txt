Viscosity of hydrous silicate melts plays a critical role
              in bubble growth, magma fragmentation and volcanic eruptions.  This proposal
              requests funding to develop a new and long-term project for viscosity
              measurement using a novel technique developed over the years in my lab.  It is
              based on the equivalence between glass transition temperature and the apparent
              equilibrium temperature of the hydrous species reaction in silicate melt.  In
              order to obtain viscosity using this method, the equilibrium of the hydrous
              species reaction must also be characterized.  Such data are important in their
              own right in understanding melt structure, water solubility and diffusion in
              magma, and D/H fractionation between water vapor and melt.  In the three years
              of the grant period, we will concentrate on the following: a) speciation and
              viscosity at high pressures for hydrous rhyolitic melt up to 8 GPa; b)
              speciation equilibrium in hydrous dacitic melts and the viscosity of such melts
              to high dissolved H2O content (up to 8 wt% dissolved H2O); and c) development
              of more accurate viscosity models for hydrous rhyolitic and dacitic melts.  The
              new viscosity model will be applied to re-evaluate previous results of bubble
              growth and magma fragmentation.
