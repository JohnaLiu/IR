Abstract    :
              Sumners 0125000      The investigator and his colleagues in the  Program
              in Mathematics and Molecular Biology (PMMB) organize an international
              conference on the subject of multiscale phenomena at the interface of the
              biological and mathematical sciences. This meeting includes a broadly
              multidisciplinary set of participants, students and researchers active at the
              interface between mathematics (broadly defined) and biology.  This
              project supports the participation of approximately 15 domestic students and
              young scientists, selected from a national pool of applicants generated by web
              and journal advertisements for the meeting.  An unusual feature of the meeting
              is an opening day of tutorials, which prepare the attendees for the lectures,
              with mathematical scientists introducing basic principles to biologists
              and biologists giving tutorials for the quantitative scientists. 
              Two sessions focus on issues of importance to students working at
              the interface between the computational sciences and biology. Students are
              especially welcome to attend the meeting and present posters on their work.  
                 The Program in Mathematics and Molecular Biology (PMMB) conducts research
              at the interface between molecular biology and the mathematical sciences and
              trains students and postdocs in this area.  An essential part of this effort
              is a series of conferences on mathematics and molecular biology.  The
              meetings provide a comfortable but challenging environment where students and
              scientists from each discipline can learn about the other discipline and about
              multidisciplinary approaches to the solution of important problems in modern
              biology.  This fosters interdisciplinary training, catalyzes new
              interdisciplinary collaborations, and in an important scientific area helps
              develop more people with both mathematics and biology expertise.  The project
              supports students and junior scientists.
