Abstract    :
              Physics (13) This project is modernizing the introductory physics laboratory
              using computerized instructional technology. Microcomputer Based Laboratory
              (MBL) tools that use the RealTime Physics (RTP) program designed by David
              Sokoloff and Ronald Thornton are being adapted. Students in their first and
              second year of college and also high school physics instructors and students
              are participating in the project. The objective is that the student play an
              active rather than passive role in performing the experiments which include
              data acquisition, analysis (graphs and calculus) and intuitive inference.
              Immediate visual display of the experimental results saves time and enhances
              students' laboratory skills and their ability to retain the physical concepts
              learned. The implementation of the RTP also allows development of more
              appropriate laboratory exercises for students with different science majors.
              The
standardized Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation is being used to
              evaluate the effectiveness of the methods. An external peer reviewer familiar
              with education policies in Puerto Rico is also evaluating progress. To better
              prepare students who may come to the university while still in high school, a
              summer workshop is being organized for local high school science instructors to
              assist them in learning new and powerful ways of teaching basic science. Videos
              tapes showing high school students immersed in physics related experiments are
              being distributed to local high schools in order to make studying physics more
              attractive as a career option.
