The primary goal of this proposal is to confirm the discovery of
              mass-independent sulfur isotope fractionation by replicate analyses to validate
              accuracy and to identify mineral hosts of anomalous sulfur and measure its
              heterogeneity. The motivation for additional study of sulfur isotope analyses
              is because of their utility as biomarkers in ancient rocks. In Precambrian
              rocks where fossils are non-existent and organic residues have been converted
              to carbon, sulfur isotope mass-dependent fractionations remain as an indelible
              record of the vital processes of sulfate-reducing microbes. With the discovery
              of mass-independent sulfur isotope fractionations in Archean rocks, sulfur
              isotope geochemistry has acquired even greater significance. Such
              fractionations are known in the upper atmosphere where gas phase reactions take
              place under the strong influence of ultraviolet light. Sulfur isotope analyses,
              therefore, may give evidence for the former existence of life but they may also
              record a previously unknown chapter in the evolution of Earth's atmosphere.
              This proposal will examine the distribution of anomalous sulfur geographically
              in Archean and Proterozoic metamorphic rocks. Stratigraphic sections will be
              measured to establish a sulfur isotope fractionation time distribution. The new
              sulfur isotope laser fluorination microprobe at the Geophysical Laboratory of
              the Carnegie Institution will be used to do detailed examination of Archean and
              Proterozoic metamorphic rocks.
