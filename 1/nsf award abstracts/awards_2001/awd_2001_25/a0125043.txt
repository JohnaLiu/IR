Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funding for an advanced network connection, in part, to
              facilitate research and education in the areas of immersive technology
              development, community-building with collaborative spaces using common wall
              technology, development of technologies for cluster-based computing in support
              of the Applications Service Provider (ASP) model of computing, development of
              middleware technology for advanced networking.
