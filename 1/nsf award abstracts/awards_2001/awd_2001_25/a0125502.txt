Abstract    :
              The Paleocene-Eocene epoch boundary at 55.5 million years before present
              coincides with the sudden onset of an 85,000-year greenhouse event of transient
              climate change, the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum or PETM, that involved
              release of massive amounts of light carbon into the atmosphere from shallow
              marine methane reservoirs.  The resulting negative carbon isotope excursion
              [CIE] was first recognized in the deep sea, and then on land in the northern
              Bighorn Basin, Wyoming.  In the Bighorn Basin the CIE coincides with a "Wa-0"
              faunal immigration event including the first appearance of modern orders of
              mammals such as Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla, and Primates in North America,
              and with an abrupt but short-lived diminution in size of some mammalian
              lineages.  Research here involves high resolution biostratigraphic
              investigation of continental mammals in the PETM interval.  A 50-m-thick
              stratigraphic section containing the CIE and Wa-0 mammalian fauna is being
              studied around the margin of the Bighorn and Clarks Fork basins.  Specific
              objectives include measurement of stratigraphic sections documenting marker
              beds and lateral facies changes in this interval; mapping of distinctive marker
              beds tying sections together using differential GPS with meter-scale precision;
              location of known fossils relative to measured and mapped bed units; location
              of productive new lithologies; quantification of body size change in all
              lineages crossing the Wa-0 interval; preparation and description of previously
              collected and new specimens of Wa-0 mammals focusing on the newly-discovered
              Meniscotherium priscum interval at the base of Wa-0; and collection of
              additional faunal specimens (gar scales, Coryphodon teeth, etc.) of known bed
              level for high resolution study of oxygen isotopes and paleotemperature through
              the continental CIE/Wa-0 interval.  The overall objective is better
              understanding of biotic response to short-term climate change.
