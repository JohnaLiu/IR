This proposal aims to advance the accuracy and application of
              scaled analogue models of caldera formation. Until recently, experimental
              models have struggled to accurately reproduce the caldera forming process.
              While new models illustrate that the collapse process is starting to be
              understood, they do not address the complexities that are inherent in real
              calderas. We have already developed a basic experimental setup which
              investigated the effects of varying the magma chamber depth, pre-existing
              topography, magma chamber pressure, and cross-sectional symmetry. The crust is
              scaled as sand in these and earlier experiments. Due to compaction effects, the
              sand appears to deform in a time-dependent fashion. Therefore, our improvements
              to this basic model will include: (1) scaling the rheological variability of
              the wallrocks and the magma chamber by using a sill-like, water-filled chamber
              contained within a silicone jacket; (2) measuring the pressure fluctuations
              within the chamber; (3) varying the timescales of eruption (chamber evacuation)
              relative to tectonic and intrusion processes; and (4) gradually adding material
              to the surface of the collapsing block so as to model emplacement of
              intracaldera ignimbrites. Experimental calderas that are produced purely from
              the collapse of a homogeneous subsiding block may have limited application to
              the complex structural relationships observed at actual calderas. This proposal
              will model four structural elements that are critical to the caldera-forming
              process but are poorly understood: 1) precursory tumescence; 2) pre-existing
              faults; 3) extension and transtension; 4) resurgence.
