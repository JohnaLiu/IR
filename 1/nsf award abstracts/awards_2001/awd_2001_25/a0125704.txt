Abstract    :
              This project focuses on new approaches to maximizing power consumption in
              handheld and other wireless devices by combining a network-centric view of the
              power-consumption issue (aximizing longevity for the network rather than device
              by devic)  with the more traditional device-centric view (power management
              capabilities for the individual device).  The project will model and evaluate
              new architectures and algorithms that allow the operating system to accept
              input from the applications and interact closely with the network for
              minimizing overall energy in the wireless system. The focus of the research is:
               

1)    power-management of individual nodes 
2)   power-aware routing, in
              the sense that the power is minimized for the overall network and not only for
              individual messages or streams. 
3)   a combination of the variable voltage
              scheduling with the power-aware routing. 

It is anticipated that through
              algorithm development and analysis, simulation and testbed implementations, the
              results of this project will lead to a better understanding of how to provide
              more efficient power management to nodes with rechargeable batteries, and how
              to integrate CPU and network power management under one paradigm.
