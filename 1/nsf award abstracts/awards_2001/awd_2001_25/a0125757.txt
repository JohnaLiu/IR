Abstract    :
              The Lawrence Hall of Science at the University of California at Berkeley will
              develop the "Real Astronomy Experience (RAE)" in which science center visitors
              will explore the universe by controlling and viewing robotic telescopes via the
              Internet; by using image processing software to understand the images they
              capture; and by capturing images with a hands-on, functional telescope equipped
              with a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera to learn how a modern telescope
              image-capture system works.  Guided by project materials, visitors learn about
              the cosmos, tools and methods of scientific research, data analysis and the
              general progress of modern astrophysics.
