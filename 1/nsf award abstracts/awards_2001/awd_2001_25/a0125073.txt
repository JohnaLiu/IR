Abstract    :
              
Many animals experience parts of the environment to which we are not privy. 
              Bats use echolocation, some insects sense substrate vibrations.  We recently
              found that a fish, the pygmy swordtail, communicates in the ultraviolet (UV)-- 
              light to which our skin but not ours eyes are sensitive. 

Male swordtails
              have a sword that extends beyond the tail fin.  Our previous studies, which
              inadvertently excluded UV, were never able to show that females preferred males
              with swords to those without swords.  Recently we discovered that the sword
              reflects UV, and that when tested under light containing UV (e.g. sunlight)
              females do indeed prefer males with swords.  Thus UV plays a critical role in
              the communication system involved in mate choice.  We also found that the
              swordtail's major predator, the Mexican tetra, does not see in the UV.  Thus
              males can increase their conspicuousness to females but not predators by adding
              UV reflectance to the sword.

In the proposed study we will determine how
              general the UV communication system is in these types of fishes, if variation
              in the presence of UV influence when the animal's court, how sensitive the
              visual system is to UV, if the presence of UV does not influence the predator's
              hunting success, and if the swordtails use UV for other tasks, such as locating
              their own prey.  These studies promise to give us insights into a sensory world
              of these animals that was previously unknown.
