This award supports Anatoly Klypin and students from New Mexico
              State University in a collaboration with Stefan Gottloeber of the Astrophysical
              Institute in Potsdam, Germany.  The project will focus on expanded computer
              modeling of the formation of galaxies and other large objects in the expanding
              universe.  Specifically, the research will investigate the nature of dark
              matter, which defines the process of formation of such objects as well as their
              structure.  Both sides of the collaboration bring specific and complementary
              expertise, skills, and resources to bear on the problem.  The US side will
              provide computer codes for running and analysis of simulations, while the
              German side will develop new methods of analysis in order to study the results
              of the modeling.  The project will also compare model results with actual
              observed data.  The work plan provides for extensive participation by graduate
              students in the international travel and research.
