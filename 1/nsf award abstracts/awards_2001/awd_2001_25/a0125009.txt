Abstract    :
              Hipparions are an extinct group of three-toed horses that flourished widely in
              the Old world shortly after their first occurrence there in the late Miocene,
              at about 11 Ma.  Once established, hipparions evolved into a multitude of
              lineages with chronologic ranges extending to the middle Pleistocene in China
              and the late Pleistocene of Africa.  The paleobiology of these horses within
              this great temporal (ca 10 m.y.) and geographic span has not been addressed
              systematically heretofore. PIs believe that hipparions actually originated
              within the North American genus Cormohipparion, but the actual species involved
              has not been demonstrated.  Their proposed research will break new ground in 1.
              describing a complex pattern of speciation within Cormohipparion; 2. better
              resolving the Old World hipparion immigration and subsequent evolutionary
              radiation; and 3. unraveling the origin, evolutionary radiation, multiple
              geographic extensions and adaptation of species belonging to a distinctive Old
              World late Miocene Pleistocene radiation known as the Sivalhippus Complex. 
              Once having described and documented the pattern of dispersal and
              diversification of hipparions in the Old World PIs will be able to investigate
              the paleobiology of these horses to gain further insights on the dietary and
              locomotory adaptations by which they achieved their predominance in this
              evolutionary theater for so long an interval of time.
