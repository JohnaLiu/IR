Abstract    :
              The process of rifting of continents to produce oceanic lithosphere is a first
              order phenomenon on Earth. Unfortunately, most rifted margins are buried by
              thick accumulations of sedimentary rock, hindering direct observation of the
              structures which formed during rifting. This project will address several
              significant questions about oblique rifting with a multi-disciplinary study of
              the Salton Trough in southern California. This region is undergoing active
              extension and right-lateral strike-slip faulting related to opening of the Gulf
              of California and the San Andreas fault. Exposures of bedrock are excellent and
              there is an opportunity to examine a plate margin caught in the process of
              forming. A combination of geological, sedimentological, geophysical, and
              geochronological methods will be brought to bear to study the partitioning of
              strain between strike-slip and normal faults and the accompanying
              sedimnetological response to each.
