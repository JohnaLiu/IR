Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99)

By integrating computer ethics across the curriculum,
              this project addresses the following 
concerns: 1) the increased use of
              instructional technology in the classroom; 2) the growth 
of enrollment in
              online distance education programs; 3) the need to improve the knowledge 
of
              ethical, social and legal issues in computing of women and underrepresented
              minorities; 
and 4) the limited ties between technology and other disciplines.
              The workplan is to: 
1) develop modules that are interdisciplinary in design
              and that capitalize on the life 
experiences of Mercy students for all the
              general education courses offered at the College; 
2) develop modules
              addressing the specific issues of online distance learning courses; 
3) lead
              workshops on designing ethics modules for all courses for the Mercy faculty on
              a 
faculty seminar day; 4) design and conducting an online workshop for
              faculty at other 
colleges and universities; and 5) develop a new course for
              computer information science 
majors. These curriculum enhancements are
              designed to: 1) increase the diversity of 
students who are knowledgeable
              about computer ethics and the related social and legal
issues so the rewards
              of technology can be reaped by all in an equitable manner, and 
2) emphasize
              oral, written and critical thinking competencies while focusing on the
              
interdisciplinary connections of computer ethics.

In order to accomplish
              this work, we are adapting a range of materials previously developed and made
              available to the community via NSF support. These materials include a range of
              case studies in computer ethics and the social aspects of computing.

This
              course includes an online team-taught module with a faculty member of DePaul
              
University and student-student collaborative projects from the two
              institutions.
