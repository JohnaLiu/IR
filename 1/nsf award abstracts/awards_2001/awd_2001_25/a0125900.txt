This award supports a project to improve the understanding of
              the biogeochemical processes that control CH4 emissions.  Records of the
              concentration of methane in trapped gases in ice tell us about changes in
              atmospheric loading through time.  Such records do not, however, provide
              information on the individual sources or sinks.  One way to refine our
              understanding of the cycling of bioactive trace gases like methane is to use
              stable isotope records of trapped gases in ice cores.  This project will
              measure the Deuterium/Hydrogen (D/H) ratio of methane trapped in shallow/recent
              ice (covering the last ~ 200 years) at Siple Dome, Antarctica.  The proposed
              work will complement current efforts to measure the carbon-13 isotope ratio of
              methane in ice cores and will provide fundamental information on the various
              sources and sinks of atmospheric methane over the last 200 years.
