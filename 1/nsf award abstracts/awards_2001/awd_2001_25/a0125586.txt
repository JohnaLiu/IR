Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21) This project is adapting and implementing the WeBWork
              homework "delivery" and grading system to help improve the success of students
              in College Algebra. The project builds on the successful use of WeBWorK to
              increase homework activity of students in calculus classes in several
              institutions. This project is now extending the use of the system to a large
              service class, College Algebra, with a total enrollment of 720 students each
              academic year at the PI's institution. The collection of problem sets created
              using the PG (problem generator) programming language developed for WeBWorK is
              being shared with other WeBWorK authors for distribution. In addition, training
              workshops are being conducted for an average of eight faculty per semester who
              are using WeBWorK directly in College Algebra classes. During the final year of
              the project, faculty from area high schools, community colleges and other
              institutions of higher education are to take part in training sessions with
              WeBWorK and to share information about its effectiveness.
