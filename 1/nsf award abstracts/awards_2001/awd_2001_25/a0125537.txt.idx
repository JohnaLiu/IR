Abstract    :
              Hodgins 0125537  This award supports American participation in the first
              Asia-Pacific Advanced Studies Institute.  The meeting will take place in Tokyo
              from July 20-29, 2001 on the subject of "New Frontiers in Intelligent
              Robotics."  The general purpose of this meeting, and of those that hopefully
              will follow, is to bring young, promising researchers from around the Pacific
              together with their senior mentors and colleagues to discuss a leading area of
              scientific research.  It is hoped that by meeting for an extended period of
              time the participants will be able to engage in in-depth discussions and that
              they will form lasting professional ties.  The objective for the younger
              American participants is to provide them with a significant international
              experience in their field that will encourage them to think globally about
              their research careers.
