Abstract    :
              The proposal plans to connect UCHSC to Abilene via the Front Range GigaPoP to
              support NIH funded research requiring a high performance network connection. 
              This research includes the next generation of the Visible Human Project as well
              as research in the Center for Computational Pharmacology.
