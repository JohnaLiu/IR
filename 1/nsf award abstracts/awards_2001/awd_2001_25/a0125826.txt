The PIs propose to hold a Gordon Research
              Conference on Rock Deformation from May 19-24, 2002 at the Gordon Conference
              site in Barga, Italy.  As discussed in detail in the proposal, the conference
              is being held to bring together an interdisciplinary group of experts to
              discuss major unanswered questions about the deformation and plastic flow in
              the Earth's crust. The issues being addressed are central to understanding
              tectonic processes, the initiation of earthquakes, and the origin of natural
              resources.  Funds will be used to cover travel and accommodations to enhance
              participation of student and early career scientists.  It is expected that a
              broad and interdisciplinary cross-section of researchers from academia,
              government labs, and the broad international community will participate in the
              conference.  The PIs requested $25,000 in support, but the group of reviewing
              program directors decided that $20,000 is more appropriate for the conference
              as proposed.
