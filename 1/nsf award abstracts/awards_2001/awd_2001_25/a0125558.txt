Abstract    :
              Engineering - Chemical (53)
The major focus of our work is to explore and
              evaluate means of incorporating web-operable remote experiments as an
              educational tool in lecture courses. As a test vehicle for our ideas, we have
              created a remote experiment that provides an introduction to combustion, and
              the concepts of conservation of mass and energy. The experiment is used in an
              introductory chemical engineering course as a means of teaching adiabatic flame
              temperature. We have also introduced extensive report writing and more advanced
              engineering topics in conjunction with this experiment. Remote experiments have
              become more technologically straightforward and economically viable with the
              worldwide web. However, their educational value depends not only on a
              well-designed technology but more importantly on the content of the experiment.
              We are disseminating our results at the annual meetings of the American
              Institute of Chemical Engineers and the American Society for Engineering
              Education. A paper is being presented to Chemical Engineering Education
              journal.
