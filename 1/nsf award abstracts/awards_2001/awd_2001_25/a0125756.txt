This proposal will use the distribution of
              detrital zircon grains in stream systems surrounding the Snake River
              Plain-Yellowstone hotspot system to establish confidence limits on the use of
              detrital zircons as a fingerprint of provenance in fluvial systems.  
In the
              northern Rocky Mountains the Yellowstone-Snake River Plain hotspot and its
              associated topographic bulge have migrated northeastward from the late Miocene
              (17 Ma) to the present.  During this time, the western continental divide of
              North America has followed the crest of the migrating topographic bulge.  Thus,
              regional drainage, which in middle Miocene time was to the east from a
              continental divide in central Idaho, was disrupted to radial north- and
              south-flowing streams draining away from the topographic bulge.  Following
              passage of the hot spot and subsidence of the Snake River Plain in its wake,
              the west-flowing Snake River has progressively captured segments of several
              streams, causing them to flow west, rather than north, south, or east.  The
              migrating hotspot model makes testable predictions about Miocene to Recent
              drainage capture.  
This project will test the utility of the detrital zircon
              provenance method to accurately record drainage basin provenance.  PI will use
              SHRIMP (Sensitive High-Resolution Ion Microprobe) U-Pb geochronologic analyses
              of 60 grains each, from about 50 samples from modern streams and Neogene
              terrestrial sediments from the northern Rocky Mountains. He will investigate
              the size threshold of fluvial systems where mixing begins to mask distinctive
              zircon signatures.
