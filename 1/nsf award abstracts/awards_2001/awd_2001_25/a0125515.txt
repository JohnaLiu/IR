Abstract    :
              The goal of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project is to
              investigate the potential performance of fixtures utilizing Light Assisted
              Adhesive Gripper (LAAG) pad technology; and, to characterize the design factors
              that are critical to its feasible implementation.  In particular, this
              investigation will:  (1) carry out machining tests to verify the dynamic load
              capacity of a LAAG pad; (2) carryout a dynamic response comparison between a
              dedicated fixture-workpiece system utilizing conventional technology versus one
              utilizing LAAG pad technology; (3) determine the necessary optical qualities of
              the light transmission system, and generate and test a practical design; and,
              (4) carry out laser release experiments in order to determine the impact of
              laser switching frequency, laser wavelength, laser power, and adhesive
              thickness on workpiece release time.

In particular, the successful
              development of LAAG pad technology could lead to the following benefits:  (1)
              The total exposed volume of fixturing necessary to restrain a workpiece will be
              significantly decreased, while simultaneously the dynamic stiffness of the
              fixture-workpiece system will be significantly increased.  (2) Workpiece
              degradation due to pre-load deformation and contact surface brinelling and
              scratching will be eliminated.
