Abstract    :
              The Tibetan Plateau deforms over time much more than any other large piece of
              continental crust on earth.  Unlike most tectonically active regions, the
              effects of plate motion there are not localized to a narrow boundary separating
              India and Asia, but are spread across thousands of kilometers, from the
              Himalayan foothills to Mongolia.  Where this deformation occurs within the
              Plateau is still mostly unknown, as are the basic physical mechanisms driving
              it.  The work supported by this funding intends to attack both of these
              mysteries by improving mathematical models of crustal deformation to include
              edge and surface effects hypothesized for the Himalayan boundary, and by making
              direct measurements of the velocities of remote parts of Tibet using GPS
              geodesy.  Existing models of Tibetan dynamics have not yet addressed the
              development of the shape of the Himalayan arc.  Existing maps of observed
              Tibetan surface velocities are still mostly blank.  It is currently impossible
              to differentiate among competing hypotheses of how Tibet grows and moves based
              on predictions of surface motions or of geographic shapes.
