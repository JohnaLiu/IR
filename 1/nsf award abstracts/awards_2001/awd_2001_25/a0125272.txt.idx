Abstract    :
              0125272	 Schroeder			  This award is to the University of Alaska-Anchorage to
              support the activity described below for 36 months.  The proposal was submitted
              in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF
              0179).  Partners The partners for this activity include the University of
              Alaska-Anchorage (Lead Institution), University of Alaska-Fairbanks, University
              of Hawaii-Manoa, University of Washington, Ford Motor Company, Jet Propulsion
              Laboratory, The Boeing Company, Kimberly Clark, Alcoa, IBM Kirkland-Washington,
              Bureau of Reclamation, Microsoft, Flour Daniel, Alaska Technical Center,
              Northwest Arctic Borough School District, White Swan High School, Confederate
              Bands and Tribes of the Yakama Nation, NANA/DOWL Engineers, and NANA/Colt
              Engineers.  Proposed Activities The effort will bring computer technology to
              remote communities, provide high school students with a vision of a career in
              science and engineering, connect students with professionals in industry and
              academia, provide industrial partners with a technologically trained workforce,
              and develop the enabling infrastructure necessary to sustain the effort
              long-term.  Proposed Innovation The academic institutions will establish a
              modern computer laboratory with space, utilities, and Internet access in a
              remote rural community in each state in the partnership.  High school juniors
              and seniors in a college-ready high school curriculum will be targeted.  These
              students will be given state-of-the-art hardware and software training. 
              Students will have summer internships with partner companies where they will be
              paid cash as well as scholarship money with any of the partner universities. 
              The students will attend a summer bridging program the summer after graduation
              from high school to prepare them for college.   The industry partners provide
              $500,000 annually for the bridging program.  Potential Economic Impact The
              program will provide hundreds of high school students with access to
              technology-based education and jobs.  These students are from sparsely
              populated rural states, and most are Indigenous Americans.  The economic
              benefits result from a highly skilled workforce for the industry
              partners.  Potential Societal Impact The targeted students are Indigenous
              Americans from rural Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington.  The program can be
              replicated for any region with an indigenous population.  More than 300
              students have "graduated" from the internship program in the past.  The current
              award will provide needed resources to attract more students, provide more
              computer facilities, and interact with more industrial partners.
