Abstract    :
              The researcher would conduct studies of the educational attainment of Asian
              Americans of different generations from existing longitudinal data bases of
              high school and college students.  School performance includes the outcome of
              science, mathematics, English, and social studies learning. The intent of the
              study is to help understand whether and how Asian immigrants and their
              succeeding generations achieve educational mobility in particular to help
              identify factors that contribute to the differential outcomes of science and
              mathematics learning among different generations.  The study should help inform
              policies regarding the role of public education institutions in providing
              education for new Americans.  This project will produce papers that will be
              published in academic literature and distributed to government agencies.  It
              will be of interest to the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and
              Pacific Islanders.
