Abstract    :
              Interactive computer simulations are increasingly being used to teach
              students
scientific principles, but relatively little systematic research has
              done on
the factors that make a simulation pedagogically effective.  This
              research
explores  how to design a computer simulation so that students learn
              the
scientific principle underlying it, and transfer this principle to
              new
domains.  Principles from the interdisciplinary science of complex
              adaptive
systems are chosen because these mathematical formalisms are
              applicable across
a wide range of domains.  Laboratory experiments with
              students will explore how
active exploration of one simulation benefits or
              hinders understanding of a
subsequently presented simulation based on the same
              principle.  Experiments
will explore the roles of concreteness and
              idealization, simulation similarity,
and individual differences in abstract
              transfer.  The scientific goal of the
inquiry is to gain an understanding of
              how perceptual experience can lead to
abstract conceptual understanding, and
              how conceptual understanding can change
perceptual experience.  The practical
              goal is to translate this understanding
into general educational principles
              for integrating computer simulations into
classroom activities.
