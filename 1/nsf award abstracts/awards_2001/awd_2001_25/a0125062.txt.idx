Abstract    :
              The 2001 International Conference on Solid-State Sensors and Actuators
              represents an important opportunity to capture a perspective on the current
              state of the art in microstructure fabrication and the development of
              MicroElectroMechanical Systems. The 11th International Conference on
              Solid-State Sensors and Actuators (Transducers '01) will be held in
              Munich, Germany, from June 10-14, 2001. Transducers is a biennial conference
              focusing on theory, design, fabrication, and application of solid-state
              sensors, actuators, and microsystems. It is an interdisciplinary
              gathering with participants from university, government, and industrial
              laboratories representing diverse cross spectrum of fields: electrical
              engineering, mechanical engineering, materials science, biomedical
              engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, and microelectronics. We propose to
              partially sponsor travel for student authors of papers from North America to
              this conference. These student authors have been selected from a very
              competitive pool of abstract submissions, and represent the most talented
              young members of the MEMS community. These students will travel to the
              conference to present their own work, and then spend the remainder of the week
              attending presentations and discussions, gathering information on the most
              important breakthrough technologies revealed at the conference. Much of the
              fabrication and integration technology is of direct relevance to technologies
              and applications funded through NSF Electronics and Controls Systems office.
              Each of these students will write a brief report describing the important
              technologies they learned about at the conference, and these will be gathered
              into a summary report to NSF highlighting new trends in this community,
              important thrusts initiated by other countries, and areas where the US
              technological base holds advantages or disadvantages. The funding that we
              request will allow partial travel support for approximately 12 student authors
              from various institutions in North America.
