This award supports the continued measurements of gas
              isotopes in the Vostok ice core, from Antarctica.  One objective is to identify
              the phasing of carbon dioxide variations and temperature variations, which may
              place constraints on hypothesized cause and effect relationships. 
              Identification of phasing has in the past been hampered by the large and
              uncertain age difference between the gases trapped in air bubbles and the
              surrounding ice.  This work will circumvent this issue by employing an
              indicator of temperature in the gas phase.  It is argued that 40Ar/39Ar behaves
              as a qualitative indicator of temperature, via an indirect relationship between
              temperature, accumulation rate, firn thickness, and gravitational fractionation
              of the gas isotopes.  The proposed research will make nitrogen and argon
              isotope measurements on ~ 200 samples of ice covering Termination II (130,000
              yr B.P.) and Termination IV (340,000 yr BP).  The broader impacts may include a
              better understanding of the role of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations
              in climate change.
