Abstract    :
              The contributions of ionosondes as standard observatory network instruments are
              already widely recognized in aeronomy and its current focus on space weather.
              Modern digital research ionosondes such as the dynasonde expand the variety,
              resolution and dynamic range of the products, but also of the noise. This
              'noise' is, in fact, evidence of the very essence of space weather in the upper
              atmosphere: It is a signature of the irregular and dynamic state of the region.
              In this project, some theoretical developments that have already demonstrated
              substantial successes of this kind are to be extended and applied to dynasonde
              digital ionosonde measurements. Three new products include:

1) Statistical
              parameters to quantify the prevailing small-scale ionospheric irregularities,
              such as the amplitude and the index of a power-law spatial spectrum usually
              applicable in the range of scales extending from about the radio wavelength to
              at least the radio Fresnel scale.

2) An outer scale of the small-scale
              irregularities, when this can be distinguished from still larger irregularities
              attributable to Atmospheric Gravity Waves (AGWs).

3) Local spatial diversity
              of these quantities, using the 'all-sky' view characteristic of ionosondes.
              This can be very important especially in equatorial and auroral regions, during
              conditions of intense large-scale structuring. 

The PIs will use data from a
              dynasonde operating at EISCAT's auroral location; from another at the
              mid-latitude Bear Lake Observatory operated by Utah State University; and from
              an equatorial campaign, 'Project CONDOR' of March 1983 for the above studies.
