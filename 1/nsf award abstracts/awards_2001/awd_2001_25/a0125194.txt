This award, provided by the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics
              Program of the Office of Polar Programs, provides funds for research to
              establish the systematics of cosmogenic argon production necessary to establish
              its measurement as a routine surface exposure dating tool analogous to existing
              methods based on 3He, 10Be, 14C, 21Ne, and 26Al. Cosmogenic argon offers
              advantages over existing cosmogenic chronometers in that it is stable (hence
              applicable to long-term or ancient exposure dating) and less prone to diffusive
              loss than He or Ne. Production of 38Ar is principally by spallation of Ca and
              (probably) K, and is most easily measured using neutron-irradiated samples as
              has been performed routinely on extraterrestrial samples for several decades.
              Initial measurements on Antarctic samples by the principal investigators
              demonstrate the viability of this method for terrestrial samples, and suggest
              an average production rate >100 atoms/gm-Ca/year. Existing data suggest that
              38Ar/Ca exposure ages younger than 10^5 years may be determined by this method
              with useful accuracy. Further work on calcic minerals (apatite, sphene,
              clinopyroxene, plagioclase, calcite) whose exposure histories are constrained
              by 3He and 21Ne concentration data, will be used to determine the Ca-derived
              production rate. Analogous work on K-rich minerals (K-feldspars, micas) will be
              used to constrain the production of 38Ar from K, which should theoretically be
              comparable to that from Ca, using the same neutron-activation method. The
              analytical work will use existing samples plus new samples to be collected from
              the Dry Valleys of Antarctica in order to maximize cosmic radiation dosage for
              calibration purposes. Laboratory studies of 38Ar retentivity in appropriate
              minerals will be used to help evaluate our results and guide future
              applications. The results of this work will be important to a wide array of
              investigations that require knowledge of surface exposure ages.
