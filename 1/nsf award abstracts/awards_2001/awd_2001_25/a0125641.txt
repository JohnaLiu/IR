Abstract    :
              The ZOOM children's television series, which reaches over 5.4 million children
              each week, teaches viewers the scientific processes as well as delivering
              science and mathematics content.  The outreach materials and activities provide
              viewers with opportunities to explore, experiment and share their creativity. 
              WGBH is requesting $1,303,776 of a total budget of $3,977,936 to produce 20 new
              shows for the ZOOM series.  There also will be a new ZOOM campaign, the ZOOMsci
              Club, which will provide a unique way for kids to deepen their science and math
              knowledge while engaged in ZOOM's hands-on activities.  The campaign includes: 
              the new television programs, new print materials and outreach activities, and a
              new area of the ZOOM website that includes an on-line forum for kids to share
              results of their experimentation. 

ZOOM has been chosen by PBS as the first
              children's "local/national" show.  This PBS initiative capitalizes on the
              strength of local public television stations and provides the opportunity for
              stations to customize ZOOM to serve the needs of their local markets.  The
              stations can produce and insert segments that honor local kids for their
              volunteer activities and feature local kids answering questions.  Stations also
              can localize outreach activities, producing their own local ZOOM websites and
              launching ZOOM Into Action campaigns to motivate kids to volunteer.
