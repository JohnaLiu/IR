Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to make a fundamental contribution towards a
              nationally shared understanding of the role and impact of a science center in
              facilitating enhanced public understanding, attitudes and behaviors toward
              science by means of informal learning activities.  To accomplish this, this
              research project will investigate the following questions:  1) What are the
              specific long-term changes in science understanding, attitudes and behaviors
              that result from visiting a science center exhibition?  2) What are the factors
              that contribute to these long-term changes?  3) What is the relationship
              between science center visits and subsequent reinforcing educational
              experiences?  This study will build on previous work conducted by ILI at the
              California Science Center aimed at understanding how a science center impacts
              its community.  These studies are known collectively as the Los Angeles Science
              Education Research Project (LASER).  A sample of participants in one of the
              LASER studies has expressed their willingness to participate in subsequent
              interviews.  These interviews will be designed to capture both small and large
              changes in science understanding, attitudes, behaviors and other informal
              learning experiences subsequent to the visit to the science center.
