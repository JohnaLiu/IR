Abstract    :
              This award establishes a Nanoscience and Engineering Center (NSEC) for
              Integrated Nanopatterning and Detection Technologiesat the Northwestern
              University.  The Center will develop state-of-the-art nanopattering
              capabilities that are compatible with soft materials and can be used for the
              development of powerful new detection systems.  Several emerging patterning
              tools and synthetic methods will be developed to fabricate nanostructured
              materials and devices.  The Center's research strategy focuses on (1) the
              science and technology of surface template-driven assemblies that rely on
              chemical and biochemical recognition events, and (b) the experimental and
              theoretical study of signal transduction in soft matter nanostructures.  The
              research program is organized under three themes:  (1) Chemical and Biological
              recognition; (2) Nanostructured Assembly; (3) Transport and Transduction in
              Nanostructures Formed via Surface-Directed Assembly.  As the research
              progresses, focus will be placed upon the development of biological (nuicleic
              acids and proteins) and chemical (small molecule) sensors.  The research
              outreach will include University of Chicago, University of Illinois,
              Urbana-Champaign, Harold Washington University, and Argonne National
              Laboratory.  The Center will establish formal programs with international
              comp[anies, universities, and laboratories in the area of nanoscale research. 
              The Center will take a lead to establish the first global network of centers
              and institutes in the area of nanoscience and engineering.  In the area of
              undergraduate education, the Center will establish Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) and the Minority Internships in Nanotechnology (MIN)
              programs.  The MIN program will be promoted through the minority institutions
              in the area.  Middle and high school teachers will be provided research
              experience through Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program.  A web-based
              highly flexible "Functional Nanostructure" module will be developed and
              distributed.  New courses in nanotechnology will be developed for undergraduate
              and graduate levels.  Industry participates in the Center activities by
              providing company personnel as student mentors, and by supplying source codes
              for software development.  The Center has a program to advice on formation of
              startup companies.
