Abstract    :
              This project focuses on characterizing the water-insoluble component of
              size-segregated atmospheric aerosols. This can be a significant fraction of the
              aerosol and consists primarily of carbonaceous material or minerals (dust). The
              insoluble fraction could affect human health, can influence the
              hygroscopic/cloud nucleating properties of the aerosol, and can deposit on
              leaves and thus decrease the amount of radiation available to the plants for
              photosynthesis and thus crop production. A novel technique will be developed to
              measure the number concentration of the insoluble aerosol in real time. In
              addition, aerosol samples will be collected on micro-orifice impactors, the
              filters rinsed, and the mass of the insoluble component determined for each
              size fraction. The trace metal composition of the insoluble fraction will be
              measured, and the elemental and organic carbon fractions (EC/OC) quantified.
              Field measurement data will be used to study the impact of insoluble aerosol on
              plant photosynthesis due to the scattering and absorption of solar radiation by
              insoluble aerosols deposited onto leaves.
