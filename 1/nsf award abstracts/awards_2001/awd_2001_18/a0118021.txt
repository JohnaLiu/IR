Abstract    :
              The project provides for continued operation of the CHILL radar as a national
              facility.   The radar allows cutting edge research into convective storm
              initiation and evolution and will enhance scientific understanding of storm
              microphysics.  The proposed cooperative agreement specifies the management,
              staffing, testing, operation, technical upgrades and educational and outreach
              activities for the proposed 5 year period.  

The project is an
              interdisciplinary activity between the Departments of Atmospheric Science and
              Engineering, and it serves the broad research community as a primary radar
              remote sensing facility.  The combination of engineering and atmospheric
              sciences gives faculty and students the opportunity to explore technical and
              scientific topics in radar meteorology.  In research projects CHILL also
              provides high quality, real-time dual doppler information to coordinate the
              flight of a storm penetration aircraft in and around convective
              storms.

Enhanced use of the Internet allows real time access of data from
              any institution and faculty and students can operate the CHILL from remote
              locations.  The project provide far-reaching educational opportunities.
