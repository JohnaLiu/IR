Abstract    :
              Six to seven speakers each have been invited from the United States of America,
              Argentina and Brazil to cover topics on exploration of microbial diversity,
              uses of biodiversity, plant-microbe interactions and genomics. The aim of this
              workshop is to explore the possibilities of interaction between North and South
              scientific groups of Brazil, Argentina and the United States in the fields of
              microbial diversity and biocomplexity. The primary goals of the meeting consist
              of exploring and using microbial diversity for biotechnological purposes;
              starting studies of biocomplexity beginning at the level of interactions
              between microorganisms and other biological, physical, and chemical systems and
              proposing possible joint projects. This meeting promotes the participation of
              not only senior  investigators, but also graduate students and postdoctoral
              fellows from Argentina and Brazil. This award provides funds to cover roundtrip
              airfare costs from the USA to Buenos Aires, the site of the workshop, for the
              seven participants from the United States. The final program, conclusions and
              recommendations will be forwarded to the NSF and distributed to the
              participants.
