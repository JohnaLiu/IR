              Abstract of Tivey 0118445

The proposed project will study the Kane
              megamullion, which is interpreted to be the exhumed footwall of a long-lived
              normal detachment fault near the Kane Fracture Zone on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
              The faulting appears to have exposed a deep-crustal and possibly upper mantle,
              section of lithosphere, making it accessible to survey, sampling and eventual
              drilling.  The proposed field program will use the autonomous underwater
              vehicle (ABE), ROV Jason and dredging, together with laboratory analyses to
              address the questions of 1) how are magnetization and polarity -reversal
              history of Earth's magnetic field recorded at mid-crustal and deeper levels?,
              2) what conditions of magmatism at the rift axis attend formation of
              megamullions,and what are the resulting composition and intrusive relations at
              mid-crustal and deeper levels? and 3) what are the nature of strain
              accomodation and evolution of strain localization in the shear zone of a major
              normal fault in ocean crust?  This is a uniquely accessible section where
              survey and sampling will allow significant new insights into the processes of
              accretion and dissection of slow-spreading crust.  The survey data will provide
              data to extend and constrain interpretations from drilling into megamullions,
              into three dimensions.
