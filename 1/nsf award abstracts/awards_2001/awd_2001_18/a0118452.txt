This award supports travel of eight US participants to the
              2001 Conference of the Social Studies Education Consortium (SSEC) at Oxford
              University in the United Kingdom, June 30 -July 7, 2001 and their participation
              in pre- and post-conference project development workshops. The organizers are
              Joseph P. Stoltman and James E. Davis of Western Michigan University and Ashley
              Kent of the London Institute of Education and Andrew Convey of the University
              of Sheffield. The objective of the project is to engage "newly established" US
              and European scientist/researchers in international research collaboration on
              instruction in and learning of geography and science in the middle and
              secondary school years (grades 7 - 12).  Participants will discuss specific
              research foci in pre- and post-conference workshop devoted to development of a
              research agenda and writing of proposals. Established scholars and researchers
              will serve as mentors and reviewers of the research proposals and designs.  In
              addition each US participant will receive funds to initiate an international
              collaborative project.

Among the topics proposed for collaborative research
              in geography/science education are: differential performance between boys and
              girls; relationship between collaboration among teachers within schools and
              student performance; action agendas to promote instructional opportunities;
              comparison of integrated science approaches in teaching with other curricular
              and instruction approaches; and effects of parental participation in learning.
              The workshop will enhance understanding of European instruction in geography at
              comparable grade levels and take advantage of European advances and
              achievements in this area.
