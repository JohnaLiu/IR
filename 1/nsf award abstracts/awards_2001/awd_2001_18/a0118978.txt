Abstract    :
              
The 40th IEEE Decision and Control Conference (CD01) is the premiere, annual
              international conference on systems and automatic control research. It is
              sponsored by the IEEE Control Systems Society and conducted in cooperation with
              the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and the Institute For
              Operations Research and the Management Sciences. This year it will be held at
              the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress in Orlando Florida, December 4-7, 2001.
              Pre-conference workshops will be held on Monday December 3, 2001. The
              Conference provides an excellent opportunity for researchers to present the
              latest developments in the field, promote new ideas, and discuss and evaluate
              past accomplishments. The technical content of the Conference has traditionally
              been of the highest quality drawing leading scientific researches from all over
              the world. The Conference typically draws some one thousand participants each
              year. Such a venue is of special importance for the training of new researchers
              and graduate students in systems and control. The National Science Foundation
              has consistently supported these activities over the years by providing partial
              travel support for graduate students participating in the Conference. In this
              proposal we are asking that NFS continue this long-standing tradition and
              provide travel support for graduate students who will be participating in the
              2001 IEEE CDC.
