This twelve-month award will provide support for15 US
              students and junior researchers to participate in the first multidisciplinary
              summer school on "High Pressure Phenomena" held at the Enrico Fermi
              International School of Physics in Varenna, Italy, from July 3-13, 2001.  The
              course spans fundamental physics and chemistry, earth and planetary science,
              materials science and technology, and biology.  The PI will co-direct this
              school with Guido Chiarotti of the International School for Advanced Studies in
              Trieste, Italy. The course is largely financed by the Enrico Fermi school, the
              Italian Society of Physics (SIF), Italy's National Research Council (CNR), and
              UNESCO.   At least 80 participants - students, observers, and lecturers - are
              expected to attend. The course offers opportunities for graduate students and
              post-doctoral fellows to learn many fundamental concepts applications of
              high-pressure research.  It provides as well the opportunity to develop further
              international research experiences or collaborations in these fields.
