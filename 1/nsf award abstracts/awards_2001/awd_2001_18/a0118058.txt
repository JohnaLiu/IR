This award will provide funds for a
              Chapman Conference on Exploration Geodynamics.
Chapman Conferences are topical
              meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and are designed to
              promote opportunities not normally available through the format of larger
              meetings.  Funds will be used to support participant travel expenses.  Travel
              grants will be made on a competitive and need basis.  The convenors expect to
              issue approximately 12 awards at an average of $1,000 per award. 

The
              conveners of the conference seek to bring together an international cross
              section of the geodynamics modeling community, with the likely industry
              beneficiaries of "exploration geodynamics" in mineral and petroleum
              exploration.  The targeted audience will be leading practitioners of geodynamic
              modeling, exploration managers and scientists from exploration divisions of
              leading resource companies, and, to catalyze the interaction, consultants and
              academics who have been instrumental in bringing basic science through to
              industry.  Graduate students will be strongly encouraged to attend through a
              reduced registration fee and preferential access to travel grants.
