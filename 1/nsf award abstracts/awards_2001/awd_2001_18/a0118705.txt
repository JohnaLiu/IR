It is proposed to investigate the
              design feasibility of an intelligent drug delivery system.  Its design would be
              based on nanometer components organized into mass, surface and chemistry
              distributions which will optimize the delivery, while adapting to the nature of
              its body environment.  Such would be the delivery of insulin with a synthetic
              carrier nanodevice, which would typically protect the insulin load from
              gastrointestinal acidity, and also have an adaptive chemical distribution which
              will release the contained insulin when the carrier would reach a part of the
              flow showing predetermined ambient chemical properties.
