              Abstract

The PIs propose to collect records of 1870S/1880s and more limited
              8180 from DSDP sites
522 and 574 plus an on-land site in the Italian Appenines
              across the late Eocene-
Oligocene boundary to confirm their preliminary data
              that show a dip and then a dramatic
increase in 1870S/I 880s across the
              boundary. This boundary also marks the beginning of
the deterioration
              (cooling) in global climate after the long Eocene warm period. The cause of
              this cooling is presently undetermined and controversial with many possible
              causes. This research could help narrow the causes because the Os record will
              be compared with 6180 record of ice volume at site 522. In addition, the
              on-land section will be used to compare the Os record with an independent He
              proxy for interplanetary dust particle (IDP) flux that is capable of lowering
              global ocean 1170S/I "Os. The new study will establish whether the excursion Of
              1170S/1110s is a global event or not, and will help to narrow the possibilities
              for its cause. It will also develop the possible potential of Os isotopes as a
              proxy for continental weathering.
