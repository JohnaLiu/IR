One of the major needs in particle manufacturing is the separation
              of fine particles into a narrow size distribution.  This is particularly
              important in manufacturing of nanoscale particles where separation becomes very
              difficult and inefficient.  Regular gas-particle separation techniques will not
              work when the particles are very small because of the small ratio of particle
              inertia to drag.  The idea proposed in this project is to increase this ratio
              and, therefore, significantly increase the efficiency of the fine particle
              separation by decreasing the pressure in the separation chamber to near vacuum.
                As pressure decreases, the drag on the particle decreases relative to the
              particle inertia resulting in larger deviation of particle trajectory with the
              air streamline.  This will allow more efficient separation of the particles in
              an impact separator.  The proposed project is to demonstrate the effectiveness
              of the idea by experiments and computational modeling of the process.   
              

The proposed idea is innovative with considerable benefits to fine particle
              manufacturing industry, if successful.  The project contains a strong education
              and research integration component with extensive outreach and community
              service.  The Principal Investigators have considerable knowledge and
              experience in this area, as well.
