The proposal seeks support for the developmental biologists
              participating in the interdisciplinary work on Cell Signaling Networks at the
              Aspen Center for Physics scheduled to take place Aug. 19 - Sept. 9, 2001.  This
              workshop will bring together biologists studying a variety of eukaryotic signal
              transduction pathways and the role of cell signaling in embryonic development
              with a group of physicists and engineers interested in quantitative modeling of
              complex biological systems.  The goal of the workshop is to seek ways to
              assimilate and interpret the rapidly accumulating empirical knowledge on
              signaling, to identify most useful subjects and approaches in quantitative
              modeling and to discuss the best experimental strategies for disecting complex
              signaling networks
