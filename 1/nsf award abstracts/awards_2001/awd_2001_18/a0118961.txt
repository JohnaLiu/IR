Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is the metabolic engineering of Bacillus
              subtilis for reduced acid formation and enhanced product yield.  Preliminary
              work in both E. coli and B. subtilis showed that the addition of citrate
              allowed enhancements in growth and product formation.  Acid formation was also
              substantially lowered.  These improvements were tied to the level of pyruvate
              in the cell.  Direct deletion of the pyk gene, NMR experiments, and flux
              modeling confirmed these results.  The specific objectives of this research
              include: (1) improving the performance of B. subtilis which shows reduced
              growth with the pyk mutant, and (2) utilization of these results for the
              improvement of toxin production in Bacillus thuringiensis.
