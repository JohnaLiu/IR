Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for continued work on the mantle section of the Oman
              ophiolite by the PIs and a PhD student whose salary is the major item requested
              in this proposal.  The study is focused on the study of dunite veins and the
              student (Michael Braun) will measure their size, distribution, abundance,
              microstructures, and, in the lab, their compositions.  The aim is to provide
              quantitative constrains on how MORB magma is extracted from the mantle, the
              fluid dynamics of reactive porous flow during melt migration through the
              mantle, and how these processes affect mantle rheology.  Specifically, these
              new studies will approach the question of how much melt has flowed through
              harzburgite as they travel in dunite channels.  The main idea is to test
              between two possible origins of the dunites; reaction haloes around cracks vs.
              diffusive infiltration.  This work complements studies by the PIs of the lower
              crust sections in Oman and has application for studies of the origin of ocean
              crust.
