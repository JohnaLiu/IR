Abstract    :
              This grant will provide support towards a conference to bring together the
              leading researchers in metaheuristics, both from the U. S. and abroad, to
              report their latest research tat is providing advancers in the important and
              fast-growing domains of scatter search and tabu search.  These combined domains
              have proved responsible for providing significant improvements in our ability
              to solve complex real world optimization problems in many areas, including
              telecommunications, transportation, information systems, data mining,
              biomolecular design, resource management, financial planning, logistics CAD/CAM
              systems, water remediation, environmental systems and many others.

The
              conference will be held March 08 - March 10, 2001 at the University of
              Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi.
