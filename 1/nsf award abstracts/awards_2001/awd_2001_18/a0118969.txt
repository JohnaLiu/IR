Abstract    :
              The Ameircan Association of Botanical Gardens and Arboreta (AAGBA) requests a
              24-month conference grant for a professional development workshop, "Starting
              Right:  Team Building and Project Planning," to be presented at all six of the
              AAGBA regional meetings.  The emphasis of this worshop is on the critical early
              planning stages of an informal learning project.  In order to increase the
              professional capacity of those working in botanical gardens and arboreta, the
              primary goals for this workshop are to enhance the ability of
              institutionally-based teams to work together and to define clear goals and
              objectives for a project on which they are working.
