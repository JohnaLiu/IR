Abstract    :
              Over the last decade and during four separate field programs, the PI has
              collected a wide variety of basalt samples from the Southeast Indian Ridge
              (SEIR) between -80'E and -135'E. Overall, there are -2000 samples comprising
              -300 glass groups from >150 localities. The PI proposes to consolidate and
              synthesize these results and to interpret the explained observations, which
              include chemical variations related to regional depth variations of over 2 km.
              This is a very interesting area in terms of the observed variations in depth,
              ridge morphology and mantle domains. In addition to the synthesis, the PI
              requests some support to carry out analyses of trace elements in minerals and
              their melt inclusions using ELA-ICPMS (Excimer laser ablation inductively
              coupled plasma mass spectrometry).
