Abstract    :
              This SGER proposal requests support for an experimental campaign to perform
              correlative studies of lightning and lightning-induced ionospheric effects
              using the Arecibo Observatory (AO) UHF and co-axial VHF radars, a VHF radio
              interferometer, and a VLF receiver.  The campaign will be performed during a
              three-week period in August-September 2001 in Puerto Rico.  

The radar data
              taking modes necessary for the proposed effort exist as do the basic analysis
              and display routines.  The proposed program will employ combination of
              instruments which has never been used before and uniquely qualifies for SGER
              program as small-scale, exploratory research, which can potentially lead to
              major discoveries in the fields of lightning physics and lightning induced
              lower ionospheric effects.
