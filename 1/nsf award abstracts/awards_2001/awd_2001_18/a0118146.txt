Abstract    :
              The proposal has been ranked high among the proposals reviewed at the Robotics
              panel. It received three written reviews, with ratings (V, V, V).  The project
              focuses on general purpose trajectory design algorithms for high dimensional,
              highly nonlinear systems evolving in complex environments. The goal is to solve
              the currently intractable problem of trajectory generation and optimization for
              high-fidelity models of various types of autonomous vehicles, using an approach
              that combines methods from differential geometry, nonlinear control theory,
              robot motion planning, randomized algorithms, and mathematical
              programming.
