Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to study the microbial production of
              flavor compounds based on metabolic and genetic engineering.  The primary
              objective is to investigate the response of the central metabolic pathway in
              Escherichia coli in the presence of perturbations in the cofactor CoA.  The
              specific goals of the research are to: (1) study the redistribution of
              metabolic fluxes in E. coli with alteration of CoA metabolism by the use of
              mutant strains with perturbations either in the synthesis or in the usage
              pathways of the cofactor CoA, (2) examine the effect of these genetic
              manipulations on the cellular capacity to produce flavor compounds under
              defined bioreactor experiments, and (3) perform directed evolution of the
              alcohol acetyltransferase to alter its specificity to make a different pattern
              of esters.  The framework developed in this research could be applied to the
              improvement of metabolic function for bioprocess applications related to
              biobased industrial products.
