This award supports a one-year Japan Society for the
              Promotion of Science (JSPS) postdoctoral Fellowship for Bruce R. Schatz of the
              University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.  He will be undertaking his research
              with Professor Toru Ishida in the Department of Social Informatics at Kyoto
              University in Japan.  Dr. Schatz will be researching trends in the information
              infrastructure.  He hopes to determine if there are Laws of the Net which
              predict the behavior of effective algorithms for future technologies of
              information retrieval.  He will be researching the evolution of information
              infrastructure placing the past, present and future technology in its proper
              historical context.  He will explore the 30-year period from syntactic to
              structure to semantics.  In addition, he will be studying the mass
              infrastructure for network information systems, such as the 300-year period
              from 19th century Networks to 20th century Spaces to 21st century Models.  He
              will further explore the philosophical foundations of new technologies for
              information retrieval in the Net.

The research should result in new
              paradigms for information technology, with broad impact on the field especially
              in the area of digital libraries.  The exposure of the awardee to a new
              research setting will be intellectually stimulating.  The collaboration should
              also facilitate further international cooperation in science and technology,
              and help to facilitate the number of excellent students from the Asian region
              to the
