Abstract    :
              This study will examine the ways in which Information and Communication
              Technologies (ICTs) enable the development of collaborative, boundary-spanning
              networks between academic and industry scientists working in three disciplinary
              areas, 1) oceanography, 2) marine biology and 3) astronomy. The methodology
              combines survey techniques with semi-structured interviews, in-depth case
              studies, and network analysis to provide a detailed view of how these
              scientists use ICTs to gather data, store and share information, and
              communicate with one another. The results of this research will provide a
              better understanding of the use of ICTs in inter-organizational scientific
              collaborations, and the ways in which these collaborations may enable economic
              development, technological innovation, and advances in science.
