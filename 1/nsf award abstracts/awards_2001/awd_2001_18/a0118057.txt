Abstract    :
              This award supports graduate students and young researchers to participate in
              the Chapman Conference, "Atmospheric Absorption", to be held August 13-17, 2001
              at Estes Park, Colorado.  The purpose of the conference is to bring together a
              small number of experts from a wide range of disciplines to focus attention on
              the fundamental concepts of measuring and modeling atmospheric absorption of
              solar radiation in an effort to solve a problem that has plagued the
              atmospheric sciences community for a number of years.  This is the so-called
              "excess absorption" issue, i.e., theoretical models under-predict atmospheric
              solar absorption when compared with (some) published measurements.  The
              parenthetic "some" is the basis for the intense controversy that surrounds this
              issue.  This is an important issue because the "excess absorption" is thought
              to be relatively large, ~25-30 watts/m2, and so would have a strong impact on
              the details of atmospheric heating and circulation in climate model
              simulations.
