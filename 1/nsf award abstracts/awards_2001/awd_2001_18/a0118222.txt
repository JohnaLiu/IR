International Conference on LOCAL AND NANOSCALE STRUCTURE IN
              COMPLEX SYSTEMS will be held September 16-21, 2001 in Santa Fe, New Mexico,
              USA.  The purpose of this meeting is to discuss how the nanoscale arrangements
              of atoms in solids and molecules determine the properties of complex systems,
              from experimental as well as theoretical perspective.  Examples of complex
              systems include strongly correlated electron systems such as superconducting
              cuprates and magnetostrictive (CMR) manganites, heavy fermion metals, relaxor
              ferroelectrics, catalysts, polymers and other soft or molecular compounds, and
              proteins.    
%%%
The subject of this conference is at the cutting edge of
              condensed matter and materials physics.  Graduate students and postdoctoral
              fellows will be greatly stimulated and learn from attending this conference. 
              We plan to spend 60 % of the grant on students and postdoctoral fellows who do
              not have other means of support.  The rest will be spent for inviting young and
              promising researchers who will not be able to attend the conference without
              support.
