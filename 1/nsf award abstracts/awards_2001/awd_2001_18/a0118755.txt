Abstract    :
              This proposal is to solicit support for exchanging experience in civil
              infrastructures for a group of prospective participants from the United States
              at the International Conference and Exhibition on "Extending the Life of
              Bridges, Civil and Building Structures," London, United Kingdom, July 4-6,
              2001. The focus of the conference is on bridge investigation and repair,
              concrete and composites, and buildings and civil structures All these topics
              are important issues pertaining to the performance and safety of civil
              infrastructure systems in the United States. It is expected that the conference
              will help identify potential cooperative research topics between the
              participants from the United States and the United Kingdom on advancing both
              the state-of-the-art and  the state-of-the-practice in performance evaluation,
              safety assessment and life-cycle management of civil infrastructure systems.
              Research is needed in these fields to enhance our understanding of the
              performance of civil infrastructure systems, to improve current methods for
              design and safety assessment of new and existing structural systems, and to
              permit an optimal management of the civil infrastructure systems in the United
              States.
