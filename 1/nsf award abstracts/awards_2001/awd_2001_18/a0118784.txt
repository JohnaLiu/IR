Abstract    :
              The design of efficient wireless communication systems relies on a
deep
              understanding of the basic characteristics of the underlying
channel.  The
              most fundamental and unique characteristic of wireless
channels is the random
              time-variation of the channel strengths, a
phenomenon known as fading. 
              Communication over fading channels has
been a topic of study since the 60's. 
              A very different view of the
problem, however, emerges from recent research. 
              The traditional view
of fading is that it is a source of unreliability that
              has to be
compensated for by various diversity techniques.  The modern view
              is
much more
powerful and considers fading as a source of randomization from
              nature
that can be exploited to get very significant capacity boost.

The
              research project addresses several key problems within this
modern paradigm.
              They will be centered around two areas: 1)
opportunistic communication : the
              dynamic rate and power allocation
over the dimensions of time, frequency,
              antennas and users
so that transmission is done when and where the channel is
              strong;
2) multi-antenna communication: the use of  multiple transmit
              and
receive antennas to increase the number of degrees of freedom
              available
for communication in richly scattered fading environments. The
              issues
studied are focused on how the random fading can be exploited even
              in
the face of
channel uncertainty, and the interplay between the modern
              and
traditional views of channel fading.
