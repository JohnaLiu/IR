Abstract    :
              This project will continue modeling studies of the dynamics of flow in the
              oceanic upper mantle.  The emphasis ofthese studies will be shifted to
              intraplate, off-axis processes, exploring mechanisms of oceanic matle dynamics
              that can explain intraplate volcanism and tectonics.  Numerical and labratory
              experiments will be carried out.  Initially, three mechanisms will be explored;
              convective instability, tensile cracks in the lithosphere, and viscous
              fingering of low-viscosity mantle into higher viscosity mantle during return
              flow.
