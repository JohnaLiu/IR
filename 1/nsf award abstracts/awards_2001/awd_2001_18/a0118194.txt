Abstract    :
              The objective of this study is to improve the capability of the Community
              Climate System Model (CCSM) by helping to develop and implement a dynamic
              vegetation component into the CCSM land model. The present land model, while
              providing detailed information of water, heat, momentum, and carbon dioxide
              (CO2) exchanges between land/atmosphere, uses a prescribed vegetation structure
              and coverage and thus cannot assess important feedbacks between vegetation and
              climate. A dynamic vegetation model, whose vegetation structure and coverage is
              most compatible with the land model prescription, has been chosen to integrate
              into the CCSM land model. Major-coupled experiments will consist of a
              pre-industrial model run, enhanced CO2 experiments, and a paleo-simulation of
              the mid-Holocene (6000 years ago). The work is important because it will
              increase our understanding of vegetation-climate interactions, on both paleo
              and shorter time-scales.
