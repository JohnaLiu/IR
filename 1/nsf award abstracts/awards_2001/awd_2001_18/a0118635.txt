Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of algorithms, theory, and
              applications for the identification of all minimal representatives, for
              implicitly given monotone systems. Such systems are a frequent target of
              knowledge discovery as they represent important information hidden in large
              databases, complex networks, etc. Problems involving the determination of
              monotone systems arise naturally in a multitude of areas including: data mining
              (finding all maximal frequent, minimal infrequent sets); text mining (finding
              the best linear query in vector space models); machine learning (finding the
              best rules or patterns); hypergraph dualization (generating all minimal
              transversals); reliability theory (generating all minimal working and/or
              maximal failing states); integer programming (generating all minimal feasible
              solutions); stochastic programming (constructing deterministic equivalents to
              certain stochastic models); etc. A coherent theory of identification problems
              for monotone systems based on several recent mathematical results will be
              developed. Tractable classes will be outlined, efficient algorithms for such
              classes created and realized by programs. The resulting new methods will be
              tested on a variety of applications, such as data mining, logical data
              analysis, machine learning and text mining.
