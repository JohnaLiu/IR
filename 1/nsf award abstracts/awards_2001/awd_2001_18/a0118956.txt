Description:  This award is for support of a US-Turkey
              Workshop on Geothechnical Engineering Research to be held in conjunction with
              the International Conference on Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering
              (ICSMGE) in Istanbul, Turkey.  The ICSMGE is planned for August 27-31, 2001 and
              the workshop will to follow on September 1, 2001. The US organizer is Dr.
              Mehmet Tumay, Professor of Civil Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton
              Rouge, Louisiana.  The Turkish co-organizer is Dr. Ergun Togrol, Faculty of
              Civil Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey. The purpose
              of the workshop is to discuss the emerging issues and technologies in
              geotechnical engineering that will result from the ICSMGE, and to identify
              selected research areas for mutually beneficial collaboration. 

Scope:  This
              award will support a US-Turkey workshop in an area that is increasingly gaining
              importance in both countries and in countries of west Asia and the Caucasus. 
              The study of soil behavior is important for assessing the safety of structures
              in unusual or severe loading conditions, such as during liquifaction due to
              increased water content (floods) or due to strong ground motion (earthquakes).
              The development of guidelines for design and use of structures in these
              conditions will benefit all countries involved in this research.  Most of the
              supported US participants are junior scientists who will have a unique
              opportunity to meet with colleagues from Turkey and several countries in the
              region during the ICSMGE Conference and the US-Turkey Workshop.  They will also
              visit Turkish laboratories to discuss possible joint research.   Both the US
              and Turkish organizers have excellent experiences and capabilities in the
              field, and they will have the backing of important organizations such as the
              American Society of Civil Engineers and Istanbul Technical University.  
              Funding for this project is provided by the Division of International Programs
              and the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems.
