Abstract    :
              

	Collaborative research and training activities at the University of Utah's
              Price Institute for Phthirapteran Research and the Illinois Natural History
              Survey will result in the first comprehensive world catalog of chewing lice in
              half a century, a monographic revision of the family Goniodidae, and training a
              new generation of scientists with expertise in the taxonomy of chewing lice. 
              Intensive field research will result in much new material and in important
              experiences for students in the project.  Morphological and molecular data will
              be integrated to hypothesize a phylogeny for Goniodidae, and support the
              multi-authored monograph of the family.

	Chewing lice of are great interest
              because of their accessibility as models for population biology, parasitic
              adaptation, host selection, and co-speciation and because of their medical and
              veterinary importance.  There are few living experts on chewing lice.  This
              project will contribute directly to the training of one postdoctoral researcher
              and three doctoral students who will be involved in all aspects of the research
              from field work to taxonomic revisions and monography.  Among the results will
              be web accessibility to a world catalog of chewing lice and the first modern,
              phylogenetic monograph of a large, important family of chewing lice.
