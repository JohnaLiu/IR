Abstract    :
              This is a study of a family of complementary fragments from oxidized E. coli
              thioredoxin (Trx) and their heterodimeric reassemblies around different
              interfaces.  The values of estimated buried surface from DSC studies of
              intrinsically unstructured protein fragments will be correlated with NMR
              studies of conformational preferences and rigidity of the backbone at the
              residue level. This project combines three areas of expertise (protein fragment
              complementation, calorimetry of proteins, and NMR analysis of structure and
              dynamics of proteins) and centers on two main hypotheses: (1) Isolated Trx
              fragments which comprise the regions of the native 2 and 4 strands have
              substantial nonlocal interactions between them, while remaining intrinsically
              unstructured. (2) The differences in delta G of folding/binding among the
              different heterodimeric reassemblies are mainly due to differences in the
              degree of folding and rigidity in the isolated fragments.  In order to test
              these hypotheses,  the delta G of folding/binding and low-resolution structural
              characterization of the initial and final states for a family of complementary
              fragments will be determined.  High sensitivity DSC studies of selected
              isolated fragments and heterodimeric reassemblies will be undertaken, and NMR
              studies of the structures of the initial and final states of selected
              complementary fragments will be done to study the dynamics of such a selected
              pair in both states.

 The long-term objective of these studies is to
              characterize the conformational space of the unfolded state of proteins and
              understand protein-protein interactions covering a range of affinities and
              degree of folding associated with binding through a synergistic interaction
              between experimenation and theory.
