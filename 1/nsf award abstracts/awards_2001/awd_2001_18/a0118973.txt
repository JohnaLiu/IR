A U.S./Africa workshop on Materials and Infrastructure for
              Development will be organized in San Diego from June 25-27, 2001.  The workshop
              is an extension of one of the break-out sessions at the NSF-sponsored US/Africa
              workshop that was held in Pretoria in August, 2000.  The workshop will bring
              together researchers from Africa, South America, Europe and the United States
              to interact within a basic research framework that will stimulate materials and
              infrastructure development within the U.S., Africa and a global framework.  The
              workshop will also provide opportunities between African and U.S. researchers
              that could result ultimately in synergisms that are not possible within
              national or continental boundaries.  In an effort to ensure subsequent
              interactions, participants from outside the U.S. will be given the opportunity
              to visit potential collaborators within the U.S. before returning to their home
              countries.  The highlights of the symposium will be published on a web-site
              that will be developed to disseminate the information from the workshop to a
              worldwide audience.  The technical papers from the workshop will be published
              in the International Journal of Concrete and Cement Composites after a rigorous
              review process.  Travel assistance will be provided to 12 invited speakers, two
              graduate students and one post-doctoral research associate.  An undergraduate
              student will also be supported to assist with the development of the workshop
              web-site.
