This project focuses on understanding the interactions of the
              Arctic Ocean outflow waters and Nordic Sea waters as they create the Denmark
              Strait Overflow Water (DSOW) and the Iceland-Scotland Overflow water (ISOW) on
              the one hand and the Arctic Ocean influenced layers in the Nordic Seas on the
              other. Specific goals include: (1) determining the sources and pathways of
              fresh water out of the Arctic Ocean and studying the processes modifying
              downstream water masses; (2) determining the sources and characteristics of
              intermediate and deep waters of Arctic origin and their subsequent modification
              as they are exported in the Nordic Seas and North Atlantic Ocean; and (3)
              determining the pathways of Atlantic water through the Nordic Seas and into the
              Arctic Ocean and how it transforms Nordic Seas water masses. This new synoptic
              survey of the Nordic Seas will provide a baseline observation to understand the
              links between the various ocean basins in the region. This project is
              collaborative with Swedish scientists and is a contribution to the Climate
              variability and predictability program (CLIVAR).
