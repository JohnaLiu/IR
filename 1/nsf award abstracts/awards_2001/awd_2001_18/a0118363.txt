The purpose of the is project is to use numerical
              modeling to examine the routes by which the upper return flow in the South
              Atlantic carries heat and salt across the basin and the role that mesoscale
              eddies play in this transport.  First, diagnostic studies of existing global
              and Atlantic simulations will be made.  This will be followed by process
              studies designed to test hypotheses about the paths of Pacific and Indian Ocean
              upper thermocline waters through the South Atlantic to the tropics.   The
              project's broad goals are: (1) to understand how changes in magnitude of
              southern sources of water, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Agulhas
              Current, affect the magnitude and relative composition of South Atlantic upper
              ocean export to the tropics, (2) to understand the mechanisms that regulate the
              mean circulation and variability of the subtropical gyre and their linkage to
              interocean exchanges, and (3) to determine the sensitivity of the South
              Atlantic circulation to changes in wind forcing in the southern hemisphere.
