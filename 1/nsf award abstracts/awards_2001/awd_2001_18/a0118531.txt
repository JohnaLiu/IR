Abstract    :
              In a suite of seismic experiments conducted in 1999 and 2000 microseismicity,
              regional and teleseismic earthquake events were recorded on an array of twenty
              seafloor instruments and 23 PASSCAL stations deployed on islands around the
              Western Woodlark Basin.  Preliminary data analysis was completed in the
              original grant period, and this project will continue that effort.  More data
              were collected than anticipated, and in particular, the preliminary receiver
              function data have proven a fertile source of information on regional crustal
              structure.
