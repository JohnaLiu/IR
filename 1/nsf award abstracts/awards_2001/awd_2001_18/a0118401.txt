The project supports the design, construction and
              testing of a new instrument to measure velocity on vertical scales that range
              from the microscale to the depth of the ocean.   This instrument will have the
              unique capacity to obtain profiles of turbulent quantities to within a few
              meters of the bottom of the deep ocean and thus be able to sample both the
              upper part of the bottom boundary layer and the ocean interior.  The design is
              based on an existing profiler that is nearing the end of its working life. 
              However, design enhancements will permit closer approaches to the sea-floor,
              more accurate measurements and greater data storage.  It is anticipated that
              the instrument will be used in future research into a variety of scientific
              questions about the ocean in which small-scale mixing and small-scale structure
              in the density field are important.  These include questions about the
              maintenance and evolution of the large-scale stratification and circulation of
              the ocean as well as questions concerned with how tracers are mixed through the
              ocean.
