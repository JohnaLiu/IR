Abstract    :
              This award funds a conference in algebraic geometry 
at the University of
              Missouri-Columbia, April 5-6, 2002.
The conference focuses on Hilbert schemes,
              vector bundles
and their interplay with representation theory. 
It has two
              main goals. The first is to provide a forum for 
algebraic geometers to meet
              with colleagues and learn of 
recent research developments in these focused
              areas. 
The second is to give graduate students, recent Ph.D's and women
an
              opportunity to broaden their mathematical horizons. 
The conference includes 8
              hour-long invited talks addressed by 
leading mathematicians, and about 20
              shorter communications.

The focused areaes of the conference are at the
              central stage 
of recent confluence between mathematics and physics. 
The
              mathematical achievements in these focused areaes 
provide solid mathematical
              foundation 
to the physics theories which are vital to explain the
              universe.
In addition, the conference will have a high impact on diversity,
              
as well as scientific and educational activities.
