Abstract    :
                 Several behaviors are differentially expressed in male and female mammals as
              adults, typically regulated by the levels of steroid hormones that were present
              during early postnatal development.  A number of differences in the brain also
              have been correlated with sex differences in behavior, including differences in
              numbers and density of particular nuclei (clusters of nerve cells) in parts of
              the brain.  Changes in these neural parameters suggest that changes also are
              required in the afferent and efferent neural connections of these nuclei.  This
              project combines hormonal treatments with quantitative neuroanatomy to test the
              hypothesis that neonatal steroids regulate male sexual behavior by regulating
              the development of the number, density, and interconnections of neurons in the
              magnocellular part of the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN mag), which is involved
              in olfactory-driven male sexual behavior.
   This study provides a unique
              opportunity to clarify functional roles of neuronal differences in sexually
              dimorphic structures in the brain, and will be important for future molecular
              studies underlying dimorphic neurogenesis, so the impact will extend to
              developmental biology.  In addition, the broader impact promotes research by a
              woman investigator from an underrepresented group, who is actively involved in
              increasing the representation of minority students in scientific
              research.
