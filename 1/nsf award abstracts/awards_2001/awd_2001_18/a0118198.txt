Abstract    :
              
The PI proposes to conduct experiments on the melting of peridotite in order
              to quantitatively determine the effect of melt structure on trace element
              partitioning at the peridotite, solidus at pressures of 1.5 to 3.0 Gpa. The
              experiments will test the hypothesis that isobaric differences in trace element
              partitioning can be related to differences in the extent of polymerization of
              the melt-to be evaluated with new measurements of viscosity. The experiments
              will be carried out on appropriate bulk compositions doped with a few ppm of
              the elements of interest (a range of REE, LIL, and I-IFSE), with analyses of
              partitioning to be done with the ion microprobe on cpx, opx, and garnet and
              glass in quenched experimental charges. The results will have numerous
              applications to melting in the earth's mantle.
