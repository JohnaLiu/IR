Abstract    :
              In this project, funds are requested for a two-year research program to
              investigate basic plasma processes that seem to be responsible for the
              surprisingly strong energetics that have been observed in the midlatitude E
              region. The research plan is to utilize a numerical model of the phenomenon
              already developed by the PI to model realistic distortions of an Es layer,
              apply the results to the design of radar experiments at SRI, and to the design
              of the SEEK-2 rocket campaign, in order to determine if the model can explain
              the experimental findings.
