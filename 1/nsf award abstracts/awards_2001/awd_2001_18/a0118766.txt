Abstract    :
              The Acari, ticks and mites, includes the greatest diversity of animals outside
              of the insects.  In spite of its great diversity, the study of acarine
              systematics, evolution, and ecology is hampered by a declining number of active
              taxonomic specialists.  This study focuses on two major lineages of parasitic
              mites associated with mammals:  Dermanyssoidea and Sarcoptoidea.  These groups,
              with more than 1,000 species, have never been analyzed phylogenetically at the
              suprageneric level.  Field studies will concentrate on poorly known faunas in
              Madagascar and the Philippines.  Taxonomic monographs will be produced for
              several families for these insular areas including descriptions of many new
              species, phylogenetic hypotheses integrating morphological and molecular
              evidence, and catalogs of mammalian hosts for all dermanyssoid and sarcoptoid
              groups worldwide.

This research will have immediate and longterm benefits to
              a wide range of biologists.  It will provide a predictive, conceptual framework
              for a large number of mites of medical, veterinary, ecological, and
              evolutionary interest as well as an easily accessible source for identification
              and host information.  Concentration on the endangered faunas of Madagascar and
              the Philippines may also aid conservation biologists and epidemiologists in
              understanding the interactions of native and introduced host-parasite systems
              and their roles in these rapidly changing ecosystems.  Students will develop
              skills and knowledge in both morphological and molecular methods of systematic
              analysis.  In all, three graduate students and a great number of undergraduate
              students will be trained in the systematics, ecology, and evolution of
              parasitic mites.  Results of the research will be made accessible
              electronically.
