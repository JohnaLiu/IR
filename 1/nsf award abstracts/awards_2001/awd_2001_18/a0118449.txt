Wind gustiness produces small waves that modulate the
              surface shear implying a transition from laminar to turbulent flow in the near
              surface layer and causing disruption of the surface skin layer.  The PIs
              propose to confirm the presence of small scale Langmuir circulations under
              typical wind conditions, to determine the space and time scales associated with
              the surface turbulence, to examine the impact on the associated surface
              renewal, and to compare the experimental results with numerical and theoretical
              model predictions.  Deployment of their laser-based PIV system in a lake will
              occur in year one (and possibly a FLIP deployment).  A FLIP deployment will
              occur in year two with emphasis on understanding the heat flux budget in the
              ocean surface layers.  Year three will include analysis, study of ancillary
              processes such as the role of surfactants, modeling, a second FLIP experiment
              with a focus on the relationships of renewal and turbulence-laminar flow
              transition to gustiness and its associated scales.  Year four will be devoted
              to analysis and writing.
