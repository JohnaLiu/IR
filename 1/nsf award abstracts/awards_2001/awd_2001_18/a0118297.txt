The White Mountain Research Station (WMRS)
              Barcroft Observatory site will be used make measurements of the polarization of
              the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) in order to assess the site for
              its usefulness for mm and submillimeter wavelength astronomy and to perform
              cutting edge original scientific research on a very important aspect of CMB:
              its polarization.  Measurements of the amplitude and spatial distribution of
              CMB polarization along with its correlation with the temperature anisotropy
              will provide profound information about the structure,  evolution and
              ionization history of the University.  Assessing the site, which looks very
              promising, will open up a US mainland site for sub-submillimeter wave astronomy
              enabling less expensive site visits than now possible using off-shore
              observatories and thus enable its frequent scientifically productive use by
              students.
