This project will produce a printed and an online atlas of the
              Indian Ocean WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) Hydrographic Program
              (WHP) data. The goals of the Indian Ocean WHP were similar to those for the
              other basins -to obtain basic hydrographic and chemical tracer data to allow
              basin-wide estimates of transports. Specific goals included obtaining as much
              information as possible about Indian Ocean overturning and quantifying the
              throughput of near-surface water from the Pacific to the Atlantic. The project
              requires acquiring and processing the Indian Ocean WHP data sets from the WHP
              Office (WHPO), assisting the WHPO if needed in completing these data sets,
              gridding, plotting each of the WHP parameters, providing online access to the
              preliminary graphics for interaction with the individual investigators, final
              drafting of the plots, and forwarding to the International WOCE Project Office
              in Southampton for printing. Online atlas development will proceed in parallel
              with that for the Pacific, Southern Ocean and Atlantic. The printed WHP atlases
              will likely also contain maps showing the mean flow and statistics from the
              Lagrangian float and drifter measurements. If included, the mapped values will
              be provided by the float and drifter groups.
