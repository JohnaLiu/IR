Abstract    :
                    Rhythmic oscillating activity is a property of many biological systems,
              and we are still far from understanding the theoretical basis for mechanisms
              driving such rhythms.  In the nervous systems of many animals, networks that
              produce oscillations often have to be stable, yet capable of modulation or
              switching between different modes.  These networks often have individual
              properties that have made it difficult to sort out what key elements are
              responsible for stability in oscillators.  This project develops new analytical
              methods to predict oscillatory patterns exhibited by neural circuits composed
              of physiological neurons (living nerve cells, not just modeled ones), using
              only data that are readily obtainable from the isolated component neurons.  A
              novel approach here uses computational analysis of phase-resetting curves to
              make theoretical predictions of network behavior, and to test whether these
              theoretical methods apply to physiological data from small neuronal circuits in
              crustaceans.  
    Results will have a substantial impact on understanding
              oscillating systems in the brain (such as those for locomotion, respiration,
              and sleep-wake cycles), and could extend beyond neuroscience into areas such as
              ecology and even non-living physical oscillating systems.  This project also
              develops a fruitful collaboration among four women scientists at a range of
              levels in the computational field, where they are under-represented, with
              consequent opportunities for mentoring, and an impact on women's careers.
