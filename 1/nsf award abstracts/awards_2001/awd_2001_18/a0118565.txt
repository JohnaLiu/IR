Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to determine how carotenoid
              biosynthesis can be evolved to increase the variety of carotenoid structures
              that can be synthesized.  This research will proceed at two levels.  Individual
              biosynthetic enzymes are to be subjected to sequential rounds of mutagenesis
              and recombination.  Carefully designed screens will detect altered biosynthetic
              function.  Carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes with altered functions will then be
              combined to create new pathways.  By correlating amino acid changes with
              changes in biosynthetic function, insights can be gleaned into how biosynthetic
              function may be further altered as well as how nature may evolve pathway
              function.  Also, this research could provide the requisite understanding to
              approach modifications of more difficult or complex pathways.
