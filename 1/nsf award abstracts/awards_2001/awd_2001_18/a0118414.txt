Support is requested for an international conference on plant growth and
              development to be held in Brno, Czech Republic from July 1-6, 2001. This
              conference will be the 17th in a series of conferences sponsored by the
              International Plant Growth Substance Association (IPGSA). These meetings are
              held every three years and the last two were convened in Minnesota (1995) and
              Makuhari Messe, Tokyo (1998). Progress in understanding the perception and
              action of plant hormones has advanced at a rapid pace as a result of advances
              in the areas of genetics and molecular cloning. These advances have led to the
              identification of genes that are involved in the perception of hormonal
              signals, and plant biologists are now beginning to unravel the signal
              transduction pathways that link hormone receptors to cellular response. The
              recent publication of the complete Arabidopsis thaliana and rice genome
              sequences will see an even more dramatic advances in our understanding of
              hormone action, and genomics approaches will feature prominently in the Brno
              meeting. The goals of the 17th International Conference on Plant Growth
              Substances are to bring together researchers who are working in this field to
              report on new developments and to share new ideas. Our goal is to introduce
              younger investigators to this exciting area and the funds provided from this
              grant will be used to support the travel and lodging of junior US investigators
              to this meeting. Topics to be covered in plenary sessions and symposia include
              signal transduction, hormone homeostasis, the roles of hormones in responses to
              environmental stresses, the use and application of transgenic plants in hormone
              research, the identification of new signalling molecules, the interaction of
              hormones with pathogens and symbionts, and hormone perception and sensitivity.
              The program promises to be exciting and to stimulate research on plant growth
              regulators. These compounds have long been established as important for U.S.
              agriculture, and our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of their
              action is essential for the long-term sustainability of agriculture.
