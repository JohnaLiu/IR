Abstract    :
              The National Research Council (NRC) through its Division on Engineering and
              Physical Sciences, will conduct a workshop to investigate the potential role
              for NSF in innovative research for improved fire safety. The purpose of this
              workshop will be to survey and assess the current state of knowledge, research,
              education, and training in the fire safety field. The results of the workshop
              will help to define how best to marshal U.S. intellectual, financial, and
              institutional resources to develop the knowledge necessary to save lives and
              reduce injuries and property loss from fire. The final report will specifically
              address the potential of the National Science Foundation to serve as an
              incubator for basic and interdisciplinary research, professional collaboration,
              graduate and undergraduate education, and technology transfer in the field of
              fire safety.
