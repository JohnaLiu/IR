Abstract    :
              This award provides support for student attendance at the annual meeting of the
              Division of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics (DAMOP) of the American
              Physical Society.  The meeting will be held jointly with the Division of Atomic
              and Molecular Physics of the Canadian Physical Society in London, Ontario,
              16-19 May, 2001. This is the principal meeting covering principles of AMO
              physics held each year, and this award gives students the opportunity to
