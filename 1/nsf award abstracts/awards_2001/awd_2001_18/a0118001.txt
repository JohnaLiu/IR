Abstract    :
              Summary:  This proposal requests support to test new observations indicating
              that the current model for deep water circulation patterns and structure
              derived from studies of the last glacial maximum are not typical of most
              Pleistocene glacial intervals.  Preliminary results suggest that, in contrast
              to the established conveyor belt model,  Labrador Sea Water (LSW) and Norwegian
              Sea Overflow Water (NSOW) continued to form albeit with different d13C
              signatures during many Pleistocene glacials.  The concept will be tested by
              developing multiproxy data sets forming depth transects of the North Atlantic
              at three time intervals to map conditions at different depths and between
              sediment drift sites (path of NSOW) and non-sediment drift sites (path of LSW).
