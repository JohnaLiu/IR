Abstract    :
              0118536

This ocean sciences technology development project will develop, and
              make available to the oceanographic community, an inexpensive next-generation
              RAFOS float using a modern, energy-efficient microprocessor and a robust
              operating system. The RAFOS-specific functions will be built around a
              commercially available microprocessor system adapted for our application. The
              technology will be made available to the community either through a bidding
              process or via a vendor committed to providing service at a reasonable price.
              The goal is to achieve a material cost per float of about $1200 when produced
              in volume. The work addresses a need for an inexpensive float that can be
              deployed in large numbers in order to properly sample the wide range of
              variability inherent to ocean currents and in order to obtain statistically
              significant estimates of mean flow.  Work entails development of a surface
              mount electronics board and operating system that will make it much easier for
              present and new users to undertake a wide variety of Lagrangian studies.
