Abstract    :
              The project will address the need for taxonomic research and training on one of
              the dominant faunal groups in the marine environment, the polychaete annelid
              worms.  Four families will form the core of taxonomic work, the Cirratulidae,
              Orbiniidae, Scalibregmatidae, and Spionidae.  The primary monographic focus
              will be on the Cirratulidae in which homology of characters is controversial
              and genera currently poorly defined.  Data base activities will focus on making
              as much information as possible accessible for these four polychaete families. 
              Comparative studies will use a wide range of techniques and characters
              including light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, reproductive biology,
              larval morphology and development, and development, and molecular techniques
              where appropriate.

	This work will make many common and important components
              of marine environments accurately identifiable and will train a doctoral
              student in modern systematic methods.  This student will develop a dissertation
              based upon a portion of the monograph of Cirratulidae, thereby acquiring the
              special knowledge and skills needed for a career in polychaete taxonomy. 
              Conclusions will be made accessible to a wide user community via the World Wide
              Web.
