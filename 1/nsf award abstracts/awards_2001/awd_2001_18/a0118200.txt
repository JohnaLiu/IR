It is proposed to study transport between the
              Pacific and Indian Oceans by assimilating current meter data collected in the
              Makassar Strait into a regional circulation model.  Results of the model will
              be compared with observations of the distribution of chlorofluorocarbons in the
              waters of the region and with the trajectories of drifting floats.  The goal is
              to develop a clearer picture of the regional circulation and its variability
              and to understand the mechanisms controlling the bifurcation of the flow
              leaving the Makassar Strait.  The work will include an analysis of momentum and
              energy budgets and a study of the dependence of transport through the Makassar
              Strait on the pressure head.   In addition to work with a numerical model in a
              realistic domain, the project will also include an idealized process study to
              examine the influence of different aspects of the regional topography on the
              flow bifurcation at the southern end of the Makassar Strait.  By developing a
              better understanding of the nature of the regional circulation and of the
              mechanisms that control it, the project will contribute to an improved
              knowledge of the processes controlling the exchange of heat and fresh water
              between two major oceans.
