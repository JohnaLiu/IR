This award supports partially the participation by 30 American
              faculty in the Engineering Foundation Conference, "Chemical Separations:
              Refocusing Chemical Engineering", to be held in Barga, Italy, from May 27 to
              June 1, 2001.  This conference is the successor to earlier conferences on
              chemical separations.  This particular meeting will explore the changing nature
              of the chemical industry and the implications for chemical-engineering research
              and education.  Case studies will be used to seek new ways of organizing the
              field, both in education and research, in order to meet emerging
              needs.

Funding is provided to support  partially participation by ten
              invited speakers and twenty junior faculty from the U.S. Both academic and
              industrial researchers will participate in sessions on Process Intensification,
              Chemical Products, and New Paradigms.
