Abstract    :
              The rapidly emerging areas of nanoscale science and technology are focussed on
              the design, fabrication, and characterization of functional objects having
              dimensions at the nanometer length scale. New advances in this emerging area
              are expected to have long range implications in a wide variety of different
              scientific and engineering disciplines. The importance of nanoscale science is
              growing worldwide and it is now widely recognized as a critical component to
              the future growth of the US economy. The U.S. National Science and Technology
              Council has identified this area as a major contributor to the 21st Century
              science and technology workforce. As a consequence, former President Clinton
              has made the National Nanotechnology Initiative a top priority within US
              funding agencies. In response to the growing awareness of the importance of
              nantechnology, many conferences are being organized worldwide to discuss the
              latest advances. A travel grant is requested to allow approximately 12 US
              scientists plus 10 US graduate students to participate and attend an important
              international event, the annual Trends in Nanotechnology 2001 Conference
              (TNT200I) - one of the premier European conferences devoted to nanoscale
              science and technology.
