Abstract    :
              Hurtado, Hill
Throughout South America, indigenous communities are less
              economically prosperous and more vulnerable to infectious diseases than are
              neighboring rural peasant non-indigenous communities. Little is known about the
              extent to which economic prosperity is affected by the health status of adults
              in diverse rural communities.  This project will study the relationship between
              health and economic productivity.  In association with a public health project
              funded by NIH, the NSF project will do preliminary work to prepare for a major
              project to test hypotheses derived from a causal path model with adult health
              status as the predictor variable, economic productivity and various aspects of
              economic decision making as intermediate variables, and the well-being of
              household members as the outcome variable; examine and control for the effects
              of ethnicity on causal variables in the model; determine to what extent
              variation in health status across communities accounts for differences in
              economic prosperity in the communities in the Mbaracayu Reserve in eastern
              Paraguay.
