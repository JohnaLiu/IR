Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed research is to use in vitro metabolic engineering
              combined with combinatorial biology and microscale processing to evaluate the
              functional diversity of a complex metabolic network, namely, polyketide
              synthesis.  The investigators will develop a microscale, microfluidic device
              for the in vitro combinatorial biosynthesis of complex polyketides.  Also,
              because of the microscale component and the modularity of the polyketide
              synthesis, the investigators expect to use the principles of multi-step
              enzymatic networks (e.g., a metabolic pathway) to alter the progress of the
              pathway and generate unique compounds.  The class of polyketides used in this
              research consists of a small number of polypeptides each containing multiple
              modules.  Each module is responsible for one round of chain extension and
              post-condensation modifications.  The modules will be immobilized into the
              channels of the microfabricated device, a mutant thioesterase domain will be
              engineered into each module (necessary for release and transport to the next
              module), and the products will be transported from one module to the next.  
              This research could enable the synthesis of molecules with new and unusual
              functions.  Also, this research could add to the fundamental understanding of
              metabolic pathways and microfluidics.
