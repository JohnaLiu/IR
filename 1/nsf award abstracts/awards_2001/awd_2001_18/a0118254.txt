Abstract    :
              The Mantle Electromagnetic and Tomography (MELT) geophysical experiment, carried
              out around 17 degrees south on the East Pacific Rise, utilized seismic and
              electromagnetic observations to determine the geometry of the region of partial
              melting and the pattern of upwelling beneath a spreading ridge.  This project
              will further the analysis of the MELT electromagnetic data by : (1) developing
              an improved, numberical-based approach for stripping out the topographic
              effects from the seafloor, (2) developing an anisotropic version of a 2D
              inversion algorithm, (3) applying both of these tools to the MELT data, and (4)
              conducting an integration of the MELT seismic and electromagnetic data.
