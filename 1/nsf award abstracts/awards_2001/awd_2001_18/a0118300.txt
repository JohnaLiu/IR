Abstract    :
              The power industry must undertake a managed redesign of the Nation's power
              system so that it can adapt to deregulation and to rapid changes in the power
              requirements and regional economic conditions.  The need for research in this
              area is vividly illustrated by the recent California power problems.  This
              second five year continuing grant funds the University of California, Berkeley
              as part of a multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
              (I/UCRC) for Power Systems Engineering (PSERC).  The I/UCRC involves 10
              university research sites generating over $1.5 million.  The four universities,
              Cornell University, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the University of
              Illinois-Champaign, and the University of California-Berkeley, being addressed
              in identical proposals as a group have generated over $600,000  in the last
              year. 

The Center addresses research projects in marketing, transmission and
              distribution and systems in electric power generation and transmission.
