Abstract    :
              The primary objective is to update and expand the Global Historical Climate
              Network (GHCN) database, focused on the high-mountain areas of Central Asia.
              The data set will be compiled from meteorological measurements conducted by the
              National Hydrometeorological Services (NHMS) of the Central Asian states in the
              Former Soviet Union. The goal is to extend the time series of 40 climate
              stations from Central Asia that are currently in the GHCN database, and add 200
              stations to that data set. Most of the new stations are located above the 1000m
              elevation. Monthly mean data for air temperature and cumulative monthly
              precipitation values collected by NHMS, along with a subset of maximum/minimum
              monthly temperature data will be constructed. The database will include three
              different data sets: (i) the original data; (ii) a homogeneity-adjusted data
              set that has undergone rigorous quality assessment and control; and (iii)
              station metadata. The data set will be archived at the National Snow and Ice
              Data Center (NSIDC), National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and
              National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). The work is important because it will
              result in a climate database useful to assess long-term climate in a region
              known to be a sensitive indicator of climate change.
