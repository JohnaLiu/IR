Abstract    :
              This research examines the health impact of the Wari empire (AD 600 - 1000) on
              populations in the state's heartland and periphery through paleopathological,
              dietary, and demographic analyses of archaeological human remains. The Wari
              state originated in the central Andean highlands (near modern-day Ayacucho) and
              incorporated populations throughout the Andes, including those of the Majes
              valley in south-central Peru.  Demographic, paleopathological, and stable
              isotopic bone composition data are collected from three archaeological skeletal
              samples-two from the peripheral Majes valley (sites, La Real and Beringa) and
              one from the heartland urban Wari site in the Ayacucho valley, Conchopata-to
              document past rural and urban community health during the period of the Wari
              rule.  These data are then used to compare differences in health status, if
              any, between those in the heartland and periphery, as well as document
              (dis)similarities between the two peripheral Majes valley skeletal populations
              that experienced interaction with Wari.  Finally, data on sex- and class-based
              health and dietary differences are used to consider past social and gender
              roles and organization.
