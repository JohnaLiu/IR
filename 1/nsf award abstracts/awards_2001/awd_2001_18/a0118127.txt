Abstract    :
              Smethie

In collaboration with a previously funded program by Pickart (WHOI),
              the PIs will contribute
to the identification of the origin of Classical
              Labrador Sea Water (CLSW) in the Irminger 
Basin, map the pathways of CLSW,
              Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW), and 
Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water
              (ISOW) IN THE Irminger Basin, estimate the rate of
DSOW flow to the Irminger
              Basin, and document variations of DSOW and ISOW in the 
Irminger Basin and the
              source of these variations.  They will use, primarily, CFC-11, -12, 
and -113.
               They will perform inverse modeling to understand diapycnal mixing in the Deep
              
Western Boundary Current and controls on how the overflow water mixes with
              and entrains
surrounding waters.
