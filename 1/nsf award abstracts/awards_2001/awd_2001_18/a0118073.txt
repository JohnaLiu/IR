Abstract    :
              This work is proposed as a starter grant to support a follow-on effort to
              PFSIVIETE fellowship
grant number 9896381, "A Longitudinal Study of Eight
              Engineering Colleges using the
SUCCEED Longitudinal Database." The primary
              goal of the original fellowship was to prioritize
factors that contribute to
              engineering student success by studying programs designed to help
engineering
              students at nine institutions. The breadth of data required to conduct such an
              analysis
could not be collected within the fellowship tenure, so this greater
              goal remains a subject for
continuing research. During the fellowship tenure,
              a number of individual studies were
completed, and results from these have
              been published or are being developed in collaboration
with the investigators
              who originally designed and implemented the programs under study. This
request
              asks for support necessary to complete the study of data already collected and
              to collect
additional data needed to begin to address the more aggressive goal
              of characterizing factors that
contribute to engineering student success. The
              Southeastern University and College Coalition for
Engineering Education
              (SUCCEED) will continue to significantly leverage this work.
