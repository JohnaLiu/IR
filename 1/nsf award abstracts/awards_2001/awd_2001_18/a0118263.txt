This funding is for a 3-week workshop titled
              "Structure Formation and Dark Matter: Theory vs. Observations." The Elementary
              Particles and Field Theory Group of Los Alamos National Laboratories and the
              Cosmology Group at the University of Chicago are coordinating the workshop. The
              workshop is designed to promote discussion through both formal and informal
              talks. The funds for this grant will be used to support travel expenses for
              approximately six students, thus enhancing their training in the field of
              Cosmology.

Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for
              Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).
