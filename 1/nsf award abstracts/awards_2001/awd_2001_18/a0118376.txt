Abstract: Water Distribution
              Infrastructure Management System: an Analytical Decision-Making Framework for
              the Planning of Rehabilitation Integrating Statistical failure Models

The
              overall objective of this research is to enrich the state of decision-making as
              it applies to water pipes assets management and rehabilitation programs.   The
              essential questions are: (1) what actions should be taken to ensure that the
              physical assets are managed in a cost efficient way? (2) when should such
              actions be taken?  

The proposed research expands upon the current studies
              conducted at Polytechnic University's Urban Infrastructure Institute (UII) in
              cooperation with European research centers.  It will focus on the evaluation of
              degradation models, and on the development of an analytical framework for risk
              management using New York City as a case study.
