Abstract    :
              The proposal requests travel expenses for US researchers to participate in a
              DELOS workshop on "Personalisation and Recommender Systems in Digital
              Libraries" to be held at Dublin City University in Dublin, Ireland June 18-20,
              2001.  DELOS is a major forum for and organizer of digital libraries research
              and planning activities in Europe.  It is funded by Information Societies
              Technologies (IST) 5th Framework Programme of the European Commission.  This
              proposal seeks travel support for six participants from the American research
              community.

The workshop continues the planning and research agenda put
              forward by the multi-year NSF-EU working groups' process jointly sponsored by
              CISE/IIS, SBE/INT and the European Union.  In the groups' final report "An
              International Research Agenda for Digital Libraries", increased levels of
              collaboration and interaction was seen as critical to building multi-lingual,
              multi-national digital libraries.
