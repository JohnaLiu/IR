This proposal is a continuation of the NSF-supported (award
              9631587) program at Duke University in which students design and build custom
              projects for people with disabilities. The objectives of the design projects
              are to enhance engineering education, provide students with insight into
              careers in rehabilitation, improve the quality of life of people with
              disabilities, and serve the  community. These projects will address special
              needs not met by commercial devices. 

The program will comprise a course,
              summer support of student interns, and follow-up service for projects already
              delivered. During the past five years the course was offered only in the fall
              semester; however, because of increasing student interest, now it is to be
              offered in both fall and spring semesters. The expanded program will allow
              approximately ten projects to be completed each year. 

Students will
              undertake a real-world design as they develop assistive, recreational, and
              therapeutic devices for people with disabilities. A health care professional
              familiar with the client will meet regularly with the student design team to
              insure that the project meets the client's needs. In addition to this capstone
              design experience, the course will provide students with exposure to
              engineering design procedures and ethics, and the overall program will help
              establish and strengthen ties between the university and the local community.
