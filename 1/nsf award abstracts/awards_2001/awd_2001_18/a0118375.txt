Abstract    :
              Following advances in information and communication technologies and the rapid
              evolution of E-Commerce and financial engineering during the past few years,
              optimization has begun to play a crucial role in sharpening the competitive
              edge of conventional business and organization operations.  Because of the
              expected growth in many information related areas and what is perceived as a
              critical demand for focused research attention on future directions and
              applications of large scale simulation optimization, a workshop will be
              organized at Harvard University on June 23 and 24, 2001.  This workshop will
              bring together leading government, industrial, and academic researchers and
              practitioners of systems simulation modeling and optimization for the purpose
              of identifying research issues, targets of opportunity, application areas and
              other unforeseen points relevant to this promising research area.
