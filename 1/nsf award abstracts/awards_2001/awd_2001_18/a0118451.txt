Abstract    :
              This award provides continued support of the Foundation's long-term commitment
              for the American National Election Studies (ANES) as a major data gathering and
              archiving resource.  The major purpose of ANES is to sustain and enhance the
              diversified database that supports basic research on voting, public opinion,
              and political participation in the United States.  The importance of the
              project derives from the significance of these topics.  Voting, public opinion,
              and participation are essential elements in the grand and complex story of
              politics and citizenship.  Over the last twenty-five years, ANES has
              successfully provided the empirical and conceptual foundations for research
              that has deepened an understanding of the part that Americans play in this
              process. Thousands of scholars have used the ANES database.

This project
              involves a continuation of the American National Election Studies.   The
              investigators carry out a 2004 study of a national probability sample of 1200
              individuals interviewed in the pre-presidential election period.  Approximately
              eighty five percent of those respondents are re-interviewed in the
              post-election period.  Both interviews last 50 minutes each on average and all
              are carried out face-to-face.  All data are made available quickly via a Web
              site and via the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research.
               A Board of Overseers, consisting of outstanding scholars from the electoral
              research community, advises the principal investigators and serves as
              representatives of the larger community of users of the ANES data.  There are
              opportunities for the diverse national social science community to participate
              directly in the design and execution of ANES studies.  There are resources for
              improving the quality of the core ANES time-series data and for testing
              innovations in theory, measurement, and data collection.

This research
              constitutes the most important database for the study of American politics and
              American political behavior.
