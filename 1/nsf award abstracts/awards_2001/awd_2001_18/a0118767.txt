Abstract    :
              This project extends peer-to-peer communication networks to better support
              formation of virtual communities in wide area computer networks. Virtual
              communities bring together individuals with similar interests, but the
              difficulty of forming them and sustaining critical mass discourages communities
              that serve small populations or compete with existing communities. Large-scale
              peer-to-peer networks offer the possibility of self-organizing communities, in
              which nodes recognize and create relatively stable connections to other nodes
              with similar interests. The solution includes nodes that learn about their
              network neighborhoods, nodes that offer partial (and competing) directory
              services, new methods of routing messages efficiently in peer-to-peer networks,
              more accurate methods of making resource selection decisions in environments
              containing many resources, and a utility-theoretic model for decision-making by
              individual nodes that incorporate multiple task requirements (e.g., cost,
              accuracy, and reliability). The scientific results will be more robust and
              efficient peer-to-peer networks, new techniques for forming virtual
              communities, and a better understanding of how complex peer-to-peer networks
              work. A software simulator will enable CS, MIS, and Business students to study
              virtual communities, for example testing hypotheses about why marketplaces fail
              or policies that encourage community formation. The basic science can be used
              to build search tools that explicitly consider tens of thousands of databases,
              software that supports dynamic creation of virtual communities within
              organizational intranets in response to unforeseen developments (e.g., the
              DoD), and wireless networks in which devices work whenever they are in range of
              another device.
