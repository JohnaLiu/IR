Abstract    :
              	
	The project "Design Parameterization for CHD-Based Mechanism Optimization",
              is studying how product solid models can be parameterized following a
              systematic approach to capture design intents in multiple CAD systems and
              determine if an accurate and efficient design sensitivity analysis can be
              developed that supports CAD-based mechanism optimization for industrial
              applications.
