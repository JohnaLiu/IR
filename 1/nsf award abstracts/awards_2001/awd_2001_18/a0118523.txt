This action supports the Third International Symposium on
              Structural Intermetallics (ISSI-3), a major international conference that is
              held once every four years. These funds are used to facilitate the
              participation of young investigators (students, post-doctoral fellows and young
              faculty) and to maintain reasonable registration fees for all participants. The
              symposium will be held from September 23 - 27, 2001 at the Snow King Resort in
              Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The 2001 ISSI-3 symposium has a strong emphasis on the
              role that affordability, reliability and design play in developing new
              materials for use in aerospace applications. Invited and contributed
              presentations will outline the design and business constraints associated with
              the introduction of new materials, address reliability and performance issues
              specific to intermetallic alloys, and highlight recent advances in the
              understanding of processing-structure-property relations in intermetallic
              alloys.

This meeting provides a forum in which engineering designers
              interact with materials and process engineers. ISSI-3 builds on the past
              success of previous ISSI conferences that were attended by over 200
              participants from approximately 19 countries and received extremely high
              satisfaction ratings.
