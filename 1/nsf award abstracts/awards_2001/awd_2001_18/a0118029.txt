The PI hypothesizes that river plume conditions at the river
              mouth control the angle of impact at the stagnation point, which then controls
              the split of waters that flow into the downstream coastal current and the bulge
              associated with the outflow plume.  Laboratory experiments, complemented by
              numerical modeling, is proposed.  Questions to be answered include: Are river
              plumes inherently time dependent?  How do river mouth parameters affect
              alongshore and cross-shore transport?  Is the assumption of a geostrophic
              balance in the coastal current uniformly valid?  The studies will define the
              structure of he plume, the stagnation point, and the coastal current, and
              describe the transport field within the coastal current.  Five lab cases
              include a standard, low inflow angle, high Rossby number, high Froude number,
              and non-zero bottom slope situations.  Reproducibility of the lab runs allows
              data from multiple runs (at least for the first 7-10 rotations) to be combined
              for analysis.
