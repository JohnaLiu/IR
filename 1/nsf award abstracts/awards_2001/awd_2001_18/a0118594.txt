This award supports a planning visit for PIs Kate Miller,
              University of Texas at El Paso
and Lincoln Hollister, Princeton University to
              travel to the Kingdom of Bhutan.  Their research goals require that they first
              visit the country where they will work with Bhutanese geoscientists to deploy a
              seismic network in Bhutan.  They will also train scientists at the Bhutanese
              Geological Survey (BGS) in modern seismic monitoring techniques.  Once they
              have finalized this work, they will prepare a full proposal for submission to
              the Geosciences research directorate. 

This activity will initiate seismic
              studies in a unique and previously inaccessible region of the Himalayas and
              will enhance current seismic research on the Himalayan region.  Collaboration
              and training of Bhutanese scientists in seismic hazard assessment will
              constitute the first steps toward establishing a national seismic monitoring
              network in a region with significant seismic hazard.
