Abstract    :
              For many recent applications, the concept of a data stream, possibly infinite,
              is more appropriate than a data set. By nature, a stored data set is
              appropriate when significant portions of the data are queried again and again,
              and updates are small and/or relatively infrequent. In contrast, a data stream
              is appropriate when the data is changing constantly (often exclusively through
              insertions of new elements), and it is either unnecessary or impractical to
              operate on large portions of the data multiple times. The goal of this research
              project is to develop models and techniques for the management and processing
              of data streams. Sampling, summarization, and online approximation algorithms
              will be employed to facilitate query processing and data mining over streams.
              The results of this project will provide efficient data stream techniques for
              data management, memory management, query processing, data mining, and data
              analysis. In addition, a software prototype will be developed for
              experimentation with algorithms and query processing, and as a testbed for some
              sample applications of significant scope, such as networking monitoring and
              traffic engineering, and medical monitoring data.
