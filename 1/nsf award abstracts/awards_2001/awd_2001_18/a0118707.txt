This project focuses on understanding the interactions of
              the Arctic Ocean outflow waters and Nordic Sea waters as they create the
              Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW) and the Iceland-Scotland Overflow water
              (ISOW) on the one hand and the Arctic Ocean influenced layers in the Nordic
              Seas on the other. Specific goals include: (1) determining the sources and
              pathways of fresh water out of the Arctic Ocean and studying the processes
              modifying downstream water masses; (2) determining the sources and
              characteristics of intermediate and deep waters of Arctic origin and their
              subsequent modification as they are exported in the Nordic Seas and North
              Atlantic Ocean; and (3) determining the pathways of Atlantic water through the
              Nordic Seas and into the Arctic Ocean and how it transforms Nordic Seas water
              masses. This new synoptic survey of the Nordic Seas will provide a baseline
              observation to understand the links between the various ocean basins in the
              region. This project is collaborative with Swedish scientists and is a
              contribution to the Climate variability and predictability program (CLIVAR).
