This Americas Program award will support a workshop
              organized by Dr. Charles M. Gray, Montana State University, and Dr. Pedro E.
              Maldonado of the University of Chile, to be held in Pucon, Chile in March 2002.
               The workshop will focus on the theoretical and experimental foundations of
              cooperative cortical dynamics with the goal of discussing different and
              complementary approaches to improve our understanding of brain
              function.

Participants will discuss theoretical and empirical approaches to
              characterizing and modeling neuronal activity in different structures of the
              nervous system, using a variety of methods ranging from electrophysiological
              techniques for the recording of large numbers of neurons to the mathematical
              analysis of spike trains.  An added benefit of this activity will be the
              introduction of advances in systems neuroscience and techniques employed to
              examine cortical function to students from the U.S. and throughout Latin
              America.
