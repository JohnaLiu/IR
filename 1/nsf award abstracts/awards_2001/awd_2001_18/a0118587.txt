This award will support Dr. William I. Rose, Michigan
              Technological University, in a collaboration with Dr. Eddie Sanchez Bennet,
              General Director, Instituto Nacional de Sismologia, Guatemala, and Dr. Carlos
              Pullinger, Instituto de Investigacion de Riesgos Naturales, San Salvador, for a
              study of volcanic hazard mitigation efforts in those countries, which are part 
              of the second most consistently active volcano zone on earth.   Many of those
              volcanoes are close to population centers, and this proposal will focus on
              specific research problems addressing areas with high risk such as
              those.

The researchers plan to address mitigation by the use of satellite
              remote sensing and kinematic GPS survey techniques along with digital
              topography, conventional field mapping, and laboratory simulation of volcanic
              processes. Through these methods they plan to develop a model of current and
              prospective hazards to be used to delineate changing hazard.
