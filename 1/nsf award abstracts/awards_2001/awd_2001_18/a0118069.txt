Abstract    :
              On January 17, 2001, a medium size oil spill hit the Galapagos islands, Ecuador,
              a Natural World Heritage site. Although few animals were killed immediately,
              there is strong concern about the long-term impacts on the endemic wildlife.
              Long-lived species, like the marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) in
              particular, offer ideal model systems to study potential chronic effects of
              environmental pollution. Marine iguanas forage on intertidal algae and are
              therefore highly exposed to water-borne pollutants. I have 14 years of
              physiological and demographic data for the marine iguana population most
              strongly affected, on Santa Fe island. Furthermore, as part of my most recent
              field project, I collected baseline data on environmental stress (plasma
              corticosterone levels), algae quality and digestive endosymbionts up to two
              days before the oil spill (Jan 17, 2001). Ample pre-oil spill data are also
              available for El Nino, La Nina and 'regular' seasons. To quantify the impacts
              of oiling I propose to measure the following parameters immediately, 3 months,
              6 months and 9 months after the spill: i) baseline and stress-induced
              corticosterone levels, ii) blood cell counts, iii) activity of hindgut
              endosymbiontic microbes, iv) standing algae crop, and v) survival rates of
              individually marked animals. Furthermore, an Ecuadorian assistant will conduct
              an experiment simulating an oil spill on captive marine iguanas at the Charles
              Darwin Research Station. This experiment will also allow us to test the
              feasibility of re-inoculating the hindgut of oiled marine iguanas with microbes
              from unaffected conspecifics. My detailed pre-spill data will allow me to
              quantify behavioral and physiological consequences of a severe environmental
              perturbation. These data will be immensely important for conservation and
              policy measures in Galapagos but will also be scientifically useful for global
              conservation issues.
