Abstract    :
              This project proposed by the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) will
              collect and
analyze data from sample surveys and data systems towards three
              goals: (1) evaluate the quality of initial
preparation and professional
              development of math and science teachers in the nation and by state,
              and
assess trends toward improved preparation, (2) assess change in the
              quality of teaching practices being
used in schools in relation to science and
              math education standards, and (3) establish a web-based system
for collecting
              data and evaluating the quality of professional development activities with
              science and
math teachers, using criteria based on recent research on quality
              programs. This  will be led by CCSSO with assistance from an expert panel, and
              a subcontractor organization, Wisconsin Center for Education Research (WCER).
