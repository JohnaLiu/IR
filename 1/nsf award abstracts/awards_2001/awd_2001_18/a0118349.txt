              ABSTRACT

OCE-0118349

The Cariaco Basin is a 1,400-m deep depression on the
              continental shelf off Venezuela in which anoxic waters cover laminated
              sediments with high organic matter content (1-5 wt%). These laminae,  which
              result from seasonal variations in primary productivity and terrigenous
              sediment input along the  southern the Caribbean Sea, contain a high-resolution
              record of past climate change in the tropical  Atlantic Ocean. In this
              collaborative effort, researchers at the University of South Florida  (USF),
              the University of South Carolina (USC), and the State University of New York
              (SUNY) seek to  integrate hydrographic, primary productivity, water column
              microbial activity, vertical particulate flux,  and sediment accumulation rate
              measurements in the Cariaco Basin into a synthesis to  understand how
              contemporary sedimentation patterns reflect this climatic and oceanographic
              variability.  The central objective is to understand the factors that control
              the relationship between primary  production and the vertical flux of particles
              in the Cariaco Basin. 

This project will continue the current time series of
              monthly observations at  10'30' N, 64'40' W that began in November, 1995, under
              the CARIACO (CArbon Retention In A  Colored Ocean) Program. This includes
              continuing deployment of a mooring with four sediment traps  (275, 350, 450,
              and 1,200 m) to provide bi-weekly sample collections at each depth.
              Complementing the traps will be a mooring with two Acoustic Doppler Current
              Profilers (ADCP), one looking up and the  other looking down from a depth of
              about 250 m, to measure currents from below the sill depth to the  surface for
              a three-year period.  Each year, one transect will be conducted between the
              CARIACO station  and 11'40' N, 64'40' W outside the basin, to help understand
              the characteristics of source water  involved in intrusions and upwelling.
              Regional wind and sea level will be examined using both local and 
              remotely-sensed data to establish whether forcing for upwelling occurs
              primarily through local or gyre-scale  processes.  Sediments from the Cariaco
              basin will be collected and analyzed to reconstruct the  oceanographic
              condition in the Cariaco Basin over the past century and provide a window for
              longer-scale  paleoceanographic studies. The program is significant because it
              provides groundtruthing needed for proper interpretation of past climate
              changes recorded in the Cariaco sediments.
