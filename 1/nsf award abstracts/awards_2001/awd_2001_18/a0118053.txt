The objective of the proposed research is to develop
              biophotonic markers for fluorescent biosensors that are smaller, brighter, less
              fragile, and more practical than existing markers.   The specific components of
              this research include: (1) an examination of the time dynamics of emission,
              photostability, and bleaching under a variety of incident excitation
              intensities, in the UV, visible, and near-infrared range of frequencies, (2) an
              examination of the solubility of particles and their integrity of brightness
              under diverse environmental conditions, such as those encountered in vivo, and
              (3) the development of cladding methods to improve biocompatibility, (4)
              develop methods to refine synthesis and scale the throughput to meet
              high-demand commercial applications, and (5) examine the feasibility of
              modifying the particles by attaching additional molecules to their surfaces to
              produce "smart" particles that are able to seek out specific biological
              targets, for imaging, targeted drug delivery, or destruction of a pathogenic
              invader.
