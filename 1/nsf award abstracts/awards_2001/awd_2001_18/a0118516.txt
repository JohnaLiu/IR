              ABSTRACT

PI: Michael Nikolaou and Brian McMillan 
Institution: University of
              Houston
Proposal Number: 0118516

Increasing functionality and wafer sizes
              are challenging integrated circuit manufacturing practices that rely on the
              execution of open-loop recipes.  To ensure high yields, reliable sensor-based
              methods for the prevention, detection and correction (control) of abnormal
              situations are gradually being used and need to be further developed.  To that
              end, this four-month GOALI project will serve to catalyze interaction between
              the microelectronics industry and the University of Houston, providing
              important input to the PI's future work in the area.

The work will be
              conducted at Lam Research Corporation's facilities and will focus on plasma
              etching.  Two commercial software products will be used to determine the
              potential for yield improvements on the basis of prevention, detection, and
              correction (control) methods that use data provided by sensors in existing
              tools.  The limits of software-based methods will be examined, and promising
              directions will be outlined for short and long-term development of sensor,
              monitoring, and control systems for plasma etching yield improvements. 
              Continuation of this work will be further pursued after the PI returns to his
              academic position.
