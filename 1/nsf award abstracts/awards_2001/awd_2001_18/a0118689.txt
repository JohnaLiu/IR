Abstract    :
              The International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) Working Group on
              Women in Physics is undertaking an international benchmarking effort to learn
              about the status and trends relating to women in physics internationally and it
              is organizing an International Conference on Women in Physics to be held in
              Paris, France in March 2002.  Funds from the National Science Foundation will
              support part of the benchmarking effort, the analysis and publication of its
              results, the participation of US physicists - especially students and
              early-career physicists - in the conference, the publication and dissemination
              of the conference proceedings and action plan, and some follow up.  These NSF
              funds will be supplemented by other grants and in-kind contributions from other
              Federal agencies, scientific organizations, international sources, and
              industry.  Essentially this same proposal is being sent to the US Department of
              Energy (DOE) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), with
              complementary but not overlapping budget requests.  The National Academy of
              Sciences has already committed to provide $25K in general, unrestricted
              support, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
              committed $10K.
