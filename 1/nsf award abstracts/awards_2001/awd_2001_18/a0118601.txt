Abstract    :
              A workshop focused on international networking opportunities in materials
              research and education will be held in conjunction with the Seventh
              International Union of Materials Research Societies'lnternational Conference on
              Advanced Materials (RJURS-ICAM) in Cancun, Mexico, in August 2001. This
              conference provides a unique opportunity for materials scientists from around
              the world to present their latest discoveries and discuss their findings with
              colleagues. 

The conference participants will be able to take advantage of
              the specialized topical symposia while simultaneously meeting with potential
              collaborators through the networking workshop. The workshop is part of a
              broader effort to establish a global materials research network. It consists of
              a'collaboration fairin which linkages to create three global networks in the
              areas of materials education, materials for energy and for the environment will
              be developed.
