Abstract    :
              The proposal has been ranked high among the proposals reviewed at the Robotics
              panel. It received four written reviews, with ratings (E, V, V, V).  The
              project  addresses the problem of finding collision-free paths for an object,
              such as a robot, moving from point A to point B. New probabilistic roadmap
              heuristics will be developed and experimentally verified. To study the
              underlying problem and to verify developed strategies, a supporting
              visualization software will be developed. Another important part of the work
              focuses on education: it includes wide involvement in the project of
              undergraduate students, including travel to conferences to present their
              findings.
