Banded fibrous veins are common features in
              deformed rocks, and are classically interpreted to indicate operation of a
              crack-seal mechanism in which a crack event is immediately followed by a
              cement-precipitation event due to local pressure drop.  However, recent results
              of mass-balance considerations have cast doubt on this being a valad mechanism.
               This project will examine the question of the formation of banded veins from a
              new perspective model that includes two simplifying processes - pressure
              exerted by growing crystals and geochemical self-organization whereby a nearly
              constant fluid composition at the vein-host walls leads to oscillations in
              precipitated species.  A series of tests will be applied to veins sets using
              both geochemical/microthermometric data and textural information to understand
              chemical and mechanical processes responsible for these types of veins. 
              Results will help improve understanding of vein formation and therefore their
              use in understanding the tectonic setting in which they formed.
