     The investigator studies the effects of errors imposed
              by
numerical computations carried out in most applied environments
(e.g.
              commercial computers).  He focuses on rigorous control of
errors in the
              numerical solution of systems of ordinary
differential equations, particularly
              chaotic dynamical systems.
The goal is to provide accurate estimates of the
              errors of the
actual calculations, and to introduce an accurate means
              of
dealing with rounding/truncation errors.
     Auto-validating methods for
              the numerical solution of
mathematical problems or of mathematical models of
              science and
engineering problems, especially chaotic dynamical systems,
              is
becoming increasingly important.  Rigorous error estimates,
valuable for
              any computational model, are especially important in
chaotic systems, which
              arise in modeling weather, neural
networks, and so on.  The investigator
