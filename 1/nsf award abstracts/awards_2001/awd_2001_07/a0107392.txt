Abstract    :
              This award is for the partial support of travel of USA participants to the
              Symposium on Geometric Mechanics and Symmetry at the University of Warwick. The
              Symposium will focus on the symplectic and differential geometry of symmetric
              Hamiltonian systems and applications of geometry and symmetry techniques to the
              classical, semi-classical and quantum mechanics.
