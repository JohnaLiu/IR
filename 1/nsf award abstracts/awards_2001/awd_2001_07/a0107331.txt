The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide twelve months of support to Dr.
              David L. Savitt to work with Dr. Christophe Breuil at the Universite Paris-Sud
              in Orsay, France on the modularity of some geometric Galois recommendations. 
              This project is co-funded by the Math and Physical Science Directorate's Office
              of Multidisciplinary Activities.
This research is part of a program to
              investigate the following fundamental question of arithmetic algebraic
              geometry:  when can a representation of the absolute Galois group of the
              rational numbers be found in geometry?  For example, results in this direction
              were the crux of Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.
The arithmetic
              geometry group at Paris-Sud is one of the largest and most active in the world.
               In addition to Breuil, the faculty at Orsay includes, among others, Laurent
              Clozel, Jean-Louis Colliot-Thelene, Jean-Marc Fontaine, Guy Henniart, Luc
              Illusie, Laurent Lafforgue, Gerard Laumon, Bernadette Perrin-Riou, Michel
              Raynaud, and Lucien Szpiro. ***
