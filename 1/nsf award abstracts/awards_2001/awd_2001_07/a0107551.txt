Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2001.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Modeling the Effects of Hurricane and Fire Disturbances on the Population
              Dynamics of South Florida Slash Pine."  Fires and hurricanes are frequent
              disturbances affecting community structure and dynamics of pine forests in the
              southeastern US.  This research is developing spatially explicit,
              individual-based models of pine population dynamics, parameterized from
              empirical data that include hurricane and fire disturbances.  The models are to
              be used to predict how pine populations will respond to hypothetical
              disturbance regimes associated with global change.
