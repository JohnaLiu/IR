The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide twenty-four months of support to
              Dr. Andrea N. Lommen to do research with Dr. Michiel van der Klis at the
              University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Funding for this project is being
              provided by NSF's Math and Physical Sciences Directorate Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities.
For this project, Dr. Lommen will use the new
              capabilities of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) in Dwingeloo,
              the Netherlands, in conjunction with the x-ray expertise of the Astronomy
              Institute of the University of Amsterdam to undertake three new projects to
              study the emission mechanism in pulsars.  She will study the validity of
              Dispersion Measure as a widely used concept in Radio Astronomy, using the
              simultaneous multi-frequency capability of WSRT.  Second, she will measure
              off-pulse emission in a collection of slow and millisecond pulsars.  Third, she
              will use soon-to-be archival XMM and Chandra data, in conjunction with radio
              timing data at WSRT to perform absolute timing, and acquire phase resolved
              spectra of a number of x-ray emitting rotation powered pulsars.
Dr. van der
              Klis is one of the leading authorities in the field of pulsar research. 
              Westerbork is one of the world's premier radio telescope facilities.
