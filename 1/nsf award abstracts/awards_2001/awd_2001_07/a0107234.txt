Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for CoFE 2001 conference that will focus on
              identifying food engineering priorities for the 21st century and on integrating
              this field with other major engineering disciplines and promoting interaction
              among engineers from various engineering discipline areas. The Conference is
              designed to help guide future research priorities and is organized around the
              major topical tracks including: (1) physical chemistry of foods, (2) transport
              processes, (3) food processing and packaging, (4) food engineering education,
              and (5) university and industry interaction. This Conference will provide a
              forum for consideration of future research directions of food process
              engineering in critical need, especially those research challenges emerging
              from the food industry. This Conference will be the 8th one of its series. It
              will be a topical conference within the annual meeting of the American
              Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) to be held in Reno, Nevada during
              November 5 - 9, 2001. The organizing committee plans to submit a final report
              of the Conference to the National Science Foundation soon after the
              Conference.
