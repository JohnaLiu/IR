The main theme of this project is the study of
              three-manifolds 
and smooth four-manifolds by using gauge theory and
              symplectic geometry.  The Principal Investigator proposes to study and
              
further develop a recent construction that give invariants 
for closed
              oriented 3-manifolds and a related construction  
that give invariants for
              smooth closed oriented 4-manifolds. 
These constructions use handle
              decompositions and a version
of Lagrangian Floer-homology. The PI will also
              study 
applications of these new techniques in 3 and 4-manifold 
topology. In
              particular PI will study these invariants for three-manifolds that fiber over a
              circle and symplectic 
4-manifolds.

Gauge theory is a very important
              technique in smooth 
4-manifold theory.  It involves the theory of Donaldson
              
invariants and Seiberg-Witten invariants. These invariants 
are constructed
              by solving certain elliptic partial differential equations inspired by
              mathematical physics. Both constructions 
have ramifications for
              three-manifolds as well, these
are related to solving the partial differential
              equations 
over four-manifolds with a three-dimensional boundary. 
In
              addition to studying these invariants the Principal 
Investigator also
              proposes to study in detail a third 
construction that involves holomorphic
              disks and a 
decomposition of the manifold into elementary pieces.
