Abstract    :
              The next generation integrated circuit (IC) chips will contain nano-scale
              high-density interconnects with thousands of I/O pins. Due to the physical size
              of conventional needle probes, the existing probe method of characterizing and
              testing chips is no longer a viable technique as the number of I/Os increases.
              This project proposes to investigate the feasibility of using
              micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology to probe CMOS circuits on
              wafer level. This project focuses on (1) the development of high frequency
              electrical models of nano-scale on-chip interconnects and CMOS circuits, (2)
              the fabrication of a novel MEMS probe structure for testing high-density
              circuits, and (3) the demonstration of the MEMS probe structure to characterize
              circuits in nano-scale design.
