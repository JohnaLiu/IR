Abstract    :
              0107402  Christensen  The objective of this research project is to determine the
              fate and transport of organic pollutants in the aquatic environment based on
              receptor models and related methodologies.  The emphasis is on polychlorinated
              biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in dated sediment
              cores from lakes and rivers.  The sediment record offers a convenient means of
              evaluating not only the present situation but also past trends in
              physical/chemical and biological degradation, and the relative significance of
              the different sources.  Mathematical methods include factor analysis models
              which do not depend on preexisting knowledge of degradation or source profiles,
              and chemical mass balance models in which sources and the relative amounts of
              various compounds or source profiles must be known.  Both categories of
              pollutants are of concern to the environment and may be present both in point
              and non-point sources as well as in atmospheric fallout. ***
