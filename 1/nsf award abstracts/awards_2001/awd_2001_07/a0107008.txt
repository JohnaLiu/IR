Abstract    :
              This project examines some of the research methods currently in use for
              educational research projects and produce a series of reports and publications
              on the Design Experiment method that was developed by Ann Brown.  The
              researchers would host meetings, develop an online graduate course, and
              dedicate a web site to the purpose of explicating the design experiment
              methodology and characterize its power and limitations for making claims.  This
              research method has gained wide support among some education researchers and
              yet the method itself is interpreted differently by those using it.  The
              purpose of this project is to clarify and provide a basis for informed use of
              the method in the future.
