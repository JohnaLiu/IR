Abstract    :
              The investigator proposes to continue the development of efficient and accurate
              numerical methods for unsteady incompressible flow, with particular emphasis on
              (i) finding new equivalent formulations of Navier-Stokes equations, often
              inspired by physical considerations, better suited to numerical computation;
              (ii) proper handling of boundary conditions, a key difficulty in the subject
              since important physical interactions frequently occur near the boundary; (iii)
              rapid computation of three dimensional flows and generalization of schemes for
              flows in complex geometries; (iv) development of efficient schemes for complex
              fluids such as magneto-hydrodynamics, liquid crystal polymers, geodynamo,
              climate modeling, and large eddy turbulence simulations; (v) design of
              numerical schemes that preserves numerically conserved quantities such as
              energy and helicity for inviscid flow, and accurately captures their
              dissipation rates at high Reynolds number.  It is widely believed that
              different dissipation rates for energy and helicity is the key mechanism
              leading to the formation of large coherent structures of turbulent
              flows.

The numerical simulation of incompressible flows, which plays an
              important role in numerous scientific and industrial applications of current
              interest, is a challenging task for both numerical analysts and computational
              fluid dynamicists.  The proposed fast and accurate numerical methods for
              incompressible flow is expected to become an important tool for simulation and
              analysis of complex turbulent flow phenomena including vortex breakdown,
              (massive) flow separation, vortex shedding, transient jets in cross-stream,
              wake-body interaction, high-swirl flow, etc.  It is also an essential tool for
              the design of advanced flow control mechanisms used, for example, to reduce
              flow-induced noise and vibration, and to improve lift/drag performance at
              reduced energy consumption rates.  Examples include flow over bluff bodies such
              as ground or under-water vehicles; in engines; in/around rotating machinery or
              in data storage units with rotating and moving parts.
