Abstract    :
              The Federal Facilities Council (FFC) is an element of the Board on
              Infrastructure and the Constructed Environment (BICE) of the National Research
              Council.  Since 1953 the FFC and its predecessor organizations have provided
              its sponsoring agencies with a mechanism for jointly identifying and addressing
              mutual problems and concerns in the areas of building science and technology,
              management, and operations. Each year, the FFC formulates a Technical
              Activities Program to address the major concerns of the sponsor agencies. The
              2001 Activities Program includes the following activities: initiation of an NRC
              advisory study of Capital Project Investment Decisions; information studies and
              workshops to address Performance Based Condition Assessments, Best Practices
              for Facility Advance Planning, Best Practices for Achieving Healthy Indoor
              Environments, and  a Compendium of Best Practices for Facility Operations and
              Maintenance; conferences on Post-Occupancy Evaluations (POEs) for Facilities,
              Outsourcing of Management Functions for the Acquisition of Federal Facilities,
              and Emerging Technologies for Buildings of the 21st Century. The FFC program
              also supports approximately 35 meetings of FFC standing committee and
              maintenance of the FFC Internet Home Page. Reports resulting from the FFC
              program are prepared in sufficient quantity to ensure their distribution to the
              sponsors and to other relevant parties and made available electronically
              through the internet.
