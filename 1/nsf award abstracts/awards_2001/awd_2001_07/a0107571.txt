Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2001.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Dynamic species interactions, uncertainty and the maintenance of ecosystem
              robustness."  The interplay between community complexity and stability is the
              source of one of the classic debates in ecology.  Heterogeneous spatial and
              temporal species distributions and trophic interactions, though central to the
              debate, have been studied little.  To address these issues this research
              develops new computational methods to parameterize, simulate, and analyze a
              multi-species, multi-patch model.
