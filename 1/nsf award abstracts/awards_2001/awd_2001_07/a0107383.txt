The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will support a twenty-four month postdoctoral
              research fellowship for Dr. Erich Graf to work with Dr. Martin Lages at the
              University of Glasgow in Scotland.

The perception of motion is one of the
              most important features of low-level information processing shared with all
              seeing creatures.  While tremendous advancements in our understanding of motion
              processing in the cortex have occurred in the past decades, many issues are
              left unresolved.  One issue concerns the location along the processing pathway
              where the integration of binocular motion information occurs.  The work
              proposed uses psychophysical and computational approaches to attempt to find an
              answer.  The PI and his host will use the results obtained from their
              investigations as well as other relevant motion literature to extend simulation
              studies of single cell responses to populations of binocular simple and complex
              cells using new algorithms inspired by analogous work in the field of
              audition.

The Department of Psychology at the University of Glasgow has an
              ideal group of researchers who will work with Dr. Graf on this project.  They
              include researchers in the areas of ophthalmology, psychophysics and
              computational vision.
