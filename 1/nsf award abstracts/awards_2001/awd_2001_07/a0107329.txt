The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide twenty-four months of support to
              Dr. Andrew T. Metters to work with Dr. Jeffrey Hubbell at the Swiss Federal
              Institute of Technology (ETH) and University of Zurich in Switzerland on
              engineered polymeric biomaterials for enhancement of cell migration and nerve
              regeneration.
Novel, biomaterials that guide cell growth and migration offer
              great potential as scaffolds for the engineering of complex tissues.  This
              research involves tailoring the three-dimensional architectures of
              enzymatically degradable, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-co-peptide hydrogels. 
              These specialized networks actively promote regeneration of peripheral nerves
              through their unique combination of chemical and structural parameters.
Dr.
              Hubbell heads a research group at ETH that consists of approximately 30
              doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows and senior researchers with
              multidisciplinary backgrounds.  The institute contains state-of-the-art
              research equipment for peptide synthesis, polymer chemistry analysis,
              microscopy, cell culture, and biochemical analysis.
