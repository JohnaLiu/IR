Abstract    :
              This project is intended to examine statistical data bases for the cities of
              Miami and Detroit to apply a statistical model of teacher hiring practices to
              seek improved strategies for attracting high quality teachers.  It would focus
              on determining leverage points for maintaining a high quality instructional
              work force, providing the basis for selecting a policy from among options of
              changing wage compensation, working conditions, or district policies.  The team
              will use econometric analysis and dynamic-system modeling.  Teacher turnover
              will be analyzed with a statistical model that includes teacher attributes,
              compensation, and school factors.  Then school effects will be decomposed into
              specific attributes that affect turnover and measurable attributes that can be
              observed.  Finally, the researchers will build a data set that links teachers
              to students to examine the effect of teacher attributes to student outcomes.
