This proposal is being recommended as a Small Grant
              for Exploratory Research (SGER) to develop new sampling and measurement methods
              and tools that can be deployed under the Arctic Ocean ice cap for a joint U.S.
              - German expedition to the Gakkel Ridge in August/September 2001.  The current
              methods, such as dredging, may not be successful in ice-covered waters, so the
              Principal Investigator is proposing to design, test and build a new rock
              sampler.  He is also proposing to retrofit a hydrothermal monitor, known as the
              miniature autonomous plume recorder (MAPR).  The MAPR was developed by the
              Pacific Marine Environmental Lab to increase opportunities or collecting
              hydrothermal plume data along mid-ocean ridge and volcanic systems.

This
              proposal is appropriate for consideration under the SGER program because the
              rock sampler has not been developed.  Neither the rock sampler nor the
              retrofitted plume recorder have ever been tested under ice.  Therefore, the
              instruments meet the SGER criterion, "preliminary work on untested and novel
              idea." If one or all of the instruments perform successfully under ice, then
              the Arctic program will have several new and inexpensive sampling
              devises.
