Abstract    :
              The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry (IBO) program of the
              Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, supports Dr. Hilary Godwin
              (as PI)and Dr. Brian Hoffman (as co-PI) of the Department of Chemistry,
              Northwestern University, and Dr. Kristin Bowman-James (as co-PI)of the
              Department of Chemistry, University of Kansas, for the organization of the
              Workshop "Frontiers of Inorganic Chemistry" to be held September 2001 at Copper
              Mountain, Colorado. 

The Workshop will bring together experts from the
              various sub-disciplines of Inorganic Chemistry and from the various schools
              across the country to address (i) what questions remain to be examined in the
              various fields of inorganic chemistry? (ii) what new frontiers in Inorganic
              Chemistry will likely emerge and require exploration in the medium to long
              term? (iii) how can inorganic chemistry help to fuel technological advances?
              and (iv) how can inorganic chemistry best balance the desire for specific
              scientific advances with the fundamental and ongoing needs for non-directed
              basic research?. A report will be issued from the Workshop that will be
              submitted to NSF and made available to the entire chemical community through
              the web.
