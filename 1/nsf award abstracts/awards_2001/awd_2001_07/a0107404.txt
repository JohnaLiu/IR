Abstract    :
              This grant will support and enhance the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) by
              developing several anthropogenic impact scenarios.  Scenarios will be developed
              to simulate large-scale impacts of urbanization and soil degradation, intended
              for use in CCSM.  Specific goals of the project include the development of new
              urban landuse classes for use in the CCSM's Land Surface Model (LSM).  Urban
              and suburban landuse class will be developed for LSM using parameters estimated
              from the urban climatology literature.  To simulate urban areas extent over
              time, the PIs will develop a population density database from 1750 to 2050.  A
              new 1 km resolution human population density database will be used along with
              past and future population estimates from UN and historical data sources. 
              Urban extent will then be estimated from population density maps.  In addition,
              the population density database will be used along with the UNEP/GRID soils
              degradation database to develop a time series of human impacts on soils from
              1750-2050.  This database will be used to alter soil water holding capacities
              over time in LSM and will be used to simulate the impacts of soil degradation
              on global scales.
