Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigator is a mathematician in the Department of Mathematics
              at the University of North Texas (UNT).  This grant will support the PI
              spending a year visiting the Institute of Applied Sciences (IAS) at UNT.  One
              objective is to establish a collaborative research program in quantitative
              environmental biology. Work will initially focus on developing and analyzing
              complex ecosystem models, and applying stochastic optimal control techniques to
              evaluate resource management strategies.  The PI will also serve as a
              mathematics consultant for the UNT Department of Biology.  This will help the
              PI develop a basic understanding of a wide range of biological research
              problems and so acquire necessary firsthand knowledge to direct the development
              of an interdisciplinary program in mathematical biology at the University of
              North Texas.  Student participation and community outreach will be important
              parts of the work.  Undergraduate and graduate mathematics students will be
              involved both in the ecosystem research and in the consulting projects. The PI
              will develop presentations including- three-dimensional computer
              visualizations- which illustrate results from the proposed work for the IAS
              public education center.  This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS
              Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical
              Sciences (DMS).
