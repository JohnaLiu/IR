     The goal of this project is to better understand
              the
relationship between dispersal rates and the
              spatio-temporal
heterogeneity of environments.  In particular, the
              investigator
would like to understand if there are any
              fundamental
relationships upon which a framework for this theory can
              be
developed.  Therefore, to minimize extraneous effects the
investigator
              continues to study what is perhaps the simplest
continuous model that
              explicitly incorporates a spatial variable:
a system of reaction diffusion
              equations with Lotka-Volterra
reaction terms, where the reaction term of each
              species is
identical, and where the birth rate is spatially and
              temporally
heterogeneous.  This model allows for a variety of
              perturbations
through which one can study the impact of various factors in
              the
evolution of dispersal rates.  Of course, this model has
              several
limitations.  The first is the assumption that leads to the
dispersal
              being represented as simple diffusion.  The investigator
wishes to understand
              the effects of taxis on the relationship
between dispersal rates and spatial
              heterogeneity.  On a more
general level the investigator intends to replace
              diffusion by an
integral kernel.
     That ecology and evolution are
              fundamentally influenced by
the spatial characteristics of the environment is
              well accepted.
As an example of this one may consider the paradox of
              diversity.
Simple mathematical models that do not include any
              spatial
component give rise to the principle of competitive exclusion:
when
              two species compete for the same limited resource one of the
species usually
              becomes extinct.  On the other hand it is commonly
observed that in a wide
              variety of habitats a multitude of
species coexist.  This can be explained, at
              least in part, by
including spatial effects.  Of course, once spatial
              components are
introduced, dispersal rates become a central
              feature.
Unfortunately, our understanding of cause and effect in this
              more
general situation is poor.  The reasons for this appears to be
fourfold.
               First, the number of variables in realistic ecological
and environmental
              models is enormous.  Second, spatial
heterogeneities occur at all scales of
              the environment.  Third,
obtaining precise data for these variables from field
              studies is
extremely difficult.  Finally, current mathematical techniques
              for
handling models that incorporate both spatial and dynamical
properties
              seem to be inadequate.  Given this state of affairs, a
simple model is
              thoroughly investigated in the hopes of
elucidating the basic biological
              principles and identifying the
fundamental mathematical issues.
