Abstract    :
              This research will describe the neural and cognitive components of learning by
              observing, producing, and by imitating physical representations in the human
              brain.  This will allow developing new learning tools and pedagogical
              approaches that may enhance education at all levels.  It will use functional
              magnetic resonance imaging of the brain to define the involvement of the
              observation/execution matching system in different aspects of learning by
              observation, production, and imitation.  Specifically, the research will:

-
              Describe mental representations underlying knowledge acquisition through
              representation, observation and imitation in neural and cognitive terms

- 
              Investigate the mechanisms of individual learning in relation to social and
              societal influences

-  The definition of psychological and physiological
              mechanisms of speech perception

The findings of this research are also
              relevant to brain development and the relation between cognitive skill and
              developmental strategies.
