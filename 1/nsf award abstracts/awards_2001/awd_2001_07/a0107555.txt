Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2001.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Estimating global microbial diversity:  A bioinformatics approach."  Scaling
              law, probability and combinatorial theory are being used to quantify
              biodiversity patterns across a wide range of spatial scales and at different
              levels of phylogenetic resolution.  Using computer intensive spatial
              statistical analyses and simulation modeling, hypotheses are being tested with
              a microbial genetic database two orders of magnitude larger than any previously
              reported (~73,000 16S rDNA clones collected over ~ 1 m2 to ~10,000 km2 in
              Australia, analyzed by RFLP and other sophisticated genetic techniques).
