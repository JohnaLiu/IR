Abstract    :
              The project provides the principal investigator (PI), an assistant professor of
              mathematics,  with academic training in biostatistics so that he (1) can
              develop a new career that will significantly help his home institution to
              achieve its strategic goals in science, (2)  can become a significant
              collaborator with and resource for his colleagues in the biological sciences,
              providing a unique mathematical perspective on significant biological questions
              and their statistical ramifications. The grant activity will enhance the
              teaching of statistics at the lower division undergraduate level as well as the
              possibility of  collaborative teaching of a biostatistics course in the upper
              division. To obtain the requisite training in biostatistics and life sciences
              generally, the applicant will spend one academic year as a visitor at the
              University of Minnesota School of Public Health in the Division of
              Biostatistics.  The grantee will take course work in biostatistics and the life
              sciences, participate in departmental seminars, and frame a program of research
               designed to complement the biological research of the Science Department at
              BHSU.  This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of 
              Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences
              (DMS).
