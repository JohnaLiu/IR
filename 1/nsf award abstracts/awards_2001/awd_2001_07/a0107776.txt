Globally, mycorrhizal fungi are likely to
              sequester a substantial amount of carbon in their living and dead tissues and
              through the production of recalcitrant compounds such as chitin and glomalin.
              Dr. Treseder and colleagues will test the hypothesis that increases in nitrogen
              availability in soils will reduce the immobilization of nutrients in this
              mycorrhizal material, because nitrogen additions may decrease mycorrhizal
              growth but increase death rates and decomposition of dead tissue. If this is
              the case, increasing nitrogen deposition could reduce soil carbon storage and
              accelerate the current rise in atmospheric CO2 levels. The investigators will
              employ field and laboratory techniques to assess the effects of nitrogen
              fertilization on mycorrhizal carbons. The findings will be evaluated in the
              context of potential interactions between nitrogen deposition and elevated
              atmospheric CO2, and with possible implications for natural and agricultural
              ecosystems
