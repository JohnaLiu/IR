This is a eighteen-month U.S.-Vietnam cooperative project
              between Dr. Hoang Pham, Rutgers University, and Dr. Thuy Bich Dong, the
              University of Natural Sciences, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, to study a two-stage
              general calibrating reliablity model for predicting software reliability under
              operating environments.  This research is important and addresses a key quality
              control problem in computer and information technology.  The inclusion of
              development process factors in software reliability models is a first important
              step in improving accuracy in telecommunication software.  The results of this
              study can have a wide variety of applications including use in computer and
              information technology and in control and automation systems.  This proposal
              addressess an important scientific question and meets the NSF focus area of
              human resource development.
