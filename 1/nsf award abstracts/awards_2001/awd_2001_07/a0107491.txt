Abstract    :
                     In diverse world regions such as the Americas, Europe and South 
Asia,
              free-market policies have forced small-scale farmers to transform 
their
              productive strategies or face economic ruin.  Peasant and 
small-farmer
              organizations that once were oriented almost exclusively 
toward
              national-level efforts to obtain local-level benefits are now 
increasingly
              seeking allies across national borders, attempting to affect 
global forces
              which impact their rural livelihoods.  In some cases this has 
resulted in
              violent actions such as the French peasants' destruction of a 
McDonalds
              restaurant in a protest against "fast food"; and Indian farmers 
burning a
              field of genetically modified cotton as a protest against 
agribusiness. This
              anthropological project studies a new international 
peasant and small farmer
              organization called Via Campesina, or Peasant 
Road, which was founded in 1993
              and has affiliates in about sixty 
countries.  The project will interview
              small farmer activists and donor NGO 
personnel in five sites: Brussels, the
              headquarters of the European peasant 
confederation; Saskatoon, Canada, where
              the network's Technical Secretariat 
is based; Tegucigalpa, Honduras,
              headquarters of the network's 
Organizational Secretariat; Managua, Nicaragua,
              the base of a Central 
American small farmers' network that helped found the
              Peasant Road; and 
Bangalore, India, home of one of the most active of the
              network's 
constituent organizations. In each site the interviews and analysis
              of 
documentary materials will focus on the political formation of activist
              individuals, the histories of 
organizational consolidation, and the
              mobilization of resources and 
alliances. The project will examine what
              movements defending economically 
marginal constituencies gain and lose by
              forming part of global civil 
society, as well as how new varieties of
              transnational politics have shaped 
peasant and small farmer identities, both
              within the agriculturist 
organizations and in relation to their NGO backers
              and antagonists. The new 
knowledge generated by this proposal will advance
              our understanding of how 
comparable grass-roots and global organizations
              function.
