Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2001.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Computer Simulations of Biological Molecules: Obtaining Unique Information on
              their Structure and Function from STM Images."  Novel methods and tools for
              computer simulations of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of
              biological molecules are being developed.  These methods are being used for
              obtaining unique information about structure, dynamics, and function of
              proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids from their STM images. The methods will
              also facilitate tailoring STM experiments.
