Abstract    :
              0107918  Plummer  The objective of this project is to evaluate the disinfecting
              capability of ultrasound for the inactivation of microorganisms in drinking
              water treatment, used alone and in conjunction with chlorination.  Specific
              microbes to be tested are E. coli and F-specific coliphages.  Chlorine has been
              chosen for this initial work because it is anticipated that sonication would
              have application at smaller drinking water treatment facilities that typically
              use chlorination for disinfection.  Lower chlorine demand with sonication is
              expected to reduce the formation of disinfection by-products.  Implementation
              of newer or more complicated disinfection technologies that reduce disinfection
              by-product formation, such as ozonation or UV radiation, may not be feasible
              for smaller drinking water utilities.  The research will first be conducted
              using a synthetic water with the two proposed organisms to study the
              disinfection effectiveness in the absence of particulate matter, organic matter
              and other microorganisms;  subsequent experiments will be conducted using
              Wachusett Reservoir water.   The results of this work are expected to provide a
              basis for improving the disinfection of drinking water, particularly in smaller
              drinking water utilities that require disinfection strategies that are both
              simple and effective. ***
