The formation
              and evolution of continental orogenic zones is one of the most fundamental yet
              poorly understood problems in geoscience. Among the various types of
              continental orogenic zones, the two that are most pervasive are those in the
              vicinity of a plate boundary such as the western North American orogenic zone,
              and those associated with continental rifting such as the 1.1 billion-year old
              Midcontinent rift (MCR) in the central United States.  The proposed study is
              aimed at improving our understanding about the formation and evolution of
              continental orogenic zones by using a unique broadband seismic data set that we
              recently recorded along an E-W profile across Kansas. We propose to locate and
              characterize the mantle transition between the Rocky Mountains and the Great
              Plains, and to explore the deep structure and possible fossil anisotropy
              beneath the MCR by apply various of seismological techniques to the broadband
              data set. We will also perform geodynamic modeling aiming at looking for a
              model that best explains the uplift history of the Rocky Mountains since the
              Laramide orogeny by using the seismic results as constraints.
