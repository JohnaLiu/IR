              Abstract



	Closely related sympatric species often differ in the way they
              use resources or escape their natural enemies.   These repeated differences can
              be attributed to two processes:  repeated character displacement or lineage
              assortment.   Feather lice (Insecta: Ischnocera), parasitic on birds, provide
              an opportunity to test for these two alternatives in a relatively diverse
              system that involves several host microhabitats related to parasite escape from
              host preening.  This research will construct a phylogeny of avian feather lice
              based on an integration of molecular and morphological data, including DNA
              sequences for one mitochondrial and three nuclear genes and nearly 6000 base
              pairs.  The phylogeny will permit a critical assessment of microhabitat
              specialization, the first such rigorous test in a host-parasite
              system.

	This host-parasite system of adaptations is of interest to
              population geneticists, systematists, and ecologists and has implications for
              understanding the origin of parasitic relationships of interest to medical and
              veterinary entomologists.  Integration of morphological and molecular data will
              support the first rigorous, modern concepts of feather lice phylogeny and form
              the basis for greatly improved and predictive classifications.
