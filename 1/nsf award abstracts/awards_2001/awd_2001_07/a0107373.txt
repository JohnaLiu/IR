The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will provide eighteen months of support to Dr.
              Stephen D. Jordan to do research with Dr. Pierre Taberlet at Universite Joseph
              Fourier in Grenoble, France.

This project will involve working on the
              molecular systematics and population genetics of goats.  The PI will use
              existing maps of the domestic goat genome to identify approximately 20 nuclear
              genes for sequencing in wold and domestic goats.  He will use the sequence data
              for two major purposes.  First he will generate a phylogenetic tree of all goat
              species relationships.  He will reconstruct the evolutionary history and look
              for molecular signatures indicative of goat hybridization between both wild and
              domestic species.  Second, he will use the same data set to search for genetic
              signatures of natural selection in goats.  This project will generate one of
              the largest data sets (in terms of genes sequenced) assembled for a molecular
              systematics study or to identify selection signatures.

Dr. Taberlet is a
              leader in studies of biogeography and intraspecific genetic variation.
