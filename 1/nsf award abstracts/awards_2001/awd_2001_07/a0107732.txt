Abstract    :
              Professor Jonathan L. Sessler in the Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry at
              the University of Texas at Austin is supported by the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies on novel polypyrrolic
              macrocycles that differ from naturally occurring tetrapyrrolic systems by
              virtue of being "pyrrole-inverted" or topographically non-planar.  The
              preparation of these new materials and the study of their basic chemical
              properties, including those associated with anion complexation, cation
              coordination, and ability to stabilize unusual oxidation states, will be
              undertaken.

With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program, Professor Jonathan Sessler is studying the interactions between ions
              and polycyclic organic compounds which function as receptors for them. 
              Potential analytical and medical applications for these polypyrrolic materials
              are anion sensing and purification, radioactive waste remediation, or as
              fluorescent markers  for the diagnosis of neoplastic or cardiovascular disease.
