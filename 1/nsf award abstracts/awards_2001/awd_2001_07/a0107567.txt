Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2001.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "New techniques for analyzing the representation of auditory stimulus features
              by ensembles of cortical neurons."  This project is concerned with the analysis
              of stimulus-related information contained in firing patterns of ensembles of 16
              or more simultaneously-recorded neurons in auditory cortex.  Statistical
              pattern recognition techniques are used to characterize relationships between
              the acoustic properties of sounds in space and information-bearing features of
              neural responses.
