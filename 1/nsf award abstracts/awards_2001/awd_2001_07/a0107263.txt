The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.
This award will provide 6 months of support to
              Dr. Sharon L. Stephenson of Gettysburg College to work with Dr. Eduard I.
              Sharapov at the Joint Institute of Nuclear Physics in Dubna, Russia on a direct
              measurement of the neutron-neutron scattering length at YAGUAR.  This project
              is being co-funded by the U.S.-Russia Cooperative Research Program and the MPS
              Directorate's Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.
A direct measurement of
              the neutron-neutron scattering length has never been done.  What is needed is a
              high instantaneous value for the neutron flux and a careful attention to
              systematic errors.  The relatively new YAGUAR pulsed reactor has the necessary
              instantaneous flux.  One way to address systematic errors is by modeling.  The
              PI will use the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) transport code to model the
              YAGUAR pulsed reactor in Snezhinsk, Russia.  She will help design and perform a
              first and second generation experiment; the first will achieve an accuracy in
              the neutron-neutron scattering length ann of 3% and the second 1%.
Dr.
              Sharapov is a professor of nuclear physics at the Joint Institute.  He is an
              authority on nuclear structure and is best known for leading the lanthanum
              parity violation experiment in the early 1980's.
