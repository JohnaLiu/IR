The International Research Fellowship Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty--four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.
This award will provide twelve months of
              support to Dr. Amy Ratcliffe to work with Dr. Gijs Walraven at the United
              Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC) in Banjul, The Gambia.  They will do
              research focused on gendered interests in reproduction and contributions by men
              and women to their children and households in a rural West African
              population.

This project is part of an on-going demographic study with the
              Reproductive Health Program at the United Kingdom MRC, Farafenni Field Station
              in The Gambia.  The PI has been involved in work describing men and women's
              diverse experience with reproduction in this population.  The PI will examine
              differences between men and women in terms of interests in reproduction as well
              as in personal resources, social networks, and household spending.  It will
              provide a foundation for future work comparing reproductive experiences of both
              sexes across rural and urban areas of The Gambia.  The understanding of changes
              in cultural norms will provide useful grounding for policy development that
              empowers women and encourages family communication and planning.  This will
              have implications for public health policy in Africa and elsewhere.

Dr.
              Walraven has an extensive background in epidemiology and reproductive health
              and has worked at the MRC Gambia since 1995.
