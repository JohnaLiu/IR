This is a three-year cooperative project between Dr. Tim
              Schowalter, Oregon State University, and Dr. Jung-Tai Chao, Taiwan Forestry
              Research Institute, to study canopy Arthropod responses to storm disturbances
              at the U.S. and Taiwan LTER sites.  Specifically, this project will compare the
              arthropod response to storm disturbances in early and late successful forests
              in wet temperate and tropical forests.  This is a good cross-site comparison
              that uses the facilities available from LTER sites in Taiwan and the United
              States to study a very important question: assessing the impacts by storm
              disturbances on natural ecosystems.   The proposed study could provide a basis
              of understanding the process that regulates insect diversity and functional
              roles in wet forest ecosystems. This project also provides an opportunity for a
              U.S. graduate student to work in Pacific subtropical ecosystems.  This proposal
              addresses an important scientific question and meets the NSF objective of human
              resource development. The National Science Council of Taiwan and the NSF
              jointly support this project.
