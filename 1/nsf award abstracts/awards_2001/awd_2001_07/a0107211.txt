Abstract    :
              This is funding to subsidize the expenses of graduate students participating in
              the doctoral consortium immediately preceding the Fourth International
              Conference on Cognitive Modeling (ICCM'2001), to be held July 26-28, 2001 in
              Fairfax, VA.   Computational modeling has emerged as a central, but complex and
              sometimes fractionated, theme in research on cognition.  The ICCM conferences
              provide a unique worldwide forum where researchers from diverse backgrounds
              come together to compare cognitive models, to evaluate models using human data,
              and to further the development, accumulation and integration of cognitive
              theory.   ICCM-2001 will be the first of these important events to take place
              outside of Europe.  Attending the conference and participating in the doctoral
              consortium which precedes it will enable the students to present their work to
              and receive feedback from the scientific community, will help them develop a
              supportive community, and will foster interaction with and mentoring by senior
              researchers.   The students will be selected by a committee, with special
              consideration to be given to students from under-represented groups and from
              institutions where cognitive modeling is not a strength.
