The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will provide twelve months of support to Dr.
              Gaines Tyler to work with Dr. Thomas H. Cribb at the University of Queensland
              in Brisbane, Australia.

This project will determine life-cycles for 9-12
              species of tapeworms from elasmobranches (final hosts).  DNA sequences from
              adult specimens will be used to construct a library.  Larval stages will be
              identified by comparing their DNA sequences to sequences in the library.  By
              identifying hosts for both adult and larva, the final stage of the life-cycle
              will be determined.  This project will address the specificity of parasite-host
              relationships in these cestode species.  The life cycles of tapeworms in
              elasmobranches are poorly known and this project will extend our
              knowledge.

The research site, Australia's Great Barrier Reef, hosts one of
              the greatest diversities of elasmobranches in the world.  Dr. Cribb has
              extensive experience in the resolution of flatworm life-cycles using molecular
              techniques.
