Abstract    :
              The mammalian skull is an integrated complex of overlapping units that are
              involved in multiple functions such as breathing, vision, hearing, smelling and
              swallowing. Therefore most morphological features in the skull tend to be
              considerably inter-correlated, limiting variation. Non-independent cranial
              features, however, are problematic for reconstructing evolutionary
              relationships, because they subjectively bias efforts to group most-closely
              related species. This study uses CAT scans and radiographs of primate skulls to
              test several hypotheses about interrelationships between the brain, cranial
              base and face in primates, in order to assess specifically the utility of skull
              characters for reconstructing evolutionary relationships in primates and human
              ancestors. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate techniques, including scaling
              and matrix analyses, will be used to test patterns of constraint and
              integration among skull characters in 70 primate species and growth samples of
              10 species of monkeys and apes. Preliminary results suggest that constraints
              which result from integration, while rare, considerably affect variations in
              primate skull form and should be taken into account when testing phylogenetic
              hypotheses about primate and human evolution.
