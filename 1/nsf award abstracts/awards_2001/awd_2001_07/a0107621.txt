Abstract    :
              This proposal concerns the exploration of new approaches to computational
              problems that arise in robotics, geographic information systems, and in
              biological applications.  These approaches involve techniques that lie at the
              intersection of mathematics and computer science and the application of
              mathematical perspectives in the development on new algorithms to solve a
              variety of problems.  The primary goal is to use techniques from Morse theory,
              homology theory, geometric group theory and combinatorics to study problems of
              shape, configuration, motion planning, and structure in computer science. 
              Applications include computer graphics, visualization of scientific data,
              computational analysis of molecular docking problems and robotics.  A key
              element is that this work will be done within an interdisciplinary team that
              includes researchers in computer science, biochemistry and chemistry at Duke,
              UNC and Stanford.

The research in this project will be important to advance
              our understanding in a number of important areas.  Techniques developed will
              give new approaches to analyzing noise in data sets such as those from x-ray
              Crystallography, brain scans, satellite images, and ocean temperature.  The
              robotics work will enhance our ability to create automated devices that perform
              tasks in dangerous or remote environments.  And the biology work has as its
              long term goal the development of better computational tools to help biomedical
              researchers find appropriate molecules that can interact with
