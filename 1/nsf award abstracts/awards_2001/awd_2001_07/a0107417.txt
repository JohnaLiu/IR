Abstract    :
              The LIGO Laboratory proposes the continued operation and development of the LIGO
              scientific program.  The construction of LIGO by Caltech and MIT, under
              Cooperative Agreement No. PHY-9210038, has been completed within budget and on
              the schedule defined in the rebaselining process in 1994.  The LIGO facilities
              are in full operation in support of the interferometer commissioning.  At the
              end of FY 2001, LIGO will be operating the three LIGO interferometers at the
              two LIGO observatory sites in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA.  During the
              period of this proposal, LIGO will carry out the first LIGO Science Run.  This
              will include operation of the three LIGO interferometers in a stable and
              sensitive scientific configuration, at the design dimensionless strain
              sensitivity (h ~ 10-21), for a minimum of an integrated year of coincidence
              running.  This data run will take place during the period 2002 through 2004. 
              During that period, operation of the interferometers will be interleaved with
              interferometer R&D and improvements.  These periods of interferometer studies
              will improve the detector sensitivity and availability for stable, scientific
              running.  The science goals of this run are to conduct the first broad search
              for astrophysical sources of gravitational waves with sensitivity never before
              attained.  LIGO has fostered the development of the LIGO Scientific
              Collaboration, consisting of researchers from the LIGO Laboratory and from
              external institutions in the U.S. and abroad.  The creation of the LIGO
              Scientific Collaboration has enabled broad participation in LIGO.  During the
              period of this proposal, the LIGO Scientific Collaborations will guide the
              gravitational wave research and the definition of the R&D toward technology
              improvements.  LIGO will build upon its program of education at each of the
              four LIGO Laboratory Sites, extending the scientific excitement of LIGO to
              young people from elementary to graduate levels.  Community outreach activities
              will be  extended to include new demonstration and interpretive programs.  LIGO
              collaboration with industry will address new technologies and applications
              stimulated by the requirements of gravitational wave observation.
