Great earthquakes represent large releases
              of energy and the ability to predict them is of obvious importance.  A number
              of models of earthquake temporal and spatial characteristics have been
              developed, but have not been adequately tested and validated, mostly because
              the historical record is very short in comparison to the typical time between
              earthquakes.  This project will attempt to provide a record of large
              earthquakes along the Cascadia margin that spans at least 10,000 years by use
              of turbidites as proxies for large earthquakes.  The results will be invaluable
              in testing earthquake recurrence models.
