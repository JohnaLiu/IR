Abstract    :
              Feeding activities of soil macrofauna exert critical influence upon the chemical
              and physical transformation of soil organic matter. In mesic and xeric habitats
              where earthworms are absent (e.g., parts of the Southwestern U.S.), soil
              isopods can be the primary detritivores. It is therefore likely that soil
              isopods play a pivotal role in organic matter processing, carbon and nitrogen
              cycling, and soil development in these regions. This research represents
              preliminary work on the influence of terrestrial isopods on the organic
              horizons of the soil profile through feeding and excretion. The research will
              utilize natural abundance 13C/12C ratios to investigate the source and fate of
              organic matter utilized by soil isopods. In feeding experiments to
              Armadillidium vulgare, a model organism for terrestrial isopod research due to
              its ubiquity, the investigators will determine feeding amount and rate across a
              gradient of soil organic substrates: green leaves, litter layer, and soil
              humus.  They will also assess changes in C:N, %C and *13C composition of
              organic matter during feces production. The research has widespread
              implications to ecosystem processes in mesic and xeric habitats, due to the
              global distribution of Armadillidium vulgare.
