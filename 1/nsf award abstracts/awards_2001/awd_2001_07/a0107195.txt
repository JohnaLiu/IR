Abstract    :
              We envision the development of an innovative optical cross-connect switch based
              on mechanical transducers for switching between optical waveguides as shown in
              Figure 1.  It consists of 4 input fibers connected to 4 input waveguides on the
              switch.  At each of the interconnect points, a microactivated micro-stage can
              be moved along a 45 axis to allow for steering the beam at 90 with respect to
              the original direction.  In this way, any inputs can be steered to any outputs
              in a non-blocking way.  Contrary to what is typically done in the area of
              micro-opto-electro-mechanical systems, the mechanical movements of the switch
              are not implemented using silicon technology but are directly realized in III-V
              compound semiconductors [1]. This has the important advantage of permitting the
              monolithic integration of active (i.e. semiconductor lasers, SOA, etc.) and
              passive waveguide devices (like the WDM filters, arrayed waveguide gratings)
              with the switching fabric.  It can be envisioned that this should lead to
              complex wavelength cross-connect systems on a single chip.  Switching time will
              be optimized by minimizing the mass of the moving parts and by reducing the
              required displacements to distances of the order of 3 microns.  Dissipation of
              activated in one of its possible states.  On the 4 output waveguides, SOA's are
              monolithically integrated to compensate for optical losses in the same way that
              we recently demonstrated a lossless 1 x 2 splitter.  A passive-active resonant
              coupler to move the mode from a passive waveguide to a vertically positioned
              active waveguide using the PARC platform technology [2] can be used for the
              integration.
