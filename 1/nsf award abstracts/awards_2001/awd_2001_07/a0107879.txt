This award provide funds to support a joint  Minerals, Metals,
              and Materials Society / Society of Plastics Engineers conference on polymer
              materials.  It will bring together traditional metallurgists and ceramicists
              who currently working in the polymers field and traditional polymer engineers
              to discuss several aspects of polymer materials.  The funds will be used to
              support graduate  and undergraduate student travel and participation in the
              conference.  There will be a graduate / undergraduate student poster contest as
              part of the symposia and graduate students will also present in the main
              symposium.
