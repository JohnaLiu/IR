The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.

This award will provide six months of
              support to Dr. Ginger A. Rebstock to work with Dr. Young Shil Kang at the
              National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI) in Pusan,
              Korea.

The objective of this project is to describe spatial and temporal
              variability in the zooplankton and hydrography of the seas surrounding the
              Korean peninsula.  Zooplankton samples have been collected bimonthly since 1965
              at 88 stations around the Korean peninsula by the NFRDI.  Zooplankton wet
              weight, counts of four important zooplankton taxa, and hydrographic and
              fisheries data are available in a computer database.  This project will
              identify modes or patterns of spatial variability in each variable, using
              Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF).  A time series will be calculated for
              each important mode to show how the strength of each mode varies over time. 
              Modes of different variables will be compared to determine their
              interrelationships.  The data set to be studied is one of the few multi-decadal
              marine zooplankton data sets in existence.
