High temperature corrosion is a topic of considerable
              technological importance that deals with very complex systems. The purpose of
              this conference is to examine fundamental issues of the corrosion process in
              order to understand and improve material performance in high-temperature
              applications. The conference includes the following sessions whose topics are
              considered timely for discussion and where significant recent developments have
              been made: 1. Effect of Water Vapor; 2. Fundamentals of the Oxide/Metal
              Interface; 3. Initial Stage Oxidation; 4. Bond Coat Oxidation; 5. Stresses in
              Scales and Coatings; 6. Stresses and Scale Failure; 7. High Temperature
              Coatings; 8. Corrosion in Aggressive Industrial Environments; and 9. Oxide
              Scales in Bio-Materials.  Nine sections are planned for the conference, each
              led by a scientist familiar with the subject area to facilitate discussions.
              Speakers are invited by the chair for their expertise and recent progress in
              areas deemed to be at the frontiers of science. Ample time is allowed after
              each presentation for extensive discussions between the speaker and the
              audience. Graduate students have been encouraged to attend and present posters.
              The poster sessions further broaden the program and create more opportunities
              for the exchange of ideas. The award is used to support graduate students so
              that they can have an opportunity to meet and interact with experts in their
              field in this unique environment.

The Gordon Research Conferences were
              established with the aim of bringing together scientists in a particular area
              and permit them to discuss in depth all aspects of the most recent advances in
              the field and to stimulate new directions for future research. This goal is met
              today by the selection of highly qualified speakers with a meeting format that
              promotes interactions and discussions.
