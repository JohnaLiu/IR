Abstract    :
              The invasion of novel habitats by populations can cause changes within the
              populations, and these changes can be the basis for the initial stages of
              speciation.  Urban areas represent novel habitats.  The Dark-eyed Junco, a
              passerine bird, recently invaded an urban habitat in San Diego, California. 
              First, urban juncos are compared with juncos in their natural habitat,
              coniferous-mixed forest, to determine if and how urban juncos have changed in
              morphology, plumage, behavior, and genetics.  Second, because the urban
              population is isolated, each junco can be uniquely color-banded and monitored
              throughout the year to determine individual reproductive and survival fates. 
              This enables a thorough study to determine which individuals have higher
              survival and reproductive rates, which traits are responsible for the
              differential rates, and how changes in certain traits affect other traits.
              

This research will shed light on the initial stages of speciation, a
              question central to biology but currently not well understood.  The research
              will also provide knowledge of practical importance - increasing our
              understanding of how urbanization affects species, and why, how, and at what
              rate species change as a result of urbanization.  There is also an important
              educational component to this work: each year approximately fifteen
              undergraduate and graduate students are involved in all aspects of the
              research.
