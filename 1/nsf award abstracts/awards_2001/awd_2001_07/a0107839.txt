Abstract    :
              Grid Forum is a grass-roots community organization that began as a BOF session
              at SC98 in November
1998. Grid Forum has held five highly successful workshops
              in the US since that time and has formed ten
focused working groups, each
              developing best practices and standards within a particular set of
              technical
areas. Over 500 individuals participate in Grid Forum electronic
              newsgroups and typical workshop
attendance is 150-190 people. Grid Forum has
              served as the primary gathering point and collaboration
vehicle for major
              initiatives including the NSF Partnerships for Advanced Computational
              Infrastructure
(PACI) program, NASA's Information Power Grid (IPG) program,
              the DoD modernization program, DOE
grid-based programs, and others.
Two of
              the primary advantages to the existence of such a collaboration vehicle are
              that it allows these
programs to leverage one another and it assures that the
              various agency-specific grid  systems are able to
interoperate. During the
              past year, Grid Forum has joined with similar efforts in Europe and
              Asia-Pacific,
increasing the opportunity to leverage to major grid projects
              outside of the US. Beyond the advantages of
leverage and ensuring
              interoperability, a single global standards activity ensures that grid
              technologies do
not fragment at continental boundaries.
Grid Forum will hold
              its sixth major workshop, "Global Grid Forum 1" in Amsterdam in March
              2001.
This meeting will be held in conjunction with the kick-off meeting for
              the European Data Grid project
that is managed by CERN. This project supports
              travel by approximately 30 US participants, including students and researchers
              from Minority Serving Institutions, to that meeting. The participants will
              be
recruited from the ranks of existing Grid Forum leaders.
