     The investigator develops mathematical methods that
              exploit
the special properties inherent in dynamical systems arising in
the
              biological sciences and applies them to specific problems.
The main focus is
              on the long-term behavior of the dynamics after
transient effects have
              disappeared.  The work on biofilms focuses
on systems of advection-diffusion
              equations coupled to ordinary
differential equations with coupled nonlinear
              boundary conditions
in piecewise-smooth domains.  Aside from well-posedness
              and the
existence of multiple steady states, which are nontrivial
questions,
              the important biological information comes from key
eigenvalues for associated
              nonstandard eigenvalue problems and
their dependence on parameters.  Both
              mathematical analysis and
numerical simulations are required for an
              understanding.  The work
on the paradox of the plankton focuses on the
              classical model of
n-species exploitative competition for k
              essential
(non-substitutable) nutrients.  If n is larger than k there can
              be
no equilibrium coexistence of all n species so one must seek
oscillatory
              coexistence.  The investigator exploits certain
heteroclinic structures
              (cycles of equilibria) that arise
naturally in such systems in order to seek
              periodic coexistence
solutions.  The theory of competitive and cooperative
              systems can
play a significant role.  Abstract dynamical systems theory
              comes
into play in the work on robust persistence. 
              Specifically,
understanding chain recurrent sets and Morse decompositions
              of
the boundary dynamics (where one or more species are absent) are
key to
              showing that persistence for a dynamical system is robust
to perturbation of
              that system or of its parameters.
     Dynamical systems that arise naturally
              in many areas in the
biological sciences often have special features not
              shared by
systems arising in the physical sciences.  Broadly speaking,
              the
investigator develops mathematical methods that exploit these
special
              properties and applies them to specific problems.  The
main focus is on the
              long-term behavior of the dynamics after
transient effects have disappeared. 
              Progress in this area can
help to answer important biological questions that
              are subject to
mathematical modeling, such as whether an infectious
              disease
becomes endemic in a population or becomes extinct, or which
species
              in an ecosystem can survive and which will become
extinct.  A substantial
              effort is devoted to understanding the
dynamics of mathematical models in
              three areas of the
biosciences.  The first is microbial growth and competition
              in
environmental settings where biofilms may form on surfaces.
Biofilms are
              of great importance in the health sciences and food
industry where their
              formation typically results in negative
outcomes.  They are responsible for
              food and water contamination,
dental caries and periodontal disease, and the
              contamination of
medical implants.  The investigator studies under what
              conditions
biofilms may form and what bacterial densities can be
              expected.
The second is a fundamental issue in population biology,
              the
so-called "paradox of the plankton": why can so many plankton
species
              (and, more generally, species of other taxa) be supported
by so few limiting
              resources?  The investigator provides
mathematically rigorous results for the
              existence of oscillatory
coexistence states of the relevant mathematical
              models when the
number of species exceeds the number of resources, as is
              typical
in natural environments.  The third is a more robust theory
              of
persistence (also called permanence) for dynamical systems
arising in
              population dynamics.  In its simplest form, this theory
seeks not to determine
              the global behavior of solutions of a
dynamical system representing
              interacting populations but rather
to answer the more basic question: What
              species are present at
the end of the day?  While past research in this area
              has
primarily ignored the fact that population models are only
approximately
              correct, the investigator seeks to provide answers
to the basic question that
              hold true for all small perturbations
of the model equations.
