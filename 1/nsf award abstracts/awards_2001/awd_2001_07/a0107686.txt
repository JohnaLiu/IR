Title:  SGER: Exploratory
              Research on Transnational Digital Government

This grant will support a
              preliminary study of the uses of information technologies to support
              multilateral collaborations between two South American countries in the topic
              area of drug abuse and trafficking.  Important topics to be surmounted include
              the many differences in infrastructure and processes related to data gathering,
              and the differing legal and security regimes in place.  There will be an
              element of multi-lingualism to be explored also.  The collaboration will begin
              with the support and approval of the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control
              Commission of the Organization of American States  (OAS).  The Commission has
              developed a process and procedures for multilateral government evaluation of
              various drug abuse parameters, which will serve as the context in which to
              evaluate collaboration technologies research.  Researchers from several US
              universities and the OAS will participate.
