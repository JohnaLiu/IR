Title:	Dissertation Research: Role of a Dominant Grazer in a Headwater
              Stream Food Web


The proposed research addresses a fundamental question in
              ecology:  what determines the structure of food webs?  In general, a suite of
              manipulative field experiments is designed to quantify the control that
              herbivorous species can exert on stream food webs.   Manipulations of the
              abundance and phenology of a dominant grazing invertebrate (Glossosoma), in
              combination with stable isotope analyses, will determine if the presence and
              density of Glossosoma control the use of algae and detritus (alternative energy
              sources in streams) by other species of consumers.  Because Glossosoma is
              relatively invulnerable to predation as a consequence of its morphology (a
              stone case), it may prevent predator species from exerting controls over
              herbivores.  This will be quantified with regard to a common predator, the
              Giant Pacific Salamander (Dicamptodon tenebrosus).  The proposed work will test
              in a rigorous manner, the hypothesis that herbivores exert "intermediate
              control" over the structure of food webs.
