Title: 3-D structure and
              tectonic interpretation of the Cascadia crust and subducting slab from SHIPS
              and earthquake data

PI's:  Robert S. Crosson, Kenneth Creager University of
              Washington

In the Pacific Northwest, subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate
              beneath the margin of North America (Cascadia subduction zone) causes
              earthquakes on the plate boundary, as well as within both the continental crust
              and the subducting plate (slab). Seismic hazards are of particular concern in
              western Washington State owing to the concentration of population and
              earthquakes in this region. The hazard due to earthquakes in the subducting
              Juan de Fuca slab was underscored by the recent magnitude 6.8 earthquake of
              February 2001 in the southern Puget Sound region. To make progress in
              understanding the tectonic processes giving rise to earthquakes in this region,
              it is necessary to gain a better understanding of the structure of both the
              crust and upper mantle. Fortunately, recent seismic experiments using
              controlled sources of energy, such as the SHIPS (Seismic Hazards in Puget
              Sound) experiment, have provided extensive data which can be used to obtain
              high resolution images of seismic wave speed in the crust, as well as images of
              the subducting slab from reflections. In this project, we will combine data
              from several recent "active source" seismic experiments with extensive
              earthquake observations from the Pacific Northwest seismograph network (PNSN)
              to produce a high quality but large-scale model of P wave speed of the crust
              and upper mantle to a depth of 50-60 km. This model will be used to improve our
              knowledge of the locations of earthquake recorded by the PNSN, and also to
              accurately model reflected waves from the subducted slab in order to better
              understand the origin of slab earthquakes. We plan to provide an internet
              distribution site for our models and interpretations from this project.
