Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to study mixing processes and cloud droplet
              growth as part of DYCOMS-II (Dynamics and Chemistry of Marine Stratocumulus), a
              collaborative field program conducted off the coast of California in July 2001.
               The experimental program, based on the NSF C-130 research aircraft, will
              provide data of unprecedented high resolution on air motions, temperature, and
              humidity.  The Particle Volume Monitor (PVM) of Dr. Gerber will also be
              deployed, to give information on the fine-scale variability of cloud water
              content.  Four studies related to entrainment and mixing at cloud top will be
              undertaken:
1. Estimation of entrainment rate using high-resolution
              measurements of liquid water content, humidity, and vertical air velocity.
2.
              Investigation of the cause of an apparent "scale break" at a scale of several
              meters in the spectrum of liquid water content fluctuations.
3. Formulation of
              a conceptual model of the structure of the cloud-top layer.
4. Exploring the
              possibility of enhanced condensation near cloud top caused by the mixing of air
              parcels with different temperatures.
The ultimate goal of the research is to
              improve the ability to model the development of marine stratocumulus clouds,
              taking into account mixing processes at cloud top.  This will lead to better
              parameterization of cloud processes in climate models.
