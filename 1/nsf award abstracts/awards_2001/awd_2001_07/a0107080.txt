There are
              a number of unresolved yet fundamental questions about the nature of mantle
              upwellings or "plumes". Specifically, can we distinguish the plume model, i.e.,
              material upwelling from parts of the deeper mantle, from alternative models as
              a source for mantle hotspots? To help answer these questions, we will make
              measurements of shear-wave splitting for seismic waves that travel through the
              upper mantle. These measurements can illuminate the geometry of flow-related
              mantle deformation, since such deformation leads to seismic anisotropy--the
              cause of shear-wave splitting. We will then compare our data to those predicted
              by several different models of plume/lithosphere interaction. In particular,
              the "parabolic asthenospheric flow" model, which is consistent with
              measurements from around Hawaii and Yellowstone, will be critically tested by
              our data. Although these data may address regional problems such as whether
              there is a relation between Eifel magmatism and extension in the Rhine Graben,
              they more fundamentally have the ability to detect the existence of plumes,
              answering an outstanding question in the geosciences.
