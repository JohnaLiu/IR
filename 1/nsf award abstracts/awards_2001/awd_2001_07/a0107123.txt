The Cambrian explosion and its Neoproterozoic precursors
              occurred in a context of extraordinary environmental perturbations, including
              extreme fluctuations between warm and cold climate, possible True Polar Wander,
              at least one significant impact event, and the reorganization and eventual
              breakup of a supercontinent.  The tectonic events may have been a primary cause
              of both climatic and polar wander events.  Despite significant progress over
              the last decade, the lack of absolute age control on key successions has
              severely limited developing reliable global correlations and a chronology of
              rifting and continental plate motions on a par with the Phanerozoic.  For this
              project, the investigators are obtaining U/Pb ages of authigenic xenotime
              overgrowths on detrital zircons, as well as standard U/Pb dating on detrital
              zircons, on sandstones from the relatively complete Neoproterozoic succession
              in southwestern Laurentia (Kingston and Panamint Ranges, southern California). 
              This succession contains a rich record of multiple rifting events and
              subsequent passive margin subsidence, interspersed with a record of glaciations
              and subsequent warming events, incisions, and a possible impact event.  The
              investigators have sampled key areas that contain a number of structural and
              stratigraphic constraints on the relative timing of rifting and glaciation, and
              are testing a recent hypothesis that a particular sandstone horizon in the
              passive margin sequence contains detritus derived from the Acraman impact
              structure, which would provide a key time-correlative horizon between East
              Gondwana and Laurentia, and suggest proximity of southern Australia and
              southwestern Laurentia during subsidence.
