This study proposes to advance the status of Silurian
              radiolarian biostratigraphy through the collection and analysis of radiolarians
              from well-dated pristine sections of basinal marine strata in the Cape Phillips
              Formation, Canadian Arctic. Radiolarian data will be integrated with other
              useful biostratigraphic and geochemical datums with the goals of 1) generating
              a composite biostratigraphic standard for the Cape Phillips Basin, and 2)
              calibrating radiolarian datums that appear to have global biostratigraphic
              significance. This study should produce the most comprehensive and best
              calibrated data set ever generated for Silurian radiolarians and will be of
              fundamental importance in providing better age control for complexly deformed
              and poorly dated basinal sequences in orogenic belts around the world.
              Radiolarians and graptolites will be collected from at least three sections of
              Wenlockian - Ludlovian Strata on Devon and Cornwallis Islands and combined with
              six other Llandoverian-Ludlovian sections sampled by the PI and her
              collaborator, Dr. A. C. Lenz, during past field seasons. The graptolites are
              well studied and serve as the basis for biostratigraphic correlation and age
              control.  A 1999 pilot study of carbon isotope geochemistry shows that there
              are at least two positive excursions that may serve as chemostratigraphic
              datums that may be integrated with the paleontologic data. Isotope geochemistry
              will be conducted on additional sections to further determine the reliability
              and extent of these chemostratigraphic datums.
