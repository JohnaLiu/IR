Abstract    :
              Professor Lawrence T. Scott, of the Department of Chemistry at Boston College,
              is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his
              studies of the rational synthesis of fullerenes and other carbon-rich
              materials, including achiral, single-wall carbon nanotubes which are closed at
              one end and open at the other, with predefined uniform diameter, pitch, cap
              structure, and rim structure. As test cases for the methods and strategies
              employed, Professor Scott also explores the synthesis of low molecular weight
              (<1500 amu) carbon-rich organic compounds with unusual structures, for which
              unusual molecular properties are anticipated.

Fullerenes, carbon nanotubes,
              and related carbon-rich substances that are characterized by curved networks of
              carbon atoms have been widely acclaimed as materials of enormous potential
              value for future applications in materials science and the emerging field of
              nanotechnology. They also hold considerable intrinsic scientific interest owing
              to the unusual nature of their chemical structures. These fascinating
              substances are typically prepared by poorly-understood empirical methods,
              making control over which fullerenes or nanotubes are formed exceedingly
              difficult. With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program, Professor Lawrence T. Scott, of the Department of Chemistry at Boston
              College, is developing rational synthetic routes to fullerenes and other
              "Buckymaterials," as well as to smaller carbon-rich organic molecules also
              anticipated to display unusual properties.
