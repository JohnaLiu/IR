Abstract.
It is planned to obtain necessary and sufficient
              conditions, as well as  explicit necessary and explicit sufficient conditions,
              for the discreteness of spectrum of magnetic Schroedinger operators on
              Euclidean space and on Riemannian manifods with geometric restrictions. 
              Presumably the conditions will be given in terms of separation of fields and
              effective potentials. They will use Wiener capacity and its generalization -
              magnetic capacity.
Physically we are looking for conditions when electrons
              display a discrete spectrum and are confined into bounded domains for any fixed
              value of their energy, when such a behavior of electrons results from a joint
              action of electric and magnetic fields.
