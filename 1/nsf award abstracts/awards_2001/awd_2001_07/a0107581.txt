Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2001.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "How does neural activity instruct the system-wide modifications in brain
              structure that occur during development of the visual system?"  Spontaneously
              generated "retinal waves" are required for early visual system development. 
              This research uses a combined theoretical and experimental approach to
              determine (1) how physiologically relevant neural input causes appropriate
              modifications at individual retinogeniculate synapses, and (2) how these
              retinal-wave-driven modifications result in system-wide competition that drives
              retinogeniculate development.
