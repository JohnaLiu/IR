The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide
opportunities for joint research, and
              the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will provide 24 months of support to Dr.
              Kellee Tsai to work with Dr. Houyi Zhang at the Chinese Academy of Social
              Sciences in Beijing, China on a study of capitalism without democracy, the
              political orientation of private entrepreneurs in China.  The Political Science
              Program of NSF is providing partial support of this project.

This project
              will analyze the political orientation of private entrepreneurs in China by
              conducting a national survey of private entrepreneurs in collaboration with the
              Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.  The survey results will speak to the
              controversial issue of whether China's growing private sector constitutes the
              basis of a pro-democratic middle class.

Dr. Zhang is the Director of the
              Rural Sociology Research Division of CASS who 
has worked on national projects
              funded by the PRC State Council, National 
Economic Reform Foundation,
              National Industry and Commercial Bureau and serves 
on the Board of all the
              key national research entities involved in private 
sector research.
