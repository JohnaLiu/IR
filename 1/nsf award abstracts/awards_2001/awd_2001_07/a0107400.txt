Abstract    :
              
The dominant geologic feature of the New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ) is the
              Mississippi Embayment that extends from southern Illinois to the Gulf of
              Mexico.  It is composed of deep, unconsolidated sediments with a maximum
              thickness of approximately 915 m near Memphis, TN.  Relatively little data is
              available on the dynamic properties of soils in the Embayment.  As a result,
              current efforts to understand the effects of the deep sediment column on
              earthquake site response are subject to large uncertainties.

This objective
              of this exploratory research project is to perform geophysical logging and
              obtain samples from a deep well to be drilled in northeast Arkansas.  The
              expected results are the seismic wave velocities, quality factors, and
              nonlinear behavior of the Embayment soils.  When combined with a complementary
              effort to install a vertical array in the well, this project will enable the
              development and validation of numerical models used to predict earthquake site
              response in the Mississippi Embayment.
