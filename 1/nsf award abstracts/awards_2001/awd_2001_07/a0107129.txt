Title: Stress Transfer and
              Accelerating Seismicity Before Large Earthquakes

PI's: David Bowman,
              California State University-Fullerton, and Charles Sammis, University of
              Southern California

In recent years, observational and theoretical
              descriptions of spatio-temporal patterns of seismicity have focused on two
              fundamental (and controversial) observations: static stress (Coulomb)
              interactions between earthquakes and accelerating seismic moment release before
              large earthquakes. We have previously shown that simple stress change
              calculations can be used to define a region of accelerating seismicity before
              large earthquakes in California.  In this project, we have three main goals: 1)
              To test the "false-alarm rate" of our method using seismicity in California, 2)
              To test the stability of our methodology in other seismically active regions
              worldwide, and 3) To develop a geologically realistic numerical model of a
              spatially-extended fault network that produces accelerating seismicity before
              large events.  The goal of our project is to advance our understanding of fault
              interactions and ultimately to develop a method of monitoring the earthquake
              hazard in seismically active regions.
