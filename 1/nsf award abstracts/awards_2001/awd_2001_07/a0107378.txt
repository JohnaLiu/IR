The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will provide twelve months of support to Dr.
              Gregory D. Smith to work with Dr. Steve Weiner at the Weizmann Institute's
              Kimmel Center for Archaeological Science in Rehovot, Israel.
This project
              involves the reconstruction of paleogeochemical environments of cave shelters
              in order to assess the completeness of their archaeological records. 
              Authigenic minerals identified in situ at prehistoric sites will serve as
              paleoenvironmental indicators.  They will be purified and their solubilities
              studied under varying conditions in order to predict past diagenetic
              conditions.  Armed with such knowledge, archaeologists will know better how the
              archaeological record is affected or altered by post-depositional chemical
              diagenesis.  It is expected that results from this work will be applicable not
              only to prehistoric cave archaeology, but to other areas of archaeology as well
              as geology.

Dr. Weiner is the director of the newly established Kimmel
              Center, as well as professor of Structural Biology at the Weizmann Institute.
