              Abstract

Partial travel and conference fee support is requested for some of
              the graduate students and young faculty who shall make presentations at the
              "Particles 2001" International Conference to be held on 24-27 February 2001 in
              Orlando, Florida.  The purpose is to advance the interdisciplinary state of the
              art in the synthesis and characterization of particles and also in
              particle-based materials synthesis.  These challenges involve most often
              processes at the nanoscale range, e.g. self-assembly, templating or force field
              approaches.  Three plenary speakers of international recognition have been
              chosen from the disciplines of engineering, chemistry and physics. 
              Approximately 180 specialists have accepted invitations to speak in a series of
              symposia which shall focus on basic particle processes, on materials,
              pharmaceutical and biomedical applications, etc...80 more papers have been
              contributed for oral presentation.  Two poster sessions will enable still more
              people to share their concepts and results.  A very detailed listing of titles
              and speakers is available and kept up to date through the webside
              "nanopaarticles.org".  
The focus on the role of nanoparticles in such areas
              as advanced materials, particle formation and characterization seems to be
              enough of a discipline overlap to generate an interdisciplinary stimulus.
