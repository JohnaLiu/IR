The 17th North American Meeting
              of the Catalysis Society will be held June 3-8 in Toronto, Canada. These
              meetings of the Catalysis Society are held biannually.  Symposium topics
              include recent advances in many areas of catalysis including environmental
              catalysis, natural gas conversion, catalyst preparation, catalyst deactivation,
              novel catalytic processes, photocatalysis, selective oxidations and
              hydrogenations, polymerization and homogeneous catalysis, zeolites,
              heterogeneous organic synthesis, and pharmaceutical and fine chemical
              production. The objective of this proposal is to defray costs of meeting
              attendance, especially for graduate students and young investigators.  With
              co-funding from other sources, support for about 80 graduate students will be
              provided for meeting attendance.  Special emphasis will be placed on bringing
              young researchers to the meeting.
