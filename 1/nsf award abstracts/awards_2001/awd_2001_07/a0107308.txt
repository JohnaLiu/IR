The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will support a twenty-four month postdoctoral
              research fellowship by Dr. William J. Drury III to work with Dr. Dr. Andreas
              Pfaltz at the University of Basel in Switzerland.

The overall goal of this
              project is the development and application of new homogenous, asymmetric
              transition metal catalysts.  The design of the proposed metal ligands is based
              upon an attempt to convert well-known, highly active, achiral catalysts into
              new chiral catalysts.  The complexes will be tested in familiar arenas for both
              asymmetric induction, as well as catalytic efficiency.  Once this has been
              assessed, the complexes will be used to develop new methodology.  I have
              identified two classes of compounds for which no asymmetric route exists.  The
              use of the rationally designed catalysts in asymmetric hydrogenation gives
              rapid entry into these compounds that include highly pharmacologically active
              1-phenyl-2-aminopropane derivatives.

Dr. Pfaltz is a world leader in the
              field of asymmetric catalysis.  The University, as well as Dr. Pfaltz have
              close contacts with international corporations such as Novartis and Fluka,
              centered in Basel.
