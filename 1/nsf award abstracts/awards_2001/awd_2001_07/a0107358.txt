The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide twelve months of support to Dr.
              Bianca Sclavi to work with Dr. Malcolm Buckle at Institut Gustave Roussy in
              Villejuif, France on the kinetics of E-. coli RNA polymerase-promoter
              interactions.
This project is a continuation of work with Dr. Buckle on the
              study of the structural kinetics of bacterial transcription in order to better
              understand how this process is regulated by different cellular factors such as
              activator or repressor proteins.  They are using a combination of three
              different techniques - DNAase footprinting, cross linking and x-ray
              footprinting)  that give a unique understanding of the different conformational
              changes taking place during the recognition of a promoter by the E.coli RNA
              polymerase.
Dr. Buckle is the Head of the Laboratory of Enzymology and
              Structural Kinetics.
