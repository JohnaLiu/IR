Abstract    :
              Over the past five years, the Principal Ivestigator and student assistants have
              developed a series of Internet-based courses in a related set of undergraduate
              mathematics courses utilizing locally developed software for geometric
              visualization and for communication betwee students and instructors and among
              students.  These new models for teaching and learning change the timing and the
              level of interactivity for instructors and students, and increase the ability
              of students to handle complex geometric phenomena.  These innovations provide
              new models for teaching and learning which will be further developed, tested,
              and evaluated during the period of the proposal.  The aim is to produce
              effective software that can be used in a wide variety of institutions with
              students at different levels, for mathematics and for its applications to
              physical science, computer science, and engineering.  (Areas of concentration:
              quadrats 2 and 3.)
