Abstract    :
              In this RUI proposal funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of
              the Chemistry Division, Cindy Samet of the Dickinson College will pursue a
              program of research on very weak hydrogen bonding between substituted cyclic
              hydrocarbons and Lewis bases.  The interactions under study involve
              hydrocarbon-base complexes with C-H --- N (or O) hydrogen bonding.  Hydrocarbon
              systems of interest are halogenated cyclopropane and cyclopentadiene, while
              bases are ammonia, trimethylamine, and dimethyl ether.  Fourier Transform
              Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy combined with matrix isolation in argon and
              nitrogen matrices will be complemented by ab initio calculations.  

This
              project will serve to elucidate conditions necessary for hydrogen bonds to
              form.  These complexes can serve as a model for hydrogen bonding in more
              complicated systems such as organic liquid crystals and large biomolecules. 
              Eventually these studies may have an impact on our understanding of how protein
              folding occurs, how supramolecular assemblies form, and how certain crystals
              grow.  All of these subjects are important, for example, in designing and
              creating new pharmaceuticals or advanced materials.
