Abstract    :
              Prochlorococcus, a marine cyanobacterium, is a dominant phototroph in the
              world's oceans which contribute up to 50% of oceanic primary productivity.  The
              complete genome sequences of two Prochlorococcus isolates have recently been
              completed by the Joint Genome Institute of the DOE.  This study will develop
              complete genome microarrays to study gene expression in these isolates.  This
              technology will not only help to identify the numerous unidentified genes in
              these organisms that have no homologues in sequence databases, but they will
              also provide insights into the environmental variables that have driven niche
              diversification in this group. Prochlorococcus thrives due to the existence of
              multiple ecotypes, each slightly specialized to thrive optimally under a
              slightly different set of environmental conditions.  Pending the success of
              this project, a full-blown study will be conducted applying this array to the
              evolution and ecology of this organism.  The array will also be made available
              to others.
