Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2001.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Determining population structure and dynamics of Class II transposable element
              families in Arabidopsis thaliana, using a coalescence-based population genetic
              approach."  Transposons are major constituents of most eukaryotic genomes that
              can dramatically alter genomic architecture, individual fitness, and species
              evolution.  Little is known about population dynamics and behavior of
              transposons.  In this research, the availability of complete genome sequence
              and biological informatics capability provides a novel opportunity to evaluate
              their impact and the forces that influence their movement.
