Dr. Frye is awarded an NSF Astronomy
              and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research,
              education, and public outreach at Princeton University.  Her research program
              focuses on efforts to measure the total mass of a galaxy cluster, an important
              step in understanding the distribution of total mass in the Universe.  Clusters
              act like massive geometric lenses in space, distorting the shapes and apparent
              positions of the light sources behind them.  One can map out the lensing galaxy
              by studying the effects of shear and magnification.  Using a technique
              developed in her previous work, she will now be able to measure the
              magnification, which enlarges the total field of view and increases the galaxy
              brightness.  Coupled with measurements of the shear, these determinations will
              lead to a unique measurement of total mass.    Dr. Frye will also undertake a
              three-year mentoring program for girls and young women designed to encourage
              them in science and to identify the best ways of mentoring them.
