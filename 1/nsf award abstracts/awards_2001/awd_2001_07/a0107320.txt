The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.

This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research fellowship by Dr. Francesco N. Tubiello to work with Dr.
              Gunther Fischer at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis
              (IIASA)  in Laxenburg, Austria.

Working with Dr. Fischer, who directs the
              Land Use Change Unit at IIASA, Dr. Tubiello will investigate the impacts of
              agricultural practices on regional climate and the carbon cycle.  They will
              develop an interactive agricultural component for a general circulation model
              (GCM) using the Goddard Institute for Space Studies-CGM and the IIASA global
              agro-ecological zone model, GAEZ.  This will provide a coupled global
              climate-agricultural model, with simplified rules for crop management, such as
              planting and harvesting schedules and water applications and a set of
              simulations focusing on the regional scale, to investigate the interactions
              among climate, carbon sequestration, and agricultural land use.

IIASA is an
              international research institute.  The necessary datasets and model for this
              project were developed there and are now housed at IIASA.
