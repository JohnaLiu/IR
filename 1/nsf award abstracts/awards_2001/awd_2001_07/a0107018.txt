The Bloomington Geometry Workshop is the first of an intended
series
              of regional conferences on geometry.  The main purpose of
the Bloomington
              Geometry Workshop, to be held at the University
of Indiana, is to promote
              scientific cooperation and
communication between geometers and geometric
              analysts in a
region including Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio,
              and
Tennessee.

Modern geometry addresses problems such as understanding the
              ways
in which typical spaces are curved and how far from the flat
Euclidean
              model a space might be, the influence of curvature upon
analysis in a
              particular geometry, interactions of large-scale
geometry with probability
              theory and the algebraic properties of
the fundamental group, hyperbolic
              geometry and the portion of
low-dimensional topology that increasingly depends
              upon
hyperbolic structures, and gauge field theories and other ideas
from
              theoretical physics.
