Abstract    :
              The focus of this five-year program is to assess the seasonal and interannual
              physical and biological variability of the Alaska Coastal Current (ACC). 
              Specifically the PIs will investigate the seasonal and interannual variability
              in ACC freshwater content and transport, the ACC's role in governing
              spring-time mixed layer evolution over the shelf, processes controlling
              temporal and spatial variability in the spring bloom, and processes that may
              produce onshore nutrient flux.  These processes are inherently
              three-dimensional and exhibit a wide range of temporal scales.  To address
              these sampling requirements, this program will exploit the capabilities of a
              new, autonomous, telemetering vehicle (Seaglider) to make continuous,
              high-resolution sections of the ACC.  Seaglider measures temperature,
              conductivity, pressure, chlorophyll fluorescence, dissolved oxygen and volume
              scattering function, profiles from the surface to within 10 m, of the bottom
              and provides 2 km horizontal resolution.  The vehicle will operate year-round,
              repeating a sampling pattern designed to provide five sections across the ACC
              every twenty days.  The sampling strategy was designed to augment existing
              GLOBEC Long Term Observation Program components.  The temporal and spatial
              resolution provided by Seaglider surveys will resolve processes such as
              springtime restratification and phytoplankton blooms, while the multi-year
              extent of these observations will explore the system's response to long
              timescale perturbations in forcing.
