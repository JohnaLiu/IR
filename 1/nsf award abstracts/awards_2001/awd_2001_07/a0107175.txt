Support is requested for acquisition of a new automation
              system for the JEOL JXA-8600 electron microprobe in the Department of Earth and
              Planetary Sciences at Johns Hopkins University.  The instrument is 13 years old
              and a number of components are failing and unreliable including the memory
              devices, the LSI 11/73 computer, the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), and
              the stage motor drives.  In addition, because the operating system, EDS, and
              computers are outdated, the instrument is incapable of a number of important
              functions that modern microprobes can perform such as light element detection
              by EDS (B through F); position-tagged spectroscopy; simultaneous collection of
              images and compositional data; integrated data collection, data reduction, and
              image processing with the same computer; and rapid exchange of images and
              analytical data between the microprobe and external computers.  Support is also
              requested to replace the aging and dysfunctional carbon coater in the
              microprobe laboratory.  An upgraded electron microprobe would be used in a wide
              variety of research projects including studies in metamorphic petrology,
              igneous petrology, mineralogy, crystallography, sedimentology, geochemistry,
              geochronology, radioactive waste disposal and remediation, materials science,
              and medicine.  An electron microprobe, operating at top performance, will
              continue to play a key role in training the next generation of Earth scientists
              by serving as a principal research instrument for students at the
              undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels.  The Department of Earth and
              Planetary Sciences and the School of Arts and Sciences have pledged to cover
              16.7% and 33.3% of the cost of the acquisition, respectively.  NSF is requested
              to cover the remaining 50%.  The Department will continue to support the
              electron microprobe facility by paying the salary and benefits of the
              technician.  The School of Arts and Sciences will continue to support the
              facility with an annual block contribution.
