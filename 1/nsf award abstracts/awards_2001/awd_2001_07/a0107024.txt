Upon the breakup of the
              supercontinent Rodinia, several Precambrian lithotectonic assemblages were
              truncated along the western margin of Laurentia, but present data are too
              sparse to unambiguously identify the matching continental blocks, and the
              Siberian platform, Antarctica and Australia are possible matches.  This project
              is aimed at strengthening the geochronologic, petrographic and structural data
              for selected sites in northwest US in order to narrow the possible matches. 
              Results, combined with existing and new similar data from other continental
              blocks are expected to clarify the nature of Rodinia and the subsequent
              evolution of the fragments of Rodinia after continental breakup.
