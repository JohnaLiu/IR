Abstract    :
              The main goals of this project are concerned with the study of the
regularity
              properties of the solutions of the nonlinear wave equations
that arise in
              connection with the Einstein equations and more general
quasilinear wave
              equations. In particular, we address the questions of
local well posedness for
              the above equations. This project also
investigates the global dispersive
              effects for the linear Schroedinger
equation with variable
              coefficients.


The Einstein equations is one of the cornerstones of the
              theory of
relativity. They play  a fundamental role in the description of
              the
structure of the universe. Since the equations can not be
              solved
explicitly with exception of a few very special cases, we need
              to
understand the qualitative properties of its solutions. We try
              to
understand whether the solutions persist in time without exhibiting
an
              abnormal behavior. To gain insight we do it for the more general
class of
              equations. We also interested in understanding the connections
between the
              classical and quantum behavior of particles. This leads
us to the study of the
              behavior of solutions of the fundamental
equation of the quantum mechanics,
              the Schroedinger equation.
