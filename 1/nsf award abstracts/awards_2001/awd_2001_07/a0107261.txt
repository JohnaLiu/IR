The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide
opportunities for joint research, and
              the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will provide 24 months of support to Dr.
              Stephen F. Marino to work with Professor Andreas Plueckthun at the University
              of Zurich in Switzerland. 

The goal of this project is the generation of
              G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) amenable to structural studies.  GPCRs are
              integral membrane proteins that are primary receptors responsible for
              olfaction, vision, taste, hormonal and neuronal action.  Between 1 and 3% of
              the vertebrate genome is thought to code for GPCR-like sequences and they are
              the primary targets of up to 50% of all pharmaceuticals.  Structures of other
              GPCRs would allow the scientific community to understand how GPCRs can bind
              diverse ligands such as peptides, nucleotides, amino acids, lipids, ions, etc. 
              

The Plueckthun lab has pioneered ribosome display applications, making it
              the best place to conduct this research.
