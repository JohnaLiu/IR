Abstract    :
              The Turtle Mountain Technical Assistance Center project will conduct leadership
              development and capacity building activities for a group of tribally-controlled
              colleges in the Upper Great Plains.  The activities will be determined by the
              goals of the individual colleges in conjunction wit judgements made by the
              expert staff of the reently expired Tribal College Rural Systemic Initiative. 
              Findings will be disseminated through the professional outreach avenues of the
              key leadership.
