The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.

This award will support a twelve-month
              postdoctoral research fellowship for Dr. Helen H. Henderson to work with Dr.
              Carl Langebaek at the Universidad de Los Andes in Bogota, Colombia.

This
              project involves the investigation of the political strategies of prehistoric
              Muisca chiefdoms of Colombia by reconstructing the internal organization of two
              central communities from 800 AD to 1600 AD.  The PI will reconstruct long term
              patterns in household production, wealth differentiation, long distance
              exchange, and the spatial organization of two central Muisca communities to
              evaluate current models of complex society that view early political leaders as
              1) able to directly control local production or 2) able to control religious
              activities, long distance exchange or warfare.

Dr. Langebaek has extensive
              knowledge of ethnohistoric sources, as well as experience in fieldwork in the
              Muisca area and specifically, the Valle de Leyva.
