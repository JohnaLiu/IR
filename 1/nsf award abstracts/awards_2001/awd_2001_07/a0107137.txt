The investigators propose to develop dynamic models of the
              interaction of plate tectonics with mantle convection and continental
              deformation.  They will continue with modeling studies in which mantle dynamics
              is  placed within an explicit plate tectonics framework, such that models are
              tested with observations in both the time domain (for example geological
              constraints on surface uplift) and present day geophysical observations (such
              as seismic tomography). They will explicitly focus on three problems which are
              well posed within a plate tectonics framework: 1.) The large-scale flow since
              the Early Cretaceous associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland;  2.) The
              time-dependent evolution of the Tonga-Kermadec subduction zone since its
              inception during the Eocene; 3.) The deformation of western North American
              lithosphere and upper mantle since the Middle Miocene.  In all cases, they will
              use a common methodology in which the convection equations are solved within a
              spherical domain using a finite element code capable handling problems with
              very large variations in viscosity. They will solve large, well-resolved
              problems using the parallelized software on an in-house 312 processor Beowulf
              computer.
