              ABSTRACT

O'Connell, John P.

The International
              Conferences on Properties and Phase Equilibria for Product and Process Design
              (ICPPEPPD) are held every three years.  For the Past 21 years the locations
              have alternated between North America
and Europe; in 2001, the conference will
              be held in Asia for the first time.  The first eight conferences have produced
              highly desirable interactions between academic and industrial and government
              workers in this vital area of chemical process design and simulation.  The
              meetings have also become the most important gathering for workers from all
              over the world; the Eighth conference  held in 1998 in Nordwijkerhout, The
              Netherlands attracted 250 participants from 29 countries.  Each conference has
              produced important collections of papers in review  archival proceeding
              volumes. The Eighth Conference provided over 1000 pages of reviews  and new
              research published in the international journal Fluid Phase Equilibria.

The
              Ninth Conference is scheduled for May 20 -25 2001, in Kurashiki, Japan, with a
              similar format that has been successful at the previous Conferences, though
              with some significant enhancements in workshops and new session topics.

The
              present proposal requests funds for travel, and meals and lodging in some
              cases, for as many needy US academic researchers as possible.  A small request
              is included for communications costs between them and the PI.  Those supported
              would include presenters of invited and contributed papers as well as young
              research workers who would not be able to attend without such support.  No
              request is made for meeting organization expenses or for non-US participants.
