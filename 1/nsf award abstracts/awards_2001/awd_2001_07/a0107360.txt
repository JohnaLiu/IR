The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.

This award will provide 12 months of support
              to Dr. Steven N. Francoeur to work with Dr. Barry J. F. Biggs at the National
              Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research in Christchurch, New Zealand.
              

The PI will conduct coupled field and laboratory investigations of the
              effects of low-intensity flood events on stream periphyton and invertebrates. 
              The overall objectives of this work are to 1) discover patterns in the biotic
              communities of natural streams related to low-intensity flood events by using
              time-series sampling and correlative analyses, and 2) test the causal role of
              low-intensity floods in generating these patterns by conducting manipulative
              experiments in large, outdoor artificial streams.  He expects that
              low-intensity flood events may cause quite different biological responses than
              high-intensity floods, perhaps even resulting in increased biomass or
              productivity.  Working in New Zealand with Dr. Biggs provides an ideal setting
              because of the great number of streams with differing flood regimes in a small
              geographical area, and they already have an artificial stream facility for
              experimental work, plus, Dr. Biggs leads a highly productive research team
              specializing in investigation of the role of flood events in stream
              ecosystems.
