     The investigator studies ways to estimate the average
              amount
of selection for or against new mutations at a particular
              genetic
locus using information contained in aligned DNA or
              protein
sequences.  If the estimated amount of selection is
              significantly
negative, this is an indication that the region is
              under
stabilizing selection and may have an important biological
function. 
              If the estimated average amount of selection is
positive, then new variants in
              this region are favored, as is
common for some immune system genes.  Models
              that allow random
variation of the amounts of selection over sites are
              also
considered.  The methods studied are computationally easy to carry
out
              and have easily obtained significance levels, but assume
statistical
              independence between polymorphic sites instead of the
more usual assumption of
              tight linkage.  Studies have shown in
many cases that short-segment gene
              conversion and recombination
act at a greater rate than point mutation, so
              that tight linkage
is not always a reasonable assumption.  Simulations are
              carried
out to test the assumption that small to moderate amounts of
              gene
conversion and recombination are sufficient to guarantee
              enough
independence between sites so that the proposed estimators will
have
              desirable statistical properties.  The models are applied to
aligned sequences
              from public databases.  They are also applied to
human SNP datasets, for which
              the assumption of sitewise
independence is clearer.
     Recent advances in
              biology have made a vast amount of data
available about the human genome and
              about the genomes of other
species.  Tools for understanding the significance
              of this data,
and in particular the significance of variation in this
              data
between individuals, have lagged behind.  One question is whether
new
              genetic variants at a particular genetic locus (or segment of
DNA) have been
              favored on the average in the past, have rendered
their owners less fit, or
              have had essentially the same effect on
the fate of individuals with those DNA
              variants.  Tests are
proposed that give a computationally easy way of
              determining
which of these three cases applies at a particular genetic
              locus.
These tests are based on the configurations of variant sites in
DNA
              from several individuals at that locus.  The results of this
test can give
              information about the function of this stretch of
DNA.  They can also give
              information about how a particular gene
is affected by or is currently being
              affected by evolution.
Information from related biological species can give
              further
information.  The difficulty of the proposed methods is that
              they
assume that different portions of the genetic locus are
              evolving
approximately independently.  For some genetic data (for
              example,
SNP for "single-nucleotide polymorphism" data) this can generally
be
              assumed.  The sensitivity of the proposed methods to this
independence
              assumption for non-SNP data is tested.
