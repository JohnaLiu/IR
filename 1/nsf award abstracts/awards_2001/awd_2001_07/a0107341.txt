The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will support a six-month postdoctoral research
              fellowship  by Dr. Jason T. DeJong to work with Dr. Mark Randolph at the
              University of Western Australia in Nedlands, West Australia.

Deep
              foundations are being constructed at an ever increasing rate in regions with
              cemented sand deposits throughout the world.  However, current empirical design
              methods perform inadequately, and thus advances must be made to improve design
              performance.  Before advanced computer modeling methods can be properly
              implemented, the mechanisms governing deep foundation behavior must be
              understood and incorporated into models.  This project will investigate these
              mechanisms and provide a preliminary framework for modeling deep foundations in
              cemented soils.

The University of Western Australia is one of the premier
              institutions in the design of deep foundations.  The host is a leading
              authority in the field of deep foundations.
