Abstract    :
              The project will investigate ways of making robots more user-friendly via an
              innovative approach whereby the robot will be able to recognized the affecting
              state of the interacting human and modify it's (robot's) own actions to make
              the human feel comfortable to work with the robot. Wearable biofeedback sensors
              will be used to measure a variety of physiological indices to infer the
              underlying affective human states.
