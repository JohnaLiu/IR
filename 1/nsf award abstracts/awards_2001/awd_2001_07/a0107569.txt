Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2001.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Phylogenetic analysis using ribosomal RNA structure."  Ribosomal RNA genes are
              widely used in phylogenetics and have shaped current views of the history of
              life. Traditional DNA-sequence-based  phylogenetic phylogenetic methods,
              however, fail to reliably place highly divergent sequences.  This research
              develops probabilistic models for phylogenetics that are based on rRNA
              structure.
