Title:  NGS:  Virtual
              Worlds and Simulation Conference (VWSIM'01)

Over the last several years,new
              advances have been made in creating collaborative virtual places, populated by
              both intelligent agents and human players.  Unlike the usual homogenous
              simulation system, part of the strength of a Virtual World (VW) is its ability
              to become the common meeting ground for a variety of different types of
              computer-based processing capabilities.  During January 7-11, the Society for
              Computer Simulation will hold its fourth Virtual Worlds and Simulation
              Conference (VWSim'01) in Phoenix, Arizona.  Although this conference has always
              been noted for its diversity, this year we are making a special effort to bring
              in several users of distance education amd telemedicine.  The requested funds
              will support researchers in the areas such as distance education and distance
              medical projects, teachers and healthcare practioners who will report on
              ongoing VW projects in The Navajo nation and in rural Alaska.
