Title: Special
              Projects:  The Recruitment and Retention of Faculty and Graduates Students in
              Computer Science and Engineering.

This award to the Computing Research
              Association (CRA) provides funds to support a significant study of the current
              problems of recruitment and retention of graduate students and faculty in
              computing research fields.  The project is collecting and analyzing data and
              information on the subject, will develop suggested actions for interested
              agencies and other organizations to take, and will establish means to collect
              the data and information on an ongoing basis so that it will be on hand as
              problems arise in the future.  The study group consists of twelve to fifteen
              qualified individuals selected from various areas of the computing research
              community.
