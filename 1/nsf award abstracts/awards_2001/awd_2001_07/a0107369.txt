The International Research Fellow Awards Program
              enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.
This award will provide eight months of
              support to Dr. Violetta L. Cavalli-Sforza to do research with Dr. Abdelhadi
              Soudi of Ecole Nationale de L'Industrie Minerale in Rabat, Morocco on an
              investigation of alternative approaches in Arabic-English/French machine
              translation.
The research proposed is first, computational morphology of
              Arabic for analysis and generation and the second is the development of a
              multi-engine machine translation for combining and comparing alternative
              approaches to Arabic-English/French machine translation.  Arabic is one of the
              world's major languages, used by approximately 260 million people in about
              twenty countries in North Africa and the Middle East as the primary language. 
              It is also used as a second language by approximately 1.3 billion people in
              areas including Africa and southeastern Asia.  It is gaining in importance for
              political, strategic and business reasons.

Dr. Soudi is assistant professor
              at the Center for Languages and Communication and the Computer Science
              Department at the Ecole Nationale de l'Industrie Minerale.
