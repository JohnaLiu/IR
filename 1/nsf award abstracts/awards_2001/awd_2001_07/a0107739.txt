Abstract    :
              Relaxations and diffusion play an important role in many branches of science,
              technology and engineering.  Relaxation phenomena occur widely in physics,
              biophysics, chemistry, materials science, metallurgy, rheology, glass sciences,
              polymer/biopolymer physics and engineering, colloids, fiber optics,
              opto-electronics and electronics.  It is the primary concern in basic physics
              as well as in very practical applications.  The wide variety of areas in which
              relaxation enters into consideration demonstrates its interdisciplinary nature.
               Research finding in the last decade have shown common features of relaxation
              phenomena in different materials that are often studied separately in different
              specialised and isolated fields.  This remarkable commonality of properties of
              relaxation in complex materials suggests an exciting opportunity for rapid
              development in all the specialised fields by a multidisciplinary
              approach.

Recognising the importance of providing a channel of
              communication between workers on relaxation phenomena in different materials
              and fields and the benefit it will bring to many research disciplines, a
              "Discussion Meeting on Relaxations in Complex Systems" is being organised in
              Crete, Greece, June 18th - 26th , 2001.  The objective of this NSF support is
              to help young and other investigators from academia in the United States to pay
              for the registration fee and, if there is sufficient money, part of the travel
              cost for attending this International Discussion Meeting.
