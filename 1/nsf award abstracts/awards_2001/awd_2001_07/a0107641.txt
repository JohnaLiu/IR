Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              techniques and equipment for simple, cheap and reliable mass production of
              triploid and tetraploid giant tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) using a new
              technology called Automated Polyploid Induction System (APIS).  This
              proprietary APIS system uses a specially designed spawning tank, an automated
              spawn sensing device and computer applied shock treatments. The specific
              objective of the Phase I project is to determine the optimal values of the
              three key parameters for triploidy induction in P. monodon:  time to start
              shock application, shock intensity, and shock duration. This determination will
              allow the complete development and demonstration of APIS during Phase II of the
              project.  Additional objectives in Phase II will include production of
              tetraploid P. monodon, and completion of production trials with diploid,
              triploid and tetraploid shrimp. 

The commercial application of this project
              is in the farmed shrimp production market. Farmed shrimp from Asia constitutes
              approximately 75% of the world's farmed shrimp production, and P. monodon
              accounts for greater than 50% of that production.  Successful mass production
              of the triploid P. monodon, and demonstration of superior culture performance
              of triploids will allow marketing of this proprietary technology throughout
              Asia.
