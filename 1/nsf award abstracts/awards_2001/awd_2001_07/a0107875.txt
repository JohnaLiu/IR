This award supports James Reynolds of Duke University and
              junior and senior researchers from various U.S. universities to participate in
              a workshop on assessment of the ecological, meteorological, and human
              dimensions of global desertification.  Desertification is the result of a
              complex mixture of causes, including over-cultivation, overgrazing, fuel
              gathering, and climate variability.  In areas affected, many perceive that the
              capacity of the land to support human populations, livestock, and wild
              herbivores has thereby been substantially reduced.  Although much international
              effort has addressed this problem, many uncertainties and misconceptions still
              exist.  A major challenge is to come up with a synthetic assessment framework
              for identifying what matters where and when in order to extrapolate results
              from studies in one area to other regions.  To meet that challenge, the present
              workshop will focus directly on the synthetic framework and on forging working
              collaborations with international researchers from different disciplines. 
              Especially important is that scientists recognize the need for new
              interdisciplinary approaches for addressing the pressing global problem of
              desertification and seek to explore a new paradigm for a synthetic framework
              that goes beyond regional concerns.
