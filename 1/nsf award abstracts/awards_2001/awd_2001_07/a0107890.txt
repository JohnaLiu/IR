Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funding to study radon radiation level at the Homestake Mine
              and to gather information that the National Underground Laboratory Committee
              needs for converting the Homestake Mine to a National Laboratory.  The tasks
              SDSMT proposes have to be done this calendar year because the Mine closes by
              January 1 of 2002.  After that time, access to the mine is impossible.
