Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2001.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Modeling Muscle Force Generation during Posture and Locomotion."  This project
              involves developing models of muscle force generation. The hypothesis being
              tested is that, during functional conditions, whole muscle models can be
              constructed by summing responses of constituent motor units. Specific aims are
              to test this hypothesis experimentally and to use nonlinear system
              identification to generate a database of single motor unit models.
