Abstract    :
              The research described in this proposal is aimed at discovering how animals are
              able to see their surroundings. In order to see it is necessary for the eye to
              convert light into an electrical signal that can then be processed by the
              brain. The eye contains specialized cells, called photoreceptors, which convert
              light into an electrical signal by producing a special chemical called IP3
              inside these special photoreceptor cells. IP3 can be thought of as a signal or
              a messenger inside of the photoreceptor cell. The photoreceptor cell also
              contains receivers that can respond to the IP3, and these receivers are called
              IP3 receptors. 

The eye is able to respond to light during a dark night as
              well as a bright sunny day. In order for this to occur the photoreceptor is
              able to decrease and increase the ability of the IP3 receptor to receive the
              signal from IP3. The research described in this proposal is aimed at
              understanding how the photoreceptor cell adjusts the ability of the IP3
              receptor to respond to the signal from IP3.

The information gained from this
              research will help us better understand how an eye is able to effectively
              respond to light over a very wide range of light intensities. This
              understanding is expected to help in the design of systems for artificial
              vision, which can be used to aid both man and machine.
