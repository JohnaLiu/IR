The International Research Fellow Awards Program
              enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of
              research abroad.  The Program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.

This award will support a twenty-four-month
              postdoctoral research fellowship for 
Dr. Anthony Aufdenkampe to work with Dr.
              Reynaldo L. Victoria and Dr. Alex V. Krusche of CENA and Dr. Ron Benner of the
              University of South Carolina.  Support for this project is coming from the
              Ecosystem Studies Program of the BIO Division and the U.S.-Brazil Program in
              the Division of International Programs.

These experiments are designed
              toward two objectives: (1) Develop empirical relationships of river metabolism
              as a function of water composition, discharge hydrograph, and sub-basin
              characteristics, to be immediately applicable to the first parameterization of
              the ROMBUS model.  (2) Interpret microbial organic matter transformations in
              rivers from the more detailed perspective of bioenergetics, which is the first
              step toward a more mechanistic parameterization of these processes.

The goal
              of the proposed research is to explore controls on rates of organic matter
              remineralization within the Amazon River system.  The benefit of this project
              is that it will advance the knowledge of our understanding of Amazon River
              basin, and river ecology as well as provide us with a better understanding of
              river metabolism and water composition.
