The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide twenty-four months of support to
              Dr. Jonathan R. Nitschke to work with Dr. Jean-Marie Lehn at the Universite
              Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg, France on new methods of programming the
              self-assembly of stacked porphyrazine structures.  This project is being
              co-funded with NSF's Math and Physical Sciences Directorate's Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities.
This project will involve working on new means
              of coaxing different porphyrin-like porphyrazine molecules to assemble into
              stacked structures.  Self-assembly instructions will be encoded into the
              molecules themselves, providing new techniques for use in the field of
              supramolecular chemistry. These stacked porphyrazine assemblies are anticipated
              to have applications in the areas of solar energy and chemosensing.
Dr. Lehn
              was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1987. He is best known for his
              investigations of the interplay of non-covalent forces in abiological systems. 
              A focus of his current research is the rational design of supramolecular
              assemblies.
