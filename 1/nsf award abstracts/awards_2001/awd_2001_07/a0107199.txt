The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and its
              parent body the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR)
              exemplify a national research organization that has enormous potential to
              positively impact SMET learning at all levels.  Excellent educational programs
              already bridging the research and education communities can be further
              leveraged to reach a diverse, interdisciplinary national and international
              education audience by collaborating with consortia of universities and colleges
              seeking closer ties to research institutions.  NCAR will host the "Earth System
              Education Partnerships with Research Institutions" workshop January 29-31, 2001
              in Boulder, CO.  The workshop will bring together a small group of Earth system
              education leaders with NCAR and UCAR personnel to engage in a strategic
              discussion of ways to enhance and expand research institution involvement with
              the education community.
