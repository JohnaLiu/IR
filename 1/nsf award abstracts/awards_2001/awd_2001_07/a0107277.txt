The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will provide twenty-four months of support to
              Dr. Myron Shekelle to work with Dr. Jatna Supriatna at the University of
              Indonesia in Depok, Indonesia.

This project is a study of the number of
              species and their distribution of tarsiers (small bodied, nocturnal primates),
              using genetic and acoustic data.  The PI will coordinate activities between
              Columbia University and the University of Indonesia to study the biogeography
              of all Sulawesi vertebrates and map regions of genetic endemism - with
              implications for conservation.

Dr. Supriatna is Director of the Center for
              the Study of Biodiversity and Conservation.  He is also the in-country program
              manager for Conservation International.
