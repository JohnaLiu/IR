Abstract    :
              This is a study of teaching learning science in three neighborhood high schools
              in Philadelphia, Pa.  The study seeks to understand the teaching and learning
              of science in terms of student use of their existing social and cultural
              capital to make sense of the activities they participate in during school and
              after school.  It would involve six teacher-researchers who are involved with a
              local systemic initiative in which the teachers are teaching courses in
              chemistry.  The schools are also involved with the Philadelphia's Urban
              Systemic Initiative.  The study would examine learning of science in different
              institutional settings "to ascertain how students and teachers interact to give
              meaning to their environment."  It will seek to learn how teachers in poor
              urban environments gain the respect of and build rapport with their students. 
              It will answer other questions such as, "when students act in ways that are
              resistant to the goals of the teacher, how do teachers adapt their teaching to
              provide opportunities."
