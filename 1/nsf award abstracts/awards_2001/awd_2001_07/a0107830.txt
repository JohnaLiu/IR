This award for travel support of U.S. participants in a
              U.S.-Switzerland Forum in NanoBioSciences, in Princeton, New Jersey, December
              14-15, 2000,  focuses on the role of nanoscience in biological sciences and
              materials.  The workshop will address:  (1) interdependence and synergism
              between scientific discovery and technology in nanoscale research in biological
              sciences and materials; (2) the path from fundamental discovery of new
              properties and phenomena to industrial applications; and (3) ways to facilitate
              and best utilize current and expected advances in nanobiosciences.  The
              workshop is organized by Ilhan A. Aksay and John T. Groves of the Princeton
              Materials Institute, University of Princeton and Hans Leuenberger, University
              of Basel and Beat Butz of the Swiss National Science Foundation.  The meeting
              will bring together leading U.S. and Swiss scientists, researchers in early
              stages of career development for the explicit purpose of identifying a research
              agenda and future collaborative activities.
