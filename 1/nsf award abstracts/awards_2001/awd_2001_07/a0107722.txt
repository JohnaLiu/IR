Abstract    :
              The purpose of the conference, to be held in Banff, Canada, September 30 through
              October 5, 2001, is to provide an interdisciplinary forum for emerging
              technologies related to microgravity research.  The effort will be directed
              towards bringing together scientists from the fluid, thermal, biological and
              materials sciences and exchange technical information on research related to
              transport processes in these disciplines.  In particular, the focus will be on
              complementing the technical expertise across these various areas, and exploring
              the avenues for interdisciplinary work. The growing interdisciplinary aspects
              of research in these different disciplines necessitates the sharing of
              expertise, and the proposed conference will provide the forum for focusing on
              new areas where experts will be able to blend their scientific ideas to deal
              with various unsolved scientific problems. The funds will help support travel
              for U.S. participants consisting of undergraduate and graduate students,
              post-doctoral fellows, and non-tenured faculty with limited research funding.
