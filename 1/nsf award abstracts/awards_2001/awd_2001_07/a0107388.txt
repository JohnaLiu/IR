     Mathematical and theoretical biology is a vital and
              rapidly
growing subject that complements empirical work and provides
model
              systems for study and manipulation.  Such model systems can
sometime suggest
              shortcuts when the experimetal work is
difficult.  More often, the models
              provide novel tools to disect
complex biological phenomena in addition to
              traditional
techniques.  The current challenge in the field is to
              make
quantitative modeling, on the one hand, a part of the process
              of
fundamental biological discovery, and, on the other hand,
applicable in
              biomedical and biotechnological situations.  This
requires researchers with
              biological skills and mathematical
insight and facility.  At this time such
              individuals are rare.
The investigator and his colleagues organize an
              International
Conference on Mathematical and Theoretical Biology at
              Hilo,
Hawaii on July 15--19, 2001.  The goals of the meeting are to
highlight
              current top-level research, to provide a perspective on
future research areas,
              to provide opportunities for career
development to junior researchers and
              underrepresented categories
of researchers, to foster interactions between
              established
researchers and junior researchers and between theorists
              and
experimentalists.  The meeting highlights exciting traditional
and new
              areas of rapid growth in mathematical biology, such as
theoretical ecology and
              evolution, quantitative cell biology,
proteomics, mathematical modeling in
              medicine and mathematical
physiology and immunology.  Plenary speakers both
              give a broad
overview of their field and focus on areas for future
              research.
Additional contributed and poster sessions are organized to
              give
junior researchers the chance to be heard.
     Mathematical and
              theoretical biology is a young
interdisciplinary field of science that
              provides quantitative
models in biology.  These models provide novel tools to
              disect
complex biological phenomena.  The current challenge in the field
is
              to train researchers with biological skills and mathematical
insight and
              facility.  The conference helps to highlight current
top-level research and
              provides opportunities for career
development to junior researchers and
              underrepresented categories
of researchers.
