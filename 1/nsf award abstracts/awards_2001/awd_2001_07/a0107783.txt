This award supports U.S.
              participants (invited speakers, young researchers, and graduate students) in
              the Fifth Mississippi State Conference on Differential Equations &
              Computational Simulations on  May 18-19, 2001.  The objective of the conference
              is to provide a forum where mathematicians, scientists, and engineers from
              academia and industry can exchange ideas concerning theoretical, applied, and
              computational developments in differential equations and associated
              simulations.  The conference is the fifth in a series of biennial meetings on
              the subject.
 
With the rapid development of high performance computing and
              communication, and robust and efficient mathematical/numerical algorithms,
              computational simulation has emerged as an essential tool for engineering
              analysis and design environment.  This has fundamentally
changed the way
              underlying principles of science and engineering are applied to
              research,
design, and development.  These computational simulations involve
              (i) a system of differential
equations representative of the physical
              phenomena (mathematical model); (ii) a numerical
method to simulate the
              mathematical model; and (iii) an efficient
              sequential/parallel/distributed
computing environment.  Successful simulations
              require interdisciplinary collaboration between various scientific and
              engineering fields. This conference is an opportunity for workers in these
              fields to discuss important recent results.
