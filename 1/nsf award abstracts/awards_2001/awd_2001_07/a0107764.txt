This award will fund travel and related expenses for a group of
              US chemistry researchers to participate in a workshop on supra-molecular
              chemistry.  The workshop will be part of the Fourth International Chemical
              Congress that will take place April 16-20, 2001 in Havana, Cuba.  The Congress
              this year is co-sponsored by several agencies within Cuba and by the
              International Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry, and the International 
              Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

The supra-molecular workshop,
              organized by Dr. John Malin and Dr. Luis Echegoyen for the American Chemical
              Society, will be coordinated with Professors Luis Montero and Robert Cao, of
              the University of Havana.  The immediate objective is to improve communication
              among chemical scientists in the Americas, with the ultimate goal of
              strengthening ties and developing collaborations in the area of supra-molecular
              chemistry among chemists in the hemisphere.  The workshop will feature
              internationally renowned scientists who will present cutting-edge results,
              ranging from very basic developments to more applied topics in the field.
