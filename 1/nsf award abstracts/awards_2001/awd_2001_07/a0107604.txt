Ecologists have long hypothesized that herbivore
              pressure is more intense and that plant defenses are better developed towards
              the tropics than at higher latitudes.  Although some indirect evidence supports
              these ideas, the large geographic scale of the problem has hampered attempts at
              more direct studies.  My recent work in Atlantic coast salt marshes directly
              demonstrated that southern marsh plants are less palatable to herbivores than
              are northern plants of the same species.  The current project will test the
              hypothesis that herbivore pressure in these communities is greater at lower
              than at higher latitudes.  Herbivore pressure will be assessed by planting
              "standard" plants into marshes in each geographic region and observing
              herbivore damage, and by herbivore counts.  A second goal of the project will
              be to determine whether the plants require cues such as climate or herbivore
              damage in order to develop latitudinal differences in palatability, or whether
              these differences are "pre-programmed".  These alternatives will be compared by
              growing plants from both geographic regions side by side in a common
              greenhouse.  By overcoming several of the logistical problems that have plagued
              past studies, this project will bring a new level of rigor and understanding to
              the study of latitudinal gradients in plant palatability.
