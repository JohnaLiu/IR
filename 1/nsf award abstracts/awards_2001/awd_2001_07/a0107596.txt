Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2001.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Inferring the nature of quantitative genetic variation:  methods for
              integrating single and multi-locus analyses."  The goal of this project is to
              extend quantitative genetic theory to the study of individual genes, and then
              to use that theory to develop methods for analyzing sequence polymorphism data
              from quantitative trait loci (QTL).  This theoretical framework allows the
              testing of hypotheses about the nature of genetic variation.
