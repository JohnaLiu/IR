Abstract    :
              This project includes organization of a workshop to be conducted by NSF with
              support from
WTEC, Inc. for a preliminary assessment of U.S. and international
              R&D activities in spin
electronics. This topic has been identified by NSF's
              Engineering Directorate as the focus of a
potential NSF/ENG research study.
              The purpose of the workshop, to be held December 14, 2001,
is to gather facts
              and opinions from experts from the U.S. research community on how
              this
emerging area of research should be defined for purposes of such a study,
              to provide an overview
of U.S. and international R&D activities that fall
              within this definition. This information
presented at the workshop will be
              distilled into a report for NSF/ENG.
