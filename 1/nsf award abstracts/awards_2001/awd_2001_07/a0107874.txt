Abstract    :
              This project is mainly concerned with the study of the regularity of
solutions
              of partial differential equations that arise in the theory of
several complex
              variables and on CR manifolds.  In particular we plan to
study various
              properties of subelliptic multipliers and also
hypoellipticity when
              subellipticity fails. Related questions are Hoelder
continuity and real
              analyticity of solutions. We also will continue our
study of global regularity
              on CR manifolds using microlocal methods.

Partial differential equations
              arise naturally in physics, chemistry,
engineering, economics, and in several
              diverse areas of mathematics.
Sometimes these equations can be solved
              explicitly but more often they
cannot and, in that case, the problem is to
              find whether the solution
exists and if so to find various of its properties
              and to approximate
it. This is accomplished by means of estimates. Here we
              study estimates
for certain special fundamental partial differential equations
              but the
techniques we develop are applicable in much greater generality.
              The
basic concept that we use are "subelliptic multipliers" this is a
              tool
which converts the search for estimates into problems of algebra
              and
geometry.  This concept has proved very effective not only in
              proving
estimates but also in the study of various algebraic and
              geometric
problems.
