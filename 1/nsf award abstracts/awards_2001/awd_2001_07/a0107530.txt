Abstract    :
              0107530

Funding is provided as travel grants for the participation of about
              20 scientists from lesser developed countries to attend the upcoming
              International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Ocean  and
              International Association for Biological Oceanography (IAPSO/IABO) Joint
              Assembly in Mar del Plata, Argentina.  The target audience for support is
              scientists from Latin America, Africa, the Indian sub-continent and the Former
              Soviet Union. The travel grants will emphasize partial support for registration
              fees, on-site subsidence, and partial travel support in that order.
