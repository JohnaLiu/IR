Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for a research starter grant to assist a recipient of
              an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology in establishing an
              independent research program after obtaining a tenure-traack position at an
              eligible institution in the United States.  Funds are being used to provide
              supplies and equipment for research on fundamental and molecular aspects of
              microbial diversity and symbiosis.  Specifically, the mechanism and impact of
              the microbial degradation of bacterial signaling compounds in vitro and in
              soils will be examined, as will the form, function, and phylogeny of microbes
              associated with termite hindguts.
