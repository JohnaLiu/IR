Plants can recognize gene products produced by pathogens,
              and this recognition triggers a strong defensive response that severely limits
              the pathogen's growth in the plant.  An important question in the area of plant
              disease, is "Why do pathogens carry genes which ultimately trigger a defense
              response against them"?  In this Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant, the
              researchers propose to look for benefits associated with the pathogen genes
              that elicit plant defenses.  They propose to take a plant pathogenic bacteria
              and remove several of the elicitor genes, and then compare the performance of
              the original strains (which have all the genes) to the mutant strain (which
              possesses a subset of the genes).   The researchers will investigate several
              factors including disease pathology, epidemiology, and survival, under both
              greenhouse and natural field conditions.  

Agriculture and the plant
              biotechnology industry are very interested in pathogen defense elicitor genes. 
              It is now possible to engineer plants to express new resistance genes that
              recognize the elicitor genes of common plant pathogens.  Before such a strategy
              is attempted, it would be valuable to understand how the elicitor genes
              function and are maintained in pathogen populations.  If elicitor genes can be
              removed with little or no fitness cost to the pathogens, then a biotechnology
              strategy that depends on the expression of elicitor genes can easily fail.
