Abstract    :
              This project will start a long term collaboration between the mathematics
              department and the biology department at the University of Colorado-Boulder. 
              There is a tremendous amount of physiological data on the Mouthner nerve cell
              that has been collected in the past twenty five years.  This project will start
              the development of a sophisticated mathematical and computational model of this
              cell that will incorporate the known data.  New computational methods will be
              developed for massively parallel computers to model the
dynamics of this nerve
              cell.  It is intended that this project will start a significant program in
              computational neuroscience that will become an option for the Ph.D. program in
              neuroscience at the University of Colorado.  In addition, the undergraduate
              research program that this project grew from  will continue to engage
              undergraduates in research in computational neuroscience.  This IGMS project is
              jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and
              the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
