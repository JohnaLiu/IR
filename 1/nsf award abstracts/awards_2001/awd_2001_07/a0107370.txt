The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide twenty-four months of support to
              Dr. Aysha L. Prather to work with Dr. Douglas C. Currie at the Royal Ontario
              Museum's Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Biology in Toronto, Ontario
              in Canada.
This project supports a phylogenetic and taxonomic study of a
              family of caddisflies (Trichoptera) that includes a large number of tropical
              species.  The research will produce a phylogeny-based definition of these taxa
              and resolve taxonomic questions within a tropical genus.  The work will be done
              at the Royal Ontario Museum under the supervision of Dr. Douglas Currie, a
              Trichoptera and Diptera systematist who has worked extensively in Southeast
              Asia.
