     The investigator develops new computer algorithms
              for
particle simulations in fluid dynamics and molecular dynamics,
and he
              employs the algorithms to study important application
problems.  The main
              technical tool is a new adaptive treecode
algorithm for solving the N-body
              problem in the context of
long-range particle interactions.  In this
              algorithm, the particle
forces or velocities are evaluated using Taylor
              approximation in
Cartesian coordinates, and the necessary Taylor coefficients
              are
computed by a recurrence relation.  The adaptive features include
a
              divide-and-conquer evaluation strategy, nonuniform rectangular
clusters,
              variable order approximation, and a run-time choice
between Taylor
              approximation and direct summation.  The
investigator develops an optimal
              strategy for choosing the
parameters in the code, in order to maximize the
              accuracy and
efficiency of the algorithm.  The application problems to
              be
studied in fluid dynamics include the onset of chaotic dynamics
in vortex
              cores, high precision computation of vortex sheet
roll-up and spiral formation
              in the Kelvin-Helmholtz problem, and
breakdown and transition in vortex rings.
               An important component
of the work is to compare regularized particle
              simulations with
experiments and with genuine viscous flows computed by
              finite
difference schemes.  The application problems to be studied
              in
molecular dynamics involve potential energy and force field
evaluation for
              electrostatic interactions.
     The results of this research affect several
              areas of
strategic national interest, including civil and military
aviation
              and biotechnology.  One outstanding problem in aviation
is the simulation of
              the trailing vortex wake that forms behind
an aircraft on takeoff and landing.
               The vortex wake is a serious
hazard to other aircraft, especially in crowded
              airports.  It
imposes a minimum time and distance between takeoffs and
              landings
on a given runway, and it is a source of wind shear, which has
been
              implicated in accidents.  The project sheds light on the
structure and
              dynamics of vortex cores, and this helps
aeronautical engineers in designing
              vortex wake remediation
systems.  In the area of biotechnology, one
              far-reaching problem
is to simulate protein folding in a physically accurate
              way.  This
is in fact the next step required to make use of the
              data
collected in the human genome project.  The project contributes
              by
enhancing the computer algorithms that are used by biochemists to
study
              protein folding.  In the area of education and human
resources, the
              investigator directs an applied honors calculus
course for freshman science
              and engineering students, develops a
new graduate course on scientific
              computing, and mentors the
professional development of undergraduate and
              graduate students
and postdocs.
