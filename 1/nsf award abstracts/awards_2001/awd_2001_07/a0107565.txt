Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2001.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Ab-initio prediction of membrane protein structure."  Membrane proteins which
              play important roles in cell function are not as well-studied as soluble
              proteins.  This research develops automated or semi-automated computational
              methods for predicting the structures of integral membrane proteins using
              publicly available data and constructs an online database of structure
              predications.  In doing so, it brings together information from protein folding
              theory, the human genome project, and mutagenesis experiments on membrane
              proteins in a unique way.
