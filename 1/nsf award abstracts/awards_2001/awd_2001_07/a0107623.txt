Abstract    :
              This project is aimed at developing a VLSI-like design methodology for
              Nano-electro-mechanical Systems (NEMS). Specifically, computer-aided design 
              (CAD) tools are being developed for functional and compact modeling of
              nano-electro-mechanical devices. Unlike macroscopic and some microscopic
              devices, where continuum physical principles are valid, at nanoscales it is
              important to account for granular nature of the devices. A multiscale approach
              combining the lowest level atomistic approaches to the highest-level continuum
              theories are being developed for functional modeling of NEMS. The development
              of compact models is being investigated to enable design of large and
              interconnected-array of NEM devices. Finally, carbon nanotube based NEMS are
              being investigated as basic building blocks for nanoscale sensors, actuators,
              devices and systems.
