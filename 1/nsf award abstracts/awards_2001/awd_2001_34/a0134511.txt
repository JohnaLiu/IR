The objective of the proposed research is to develop techniques to
              significantly increase terpenoid indole alkaloid (TIA) production from cell
              cultures of C. roseus.  The proposed hypothesis is that to maximize the
              production of secondary metabolites such as TIAs, the relative flows of
              precursors and energy resources at various levels must be balanced.  The
              proposed specific aims for achieving this balance for increasing TIA production
              are to: (1) increase flux to both primary and secondary metabolism, (2)
              maximize the metabolic flux to TIA production while maintaining an appropriate
              metabolic flux to cellular machinery for supporting essential cellular
              activities, (3) tune the flux between the glycolysis, citric acid, and pentose
              phosphate pathways for maximum secondary metabolite production, and (4)
              characterize the optimum balance the various pathways and activities.  This
              research could produce results to increase the yield of important antitumor and
              antihypertensive compounds.
