Abstract    :
              The focus of this integrated research, education, and outreach program is the
              development of simulation tools capable of modeling the complex electromagnetic
              environment of high-speed circuits. Key innovations include the use of
              multi-scale abstraction and introduction of meta-elements to minimize the
              computational burden. The finite element method is used as a back-bone approach
              to allow for complex geometrical and material features. This simulation tool
              will be used, along with other educational materials developed by the Principal
              Investigator, to develop a Mixed Signal Circuits course at Michigan State
              University that focuses on electromagnetic interference (EMI) mitigation and
              design for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC).

The educational materials
              developed for consumption on the MSU campus will be adapted for distance
              learning via the Asynchronous Learning Network. Flexible short courses will be
              offered over the Internet to industrial and life-long learning students. The
              target audience for this outreach effort are degreed-professionals desiring
              EMI/EMC education for mixed signal circuit design. Student learning tracks will
              be customized based on the needs of the student and their company. Several
              major companies have indicated interest in collaborating in this effort and
              their input will assist the Principal Investigator in the production of a
              high-quality, high-impact outreach program.
