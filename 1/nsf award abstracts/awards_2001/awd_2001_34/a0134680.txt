Abstract    :
              The American Museum of the Moving Image is refurbishing the traveling exhibit,
              "Behind the Screen:  Making Motion Pictures and Television."  The exhibit,
              which focuses on the science and technology underlying movies and television,
              opened at the World Financial Center in New York City and subsequently traveled
              to the Kulturhuset in Stockholm, Sweden and the Technisches Museum in Vienna,
              Austria.  It  currently is at the Exploratorium in San Francisco and is
              scheduled to travel to COSI Toledo, Ohio in October 2001.  The American Museum
              of the Moving Image has requests for the exhibit from the Science City, Kansas
              City; the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia; and the Museum of Science, Boston. 
              However, in order for the exhibit to travel to venues beyond the Exploratorium,
              it needs to be refurbished and upgraded.  This grant provides the funds for the
              exhibit to remain viable and to travel to additional venues.
