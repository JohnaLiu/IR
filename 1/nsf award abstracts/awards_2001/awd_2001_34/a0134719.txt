Abstract    :
              This project aims in applying in-situ transmission electron microscopy under
              ultra high vacuum conditions to develop a fundamental understanding of the
              oxidation processes at the nanoscale. Major objectives of the proposed study is
              to develop better understanding of the nanoscale stages of oxidation from the
              nucleation of the metal oxide to the formation of thermodynamically stable
              oxide. Systematic experimental studies will be made on thin films of copper and
              aluminum. The project involves collaborations with the Materials Research
              Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), Lawrence
              Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and the Institute for Materials Research
              and Engineering (IMRE), Singapore where a specialized in situ chamber for Al
              thin film deposition inside the UHV-TEM exist. This research has technological
              relevance where surface oxidation processes play critical roles in
              environmental stability, high temperature corrosion, electrochemistry,
              catalytic reactions, gate oxides and thin film growth as well as fuel
              reactions. The educational component incorporates the research tools developed
              in the project in the development of new courses at both the undergraduate and
              graduate levels in materials science and engineering (MS&E) curriculum as well
              as a new web site accessible for public.

The research develops a new
              understanding of the fundamental processes involved in nanoscale oxidation on
              thin metals that would have direct relevance in technologies where corrosion is
              the limiting factor.
