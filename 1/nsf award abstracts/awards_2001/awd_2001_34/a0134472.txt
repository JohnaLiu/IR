Abstract    :
              The focus of this research  is to develop methodology for the preparation of
              porphyrins with fused pyrene rings and to test the potential for using pyrene
              as a platform for connecting fused porphyrin rings. In parallel studies, the
              synthesis, characterization and chemistry of carbaporphyrins will be
              investigated. Other macrocyclic systems, including tropiporphyrin, will be
              synthesized using "3+1" methodology  and "4+1" methodology will be used to
              prepare carba-analogues of expanded porphyrins.  Undergraduate students will be
              involved at all stages of the research.

With this renewal Research in
              Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program is supporting the research efforts of Dr. Timothy D. Lash of
              the Department of Chemistry at Illinois State University.  Dr. Lash will focus
              his work on the preparation of porphyrin-like chromophores and related dimeric
              or oligomeric systems.  Porphyrins are a class of brightly colored heterocycles
              that serve a variety of functions in nature and the synthesis of analogues
              opens new avenues for the preparation of compounds with potentially interesting
              properties.  The work will be carried out with the collaboration of
              undergraduate and masters level graduate students.
