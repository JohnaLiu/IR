Under this CAREER Award, methods from theoretical and
              computational mechanics will be combined with pattern theory to directly
              incorporate medical image data into the analysis of deforming biological
              tissues.  Results will provide new finite-element based tools that use image
              data to track three-dimensional kinematics and nonlinear strain in deforming
              tissues and to register anatomical structures appearing in image data sets. 
              Two applications would be targeted: in vivo measurement of strains in the
              beating human heart and in situ measurement of strains in ligaments.  The
              techniques and resulting software, which will be made available to the public,
              are expected to be applicable in numerous other areas including geophysics,
              manufacturing engineering design, biology and computational medicine.  

The
              educational component focuses on three areas:  bioengineering outreach to Utah
              high school students through a summer institute; developing an integrated
              biomechanics curriculum built around three core courses, and training
              undergraduate and graduate students in conjunction with research objectives.
