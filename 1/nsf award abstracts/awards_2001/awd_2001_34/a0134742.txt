Abstract    :
              This award will support the creative integration of paleoclimate research and
              educational outreach to better understand the interplay of low- and
              high-latitude climate processes in Earth's natural climate evolution and to
              describe this interplay in a manner useful to social scientists engaged in the
              economic and policy aspects of global climate change. 

In general, the
              researcher will use a series of numerical experiments to examine how orbital
              forcing of low latitude tropical climates might impact high latitude ice sheet
              growth during the Quaternary Ice Ages and the occurrence of climatic events
              such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).  Specifically, the researcher
              will pursue a scientific strategy to investigate the physical processes
              involved in the response of the tropical climate to orbital forcing, compare
              purely orbital signatures with glacial stage signatures in tropical climate,
              investigate the relative effects of orbital and glacial forcing on variability
              within tropical climates, and investigate how the telconnection between low and
              high latitudes might be altered as the mean climate state changes (i.e., when
              ice cover and atmospheric levels of CO2 change).

The researcher's long-term
              scientific goals are complemented by a near-term educational goal of
              contributing a quantitative paleoclimatic perspective to the development of a
              university-wide undergraduate course covering the scientific, economic, and
              social aspects of climate change.
