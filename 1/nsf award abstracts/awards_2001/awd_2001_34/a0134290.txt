Abstract    :
              The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this award to
              Louisianan State University.  With this Career award, Professor David Spivak
              will design, synthesize, process and characterize polymer monolayers with
              imprinted recognition and transduction sites. Surfactant diacetylene monomers
              with different head groups will be ordered and oriented at the air-water
              interface with proteins in the water sub-phase to provide recognition sites for
              the monomers before they are polymerized by ultraviolet radiation.  Reversible
              signal transduction in response to binding/unbinding of analytes will be
              detected directly by the polymer monolayer by colorimetric, electrochemical,
              uv-visible or fluorescence methods, and these monolayers may be developed to
              devices and sensors for specific biological and chemical detection. The PI with
              the support from the department will develop a multidisciplinary program in
              nanoscale sciences with special emphases on Chemistry, Biology and Engineering.
               In addition, a new Macromolecular Studies program with teaching and hand-on
              laboratory courses will be reactivated and offered to both graduate and
              undergraduate students.     

Monolayers based on polydiacetylene with
              different head groups will be designed, synthesized, processed and
              characterized for potential application in bio- and chemical-sensors and
              devices.  In addition, these monolayers with specific recognition sites for
              analytes will have reversible signal transduction properties and signal may be
              processed by colorimetric, electrochemical, uv-visible or fluorescence methods.
               As part of the education program, a multidisciplinary program with training
              and research opportunities will be offered to both graduate and undergraduate
              students.
