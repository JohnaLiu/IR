Abstract    :
              This CAREER combines research and educational activities in several areas of
              quantum information theory.  The principle goals are to develop methods for
              accurate, coherent quantum state manipulation of strongly interacting systems
              in quantum optics and atomic, molecular condensed matter physics.  The main
              thrusts are; quantum state control in mesoscopic systems and atom interactions
              mediated by optical photons.  A graduate course on open quantum systems and the
              physics of quantum information will be developed and outreach activities fo
              high school and the general public will be developed and presented.
