              Abstract

S. Bose, Washington State University

The PI proposes
              to investigate the synthesis of calcium phosphate based ceramic nano-podwers
              and its use in the development of bioactive bone implants of improved
              mechanical properties. 

The proposal includes a very well planned
              /structured research plan addressing key aspects from the synthesis of the
              material (nanopowders) to processing of various composites for implants, to the
              detailed physical/mechanical and biological characterization. 

The proposal
              brings a variety of skills to the project, all very well integrated. An entire
              interdisciplinary program/plan seems to be associated with this proposal. The
              PI is a very active outstanding young faculty who has a multidisciplinary
              background, interacts with researchers with various backgrounds and expertise,
              and is an expert herself on the main experimental techniques to be used within
              the proposed research activities. 

The research questions address in the
              research plan are highly relevant and the approaches are novel. The proposed
              level of characterization of mechanical properties of the implant
              materials/scaffolding materials is consistent with the current needs of the
              tissue engineering field. The results of this investigation may significantly
              contribute to the advancement in the development of scaffolds for bone tissue
              engineering.
