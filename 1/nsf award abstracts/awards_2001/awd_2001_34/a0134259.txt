Abstract    :
              The investigator and his colleagues
will address a number of
fundamental
              problems about
the geometry and arithmetic of moduli spaces:
What is the
              canonical model of the moduli space of curves of genus g?
Can one construct
              natural spaces that interpolate between the
canonical model and the moduli
              space of stable curves?
Can these be interpretted as moduli spaces in their
              own right?
Can one count the number of rational
points of moduli spaces of
              curves, bounded
with respect to various heights?  What are the
              natural
functions (effective divisors) one might use to specify
              these
heights?
What are the naturally defined strata
in the deformation
              space of a plane curve singularity?
How can one interpret blow-ups along such
              strata?

Algebraic geometry is the study of the solutions
to systems of
              polynomial equations.  Geometric
aspects of the solution sets translate into
              algebraic
properties of the equations, and vice versa.  This
approach has the
              advantage that computers can
manipulate equations very efficiently. 
              Promising
hypotheses can thus be checked on explicit examples.
Increasingly,
              computational approaches to geometry
are transforming the education of
              undergraduate
and graduate students, both in pure mathematics
and in related
              fields where mathematics is applied.
This emphasis on concrete examples and
              explicit computation
creates new research opportunities for young
              people,
especially those who have only just started to learn
the technical
              intricacies of the subject.
