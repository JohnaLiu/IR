Abstract    :
              

The theory of automatic control has reached considerable maturity
in the
              last few decades. Solutions to a large number of diverse
and challenging
              problems have been obtained, and many important
mathematical aspects of the
              theory are well understood. However,
there remain several categories of
              problems for which the success
of standard control tools has been limited.
              These include:

  1. Control of systems that cannot be stabilized by
              continuous
feedback.
  2. Control of systems with sensor or
              actuator
constraints.
  3. Control of systems with large-scale
              modeling
uncertainty.

   The research and educational development
              plan
proposed here is aimed at designing hybrid control
algorithms. In this
              framework, a continuous-time process is
controlled by means of logic-based
              switching among a family of
regulators. The closed-loop system is then called
              hybrid
because it combines continuous and discrete dynamics. We study
several
              situations in which such a control paradigm is natural and
helps overcome
              various shortcomings of more traditional control
methodologies.

The primary
              focus of this research is on systematic development of
tools for hybrid
              control design, applicable to general and useful
classes of nonlinear
              dynamical systems. We propose to achieve this
goal by recognizing common
              trends that unify different aspects of
the problems under consideration, and
              by exploiting recent
advances made by the proposer and collaborators in
              nonlinear
disturbance attenuation and in stability analysis of
              switched
systems.

Hybrid control techniques are suitable for implementation
              in the
context of many important applications that drive the
              modern
technology, such as software-enabled control, control over
networks,
              and vision-based control. These methods help bridge the
gap between the
              mathematical control theory and engineering
practice. For this reason, they
              also generate high student
interest. Our research program will be integrated
              into the
academic curriculum of the Electrical and Computer
              Engineering
Department of the University of Illinois at
              Urbana-Champaign
through course development, student mentoring,
              laboratory
creation, and tutorial publications.
