The objective of the proposed research is to develop greater
              understanding of lentivirus-cell interactions, with the long-range goal of
              developing improved lentivirues that will be useful for cystic fibrosis gene
              therapy.  Specifically, the goal of this research is to develop a targeted
              lentiviral vector and to examine the intracellular pathway that leads to
              maximal transfection.  The specific tasks of this research include: (1) the
              test of the hypothesis that lentivirus gene transfer can be improved by
              incorporating escort proteins into the lipid bilayer of the viruses, (2) the
              quantitative analysis of the effect of the escort proteins on infection, and
              (3) the engineering of lentiviruses to target receptors on the apical surfaces
              of polarized epithelial cells.  The knowledge gained from this research could
              help the design of the next generation of lentivirus vectors that would be
              useful for human gene therapy protocols.
