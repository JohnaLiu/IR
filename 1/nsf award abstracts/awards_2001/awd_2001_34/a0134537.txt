Description:  This award supports the US-India Cooperative
              Research: A New Approach to Boolean Division that can Trade Performance for
              Computation.  US PI Shared Seth, University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), Somenath
              Biswas, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK) and two of their graduate
              students will collaborate on solving an important logic synthesis problem in
              microelectronic design automation.  The investigators will decompose a large
              circuit into three smaller ones by using Boolean division to compute the two
              smaller circuits.  The objective is to develop a best path technique using
              approximate algorithms that trade-off performance with time.  The researchers
              will design and implement a single system that enables users to control the
              trade-off between computational efficiency and quality of output.  The results
              of the proposed research may find extensive use in multilevel Very Large-Scale
              Integrated (VLSI) circuit synthesis.    

Scope:  This project will enhance
              US infrastructure through the exchange of senior scientists and graduate
              students between UNL and IITK, one of India's foremost institutes for computer
              science.  The students will present findings at a well-established VLSI design
              conference in India; the PIs will publish final documentation in an archival
              journal.  The Office of International Science & Engineering and the Indian
              Department of Science and Technology (DST) support this activity under the
              NSF/DST joint program.
