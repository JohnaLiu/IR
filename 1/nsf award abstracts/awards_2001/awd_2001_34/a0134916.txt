Abstract    :
              The scientific component of this project focuses on the development and
              utilization of advanced single-molecule techniques to study the fundamentals of
              DNA-protein interactions.  Methods such as x-ray crystallography and nuclear
              magnetic resonance have provided a vast array of structural detail for
              biological molecules, yet are largely limited to a static view that is based on
              ensemble measurements.  In this work single molecule fluorescence detection and
              spectroscopy will be combined with nano-mechanical manipulations, bio-friendly
              surface engineering, and site-directed mutagenesis to construct suitable DNA
              structures and engineered proteins and to study their dynamic interactions at
              the single molecule level.  The educational component of the project focuses on
              the expansion of the physics undergraduate program at the university through a
              course that will introduce students in physics, chemistry, bioengineering, and
              biology to both traditional and modern techniques in biophysics.  The course
              will have a strong laboratory component that will be integrated with the
              university's REU program and a new departmental senior thesis program.  
              Students will be introduced to some of the latest biophysical techniques,
              including patch clap, atomic force microscopy, optical tweezers, magnetic
              tweezers, and single molecule fluorescence detection and spectroscopy.  This
              project is jointly funded by the Division of Physics and the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical
              Sciences and by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the
              Directorate for Biological Sciences.
