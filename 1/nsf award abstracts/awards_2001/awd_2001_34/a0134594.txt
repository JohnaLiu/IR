The PI's research proposes to study the effect of flow on the
              molecular organization of lipid and lipid/protein membranes by employing
              experiments and computational methods. He will make model lipid membranes and
              use fluorescent microscopy to investigate the effect of flow on protein and
              lipid mobility. Many cell types such as erythrocytes and neutrophils are
              regularly exposed to stress and deformation in a flow field that affect the
              behavior of proteins in membrane. This kind of stress stimulus has profound
              biochemical effects on endothelial cells grown under flow conditions. Other
              evidence, such as the alteration of membrane fluidity in disease states,
              suggests that membrane/external flow interactions are important. The PI
              hypothesized that the molecular organization of the membrane can be altered by
              flow-induced stress, and that this alteration can have physiological
              consequences. 

To understand molecular interactions, they will develop a
              multi-scale continuum / molecular dynamic model of the membrane. This
              multi-scale approach will allow us to model fluid flow as a continuum, but
              impose its effect on the discrete atoms of the membrane lipids and proteins. As
              a result, the length of the simulation will be extended to allow investigation
              of long-range motion and order. It is expect this research to make a
              significant contribution in molecular dynamics modeling and membrane biology.
              The computational portion of this project contains several problems that are
              well suited to the abilities of undergraduates. The educational component of
              this proposal will be to involve undergraduates in long-term multidisciplinary
              research. Undergraduate research and extracurricular work have both been shown
              to have a positive impact on undergraduate development.
