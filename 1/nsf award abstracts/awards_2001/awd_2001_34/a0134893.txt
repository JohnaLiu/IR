Abstract    :
              The CAREER award will address the key scientific uncertainties in assessment and
              modeling of climate variability by focusing on moist convective processes and
              their linkage to the larger scale circulation. The award will enable Dr.
              Sherwood to strengthen undergraduate and graduate education and research
              training in climate sciences at Yale. A teaching program aimed at providing a
              physically based understanding of global-scale atmospheric behavior and climate
              will be developed as part of this project. The research and educational goals
              of the project will advance understanding and modeling of moist convective
              processes, particularly their role in regulating interannual climate
              variability through impacts on atmospheric lapse rate, moisture distribution
              and transport, and the hydrological cycle.
