Abstract    :
              Dr. Linda H. Doerrer, Department of Chemistry, Barnard College, is supported by
              the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of the
              Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for her work under a CAREER
              Award to investigate transition metal fluoraryloxide anions, which are relevant
              to industrial polymerization processes requiring weakly coordinating anions and
              the general field of fluorous chemistry.  A second area of study involves bulky
              phosphine ligands that faciliate electron deficient coordination environments
              and the binding of small molecules.  

Integration of Professor Doerrer's
              research and education endeavors benefits from the predominantly female
              environment at Barnard College and an ongoing international collaboration at
              Oxford University that gives undergraduates at both institutions an opportunity
              to engage in research in an international setting.  Professor Doerrer will
              organize and administer an outreach program for students in grades 9-12 and
              their teachers to learn about the emerging area of nanoscience at the Columbia
              University National Science and Engineering Center.  The PI will also revise
              advanced undergraduate laboratory courses at Barnard to incorporate inorganic
              synthesis, and develop a new general chemistry course designed for students
              with generally strong high school backgrounds, but relatively weak chemistry
              preparation.
