Abstract    :
              This project focuses on finding more suitable catalysts for fuel-cell
              electrodes.  The theoretical portion of the work will be aimed at both oxygen
              reduction at the cathode and methanol oxidation at the anode.  Both electric
              field effects and solvent effects will be taken into account.  The theory can
              offer insights into the competition between C-H and O-H bond breaking in the
              methanol molecule on clean platinum single-crystal surfaces.  The CO poisoning
              of the anode will also be addressed.  Studies of CO adsorption on various
              alloys will be studies to determine which alloys give the lowest binding
              energy, and thus have the greatest potential for CO tolerance.  At the cathode
              catalytic bond breaking of the O=O bond will be studies; subsequently, the
              total cathode reaction, which typically involves water formation will be
              investigated.  A complementary combinatorial approach will be undertaken in
              conjunction with guidance from other faculty.  The educational component
              involves the development of a course in computational chemistry.  A program in
              cooperative learning will also be included through the introduction of
              ConceptTests developed elsewhere.  This work has the potential to guide
              research that may result in an improved methanol fuel cell.
