Title: CAREER: Development and Applications of
              Weak Turbulence Theory

Weak turbulence theory provides a broad framework for
              the study of
steady-state statistical properties exibited by large classes
              of
weakly nonlinear or weakly coupled physical systems.  Within
              this
framework, the research component of this work will focus on
              three
fundamental problems in physics: the Garrett-Munk spetrum of
              internal
waves in the ocean, finite-flux spectra in semiconductors
              with
applications to semiconductor lasers, and Bose Einstein condensates.
In
              each case, novel weak-turbulence-inspired techniques will be
developed to
              compute the stationary energy spectra of the phenomena
under investigation,
              which will provide an analytic statistical
description of their long-term
              dynamics.  Applications of this work
include environmental aspects of ocean
              dynamics, semiconductor
manufacturing and increases in laser efficiency, and
              condensed-matter
physics and materials science at low temperatures.  The
              educational
component includes course development on undergraduate and
              graduate
level that will incorporate an experimental component in
              an
undergraduate mathematical modelling course, and a graduate course
              on
waves and weak turbulence theory.

What do internal waves deep below the
              ocean surface, semiconductor
lasers, and extremely cold metallic vapors have
              in common?  They are
all very complicated physical systems composed of simple
              components
that interact weakly.  Weak turbulence theory addresses these type
              of
systems, and precdicts how the energy they contain will behave on
average
              over long times.  The question of how the energy of an
internal ocean wave
              depends on this wave's length has an elegant
experimental answer pointing to a
              universal law, but has eluded
theoretical explanation for more than thirty
              years.  This work aims to
provide such an explanation, which will furnish new
              insights into the
oceanic environment.  Semiconductors and semiconductor
              lasers
manufacturing and operation requires ever increasing efficiency. 
              This
work will explore an improvement that is based on a more efficient
              way
of delivering energy to the working semiconductors and
              semiconductor
lasers.  Three quarters of a century ago Bose and Einstein
              predicted a
new phase of materials, the Bose-Einstein condensate, that can
              only
occur at extremely low temperatures.  Finally, six years ago, this
phase
              was realized experimentally, and the the creators of the
experiment received
              this year's Nobel Prize.  This work will provide a
theoretical explanation of
              how extremely cold metal vapors settle into
the Bose-Einstein condensate
              phase.
