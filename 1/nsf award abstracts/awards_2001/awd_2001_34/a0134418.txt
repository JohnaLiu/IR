Proposal Title: CAREER:
              Systematic Multiscale Modeling of Directed Assembly in Semiconductor Materials
              Processing

The PI proposes to develop a synergistic modeling framework, from
              continuum level through atomistic simulation, to improve the understanding of
              diffusion reaction, and species aggregation during electronic materials
              processing.  The creation of novel structures at length scales smaller than
              those available from traditional top-down fabrication methods requires a
              detailed atomistic understanding of the physics and chemistry governing
              multicomponent processes.  This understanding must be linked also to
              macroscopic scale process operating conditions.  Potential application areas
              that can benefit from such a paradigm include atomistic scale control of bulk
              dopant and defect distribution in silicon microelectronics, defect control in
              other electronic materials such as SiC, SiGe, and GaAs, and controlled
              deposition of multilayered structures for advanced optoelectronic materials.  A
              close coupling of the analytical framework against available experimental
              results will be included in the research program.  A primary goal of the
              educational component of the project will be to introduce electronic materials
              processing into the curriculum choices for chemical engineering majors,
              particularly at the University of Pennsylvania, to increase the number of those
              graduates who move into this important industry.
