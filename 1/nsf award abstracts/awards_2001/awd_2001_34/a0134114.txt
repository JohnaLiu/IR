There are hundreds of Superfund sites in the US contaminated
              with PCBs and 38 states with fish consumption advisories due to PCB
              bioaccumulation.  Several biogeochemical processes, acting individually or in
              combination, attenuate pollutants in soils.  However processes are dependent on
              environmental factors that regulate the growth and activities of specific
              microbial groups or assemblages, as well as bioavailability of chemicals to
              degradation.  This study investigates the roles of these factors in regulating
              microbial community composition and detoxification processes in
              PCB-contaminated wetland soils collected from different parts of the country.
              Detoxification mechanisms, including a variety of technologies will be
              investigated in order to ameliorate a highly chlorinated PCB using indigenous
              soil organisms.  This research is unique in that it links changes in
              environmental conditions with changes in microbial community structure and
              critical microbial detoxification activities in soils. 

The overall
              objective of the proposed research seeks to evaluate whether environmental
              selection pressures are significantly and reproducibly manifested as changes in
              microbial populations and PCB transforming activities in different soil
              environments.  For the educational component of the plan - a new Environmental
              Biogeochemistry Laboratory Methods Manual will be published and used as text
              materials for a new Environmental Biogeochemistry Summer Field Camp to be held
              at UK's research forest.

The teaching objective is aimed at integrating
              research, teaching and mentoring through the publication of a Biogeochemistry
              Laboratory Methods Manual and development of a Biogeochemistry Camp that will
              be open to graduate and undergraduate students, post docs, and teachers
              interested in environmental chemistry and microbial ecology.  The manual will
              be a user-friendly guide of step-by-step instructions on some of the latest
              techniques in environmental research.
