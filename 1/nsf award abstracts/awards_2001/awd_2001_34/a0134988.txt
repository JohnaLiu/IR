Abstract    :
              This CAREER proposal requests support for an expansion of the Education/Outreach
              pilot program based on QuarkNet with three-week summer workshops for high
              school science teachers. In addition, there is a request for funds to build and
              test a prototype high-level trigger and data acquisition system to upgrade the
              CDF Run IIb data collection capability.

A workshop for fourteen
              Rochester-area high school teachers used funding from the QuarkNet initiative
              in Summer 2000. Based on this pilot program, this proposal seeks to expand the
              project by providing three-week workshops for local middle and high school
              physics and physical science teachers with the goal of educating both teachers
              as well as their students about modern particle physics research. There would
              be lectures on particle physics as well as a plan to build cosmic-ray muon
              telescopes. These telescopes would then be used in the high school classrooms
              with student involvement. 

The PI has been heavily involved in the
              high-level trigger and data acquisition system and the offline data
              reconstruction effort for the CDF experiment at Fermilab. With the expectation
              of Run IIb to increase the instantaneous luminosity by a factor of 2.5 and the
              total data collected by a factor of 10, major upgrades in the data acquisition
              and reconstruction systems are needed. This proposal requests funds to purchase
              equipment to prototype and test a low-cost PC-based central analysis farm for
              CDF.
