Abstract    :
              Recent advances such as automotive steer-by-wire systems, radar ranging sensors
              and differential corrections that increase the accuracy of the Global
              Positioning System to 20 centimeters, pave the way for active collision
              avoidance systems.  Unlike passive restraints that seek to minimize the
              severity of an accident, active systems seek to move the vehicle out of harm's
              way, preventing an accident from occurring in the first place.  Yet while the
              necessary components for active collision avoidance will be available in a few
              years, it is not clear how to integrate these into a system that smoothly
              assists the driver while offering guaranteed performance.  
	This project
              develops a framework for collision avoidance systems that assist the driver
              with lanekeeping and evading obstacles in two dimensions.  The approach assigns
              a level of hazard to objects in the environment and applies a virtual force on
              the vehicle proportional to the gradient of this hazard through coordinated
              braking and steering.  Using an energy analogy and Lagrangian dynamics, the
              assisted vehicle can be guaranteed to move away from obstacles while leaving
              the driver in control.  Development of these theoretical guarantees is coupled
              with experimental validation of the concept on a full-scale test vehicle.  The
              experimental equipment is also integrated into a laboratory experience in
              vehicle dynamics and control so that undergraduate and graduate students can
              literally feel the theoretical concepts of dynamics in practice.  
The
              ultimate objective of the project is to demonstrate a theoretically rigorous,
              yet commercially viable, system that can help reduce the approximately 37,000
              traffic fatalities that occur each year, particularly the 40% due to collisions
              with fixed obstacles.
