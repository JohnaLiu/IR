Abstract    :
              This career development project focuses on an experimental study of a novel type
              of "designer solid" consisting of a sample of ultracold Rydberg atoms that are
              strongly coupled by long range dipole-dipole interactions.  The experiments
              investigate a new form of this designer solid -a Rydberg atom crystal.  The
              research works toward developing the ability to control interactions between
              individual atoms in this strongly coupled spin system at the level required to
              produce the entanglement necessary for quantum computations.  The table top
              scale of the proposed research provides excellent opportunities for student
              involvement at a variety of levels.  In addition, the work seeks to broaden the
              exposure of a group of successful women scientists to the larger community. 
              Undergraduate students are involved in the development of a conceptual physics
              course as student teachers whose duties go well beyond those of a typical
              teaching assistant.  They explore teaching pedagogies, help implement
              innovative teaching methods, and help build lecture demonstration resources. 
              Student outreach is being extended beyond the confines of the college through a
              physics demonstration show, which travels to local K-12 schools.
