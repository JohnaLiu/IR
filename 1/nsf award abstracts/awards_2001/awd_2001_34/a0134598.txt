Abstract    :
              The proposed plan will rebuild the electric power and energy systems program at
              the North Dakota Slate University through closely linked research and education
              efforts. The research and educational plans will integrate contemporary issues
              with traditional power systems concepts to prepare both undergraduate and
              graduate students for the new requirements of the industry.  The research plan
              will advance the state of the art in reliability and cost assessment techniques
              with particular focus on distributed energy resources and microgrid
              architectures.  The education plan consists of modernizing some existing
              courses and developing new courses to build a power and energy systems
              curriculum that is both comprehensive and contemporary.

Undergraduate
              students will also be involved in research projects; graduate students will be
              involved with contemporary original research.  The proposed research and
              education activities will significantly strengthen the power program at NDSU,
              and provide it with the momentum it needs to grow into a larger and stronger
              program.

The unique and significant contribution of the proposed research is
              that it will develop reliability and cost assessment techniques that are suited
              to the evolving structure of the electric industry, anticipate the future
              course of the industry and provide effective, cutting edge tools for planning
              and designing future systems.
