Abstract    :
              The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this Career
              award to University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to study light-gated synthetic
              ion channels to control transmembrane currents.  With this award, Professor
              Mary Gin will synthesize cyclodextrin-based channel scaffolds after
              regiospecific modifications.  Modified cyclodextrins with a trapped pH
              sensitive dye will be embedded in homogenous lipid vesicles of approximately
              25nm diameter.  Ion transport activities of these lipid vesicles will be
              determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity changes in the dye.  The
              planned studies are expected to result in the development of sensors; time
              released drugs and improved water purification systems.  The educational
              component of the award is to assist students in Elementary Organic Chemistry
              courses, and to provide graduate and undergraduate students with hand-on
              experience in organic synthesis and modification of bioderived materials. 
              

Light-activated synthetic ion channels will be prepared from
              regiospecific-modified cyclodextrins and embedded in homogenous lipid vesicles
              with uniform diameter.  Changes in fluorescence intensity of a pH sensitive dye
              trapped in these modified cyclodextrins will be utilized to measure ion
              transport activities of these synthetic ion channels.  Sensors, time released
              drugs and improved water purification systems would be some of the potential
              applications coming out of these studies.  In addition, this Career award will
              increase assistance to students in Elementary Organic Chemistry courses, and
              will provide them with research opportunities in organic synthesis and chemical
              modifications of bioderived materials.
