Abstract    :
              Dr. William B. Connick, Department of Chemistry, University of Cincinnat, is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              of the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work under a
              CAREER Award to elucidate the factors governing multielectron transfer
              reactions.  Metal complexes will be prepared that undergo two-electron transfer
              reactions.  Using time-resolved methods, kinetic data will be obtained to
              provide firm mechanistic information for verification of existing models of
              multielectron transfer.

The educational component of this endeavor involves
              the development of a chemistry course for grade 7-12 high school teachers and
              an undergraduate laboratory experiment using a research laser facility;
              thereby, exposing a large number of senior undergraduates to a research
              setting.
