Abstract    :
              TNumerous civilian and military ventures are showing keen interest in the thermo
              photovoltaic (TPV) generation of electricity as an attractive, clean,
              efficient, and inexpensive alternative energy. 

The low power (about 1400 C)
              of TPV heat sources makes gallium antimonide (GaSb), rather than silicon, the
              most common material for TPV cells.  Research on GaSb TPV cells is currently
              focused on: (1) increasing the TPV efficiency, and (2) reducing the cost of
              production.  This document proposes the first study of gallium arsenide (GaAs)
              as a viable material for TPV cells.  There are two compelling reasons.  First,
              the manufacture of TPV cells on a GaAs substrate could take advantage of
              existing GaAs facilities for low-cost, high-yield, large-volume production
              compatible with GaAs integrated circuits (ICs) on large six-inch substrates. 
              Second, our innovative TPV cells can be designed for exceptionally high
              efficiency because of their
simultaneous response, on the same GaAs substrate,
              to both the near infrared (less than 1.5micron) and the mid-infrared
              (2-5micron).

This proposal develops three enabling technologies for making
              high efficiency TPV cells on GaAs: (1) innovative design of intersubband TPV
              devices  for high power conversion efficiency of broadband heat sources; (2)
              novel Low-Temperature Grown (LTG) GaAs designed for strong absorption at the
              1.5micron wavelength (an important TPV wavelength); (3) growth and annealing of
              very highly doped (10^{20}cm^{-3}) contacts, and highly doped tunnel junctions
              connecting series-TPV cells.  

This proposed work is ideally suited for an
              academic environment because of its interdisciplinary nature, emphasizing: both
              theory and experiment; fundamental studies of absorption, transport, and
              materials; and  innovative TPV cells.  One innovation is the proposed design of
              Intersubband Tandem TPV (ITTPV) cells, which have projected conversion
              efficiencies (35%) much higher than those (6%) of existing devices.  The
              proposed study of LTG-GaAs goes beyond previous work in that it emphasizes the
              physics and engineering of a much stronger absorption at 1.5micron.  The
              proposed work on very highly doped TPV tunnel junctions and contacts
              emphasizes: developing physical models of doping limitations; and a novel
              thermal anneal much more rapid (milliseconds instead of seconds) than the
              state-of-the-art capability.  

PI's educational program has three
              components: (1) new curriculum development, (2) mentoring activities, and (3)
              participation in research seminars.
