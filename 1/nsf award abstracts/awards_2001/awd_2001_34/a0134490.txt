Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigators (PIs)' overall objective is to develop plant cell
              and tissue culture technology, which will permit rapid evaluation of
              heterologous gene expression in plants. This work includes the development of
              rigorous principles for the monitoring, control and operation of bioreactors
              for plant cell and tissue culture. These bioreactor operational principles will
              be utilized to correlate performance of transient expression systems using
              Agrobacterium co-cultivation for DNA transformation and the TMV vector or a
              single-stranded DNA geminivirus vector capable of DNA amplification for protein
              production (based on tobacco and corn seed endosperm) while testing expression
              and accumulation of three therapeutic proteins: a monoclonal antibody (NR-LU-10
              MAb), a cytokine (human growth hormone, hGH), and a blood transport protein
              (human transferrin, hTR). The specific objectives are to: (1) Develop
              operational and control strategies for bioreactor growth of plant cell and root
              culture, (2) Develop and optimize techniques / conditions for DNA delivery for
              transient expression, and (3) Utilize bioreactor control strategies and
              optimized transient therapeutic protein expression systems to evaluate
              heterologous transgene expression in plant cell and tissue culture, followed by
              correlation with performance in transgenic plants with the same proteins. 
              

This is a collaborative GOALI project involving three PIs with different
              complementary scientific and technological expertise. Wayne Curtis the primary
              PI at the Pennsylvania State University is an expert in the area of bioreactor
              technology, Hugh Mason the second PI at the Boyce Thompson Institute and
              Cornell University in the area of transgenic plants, and Doug Russell at the
              Integrated Protein Technologies of Monsanto in the area of production of
              proteins from transgenic plants.
