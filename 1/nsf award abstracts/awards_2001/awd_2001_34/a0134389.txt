It is proposed to study
              experimentally and by simulation the behavior of polymers in complex flow.  The
              experiment consists of fluorescently labeled DNA molecules flowing in a 4 to 1
              contraction with its motion observed by video-microscopy.  Simulations of the
              flow will be carried out using both Brownian dynamics model and by the
              course-grained continuum model.  The latter method will lend itself to for
              design studies of processing equipment.  The education plan involves
              introducing new courses in rheology and advanced computational methods and to
              include undergraduate students in the research.  In terms of outreach, The PI
              plans to work with one high school teacher per year to help transfer the
              research experience to the high school students.
