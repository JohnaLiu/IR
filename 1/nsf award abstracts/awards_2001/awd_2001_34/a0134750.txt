Rita Sambruna

Dr. Sambruna, of George Mason University in
              Fairfax, Virginia, is awarded a grant to continue her observational,
              multi-wavelength studies of relativistic jets.  These jets somehow form near
              the centers of active galaxies, and are thought to originate from black holes. 
              These enormous jets extend to many times the size of the galaxy itself. Dr.
              Sambruna's research will take advantage of new and upcoming instrumentation in
              order to probe the underlying physics of these poorly understood phenomena. The
              proposed observations include facilities such as the Hubble Space Telescope and
              the Chandra X-ray telescope in space, the ground-based radio Very Large Array
              and Very Long Baseline Array, and the upcoming VERITAS (Very Energetic
              Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System) ground-based gamma-ray observatory.
              She will address questions such as the origin of the multi-wavelength emission,
              the mechanism for particle acceleration, and the calculation of kinetic energy
              in the jets. 

Dr. Sambruna will also use her grant to enhance her
              educational activities.  She will implement peer instruction techniques into
              her introductory astronomy courses,  establish an astronomy club for the
              departmental majors, and organize a series of workshops for local science
              teachers.
