J. Oberhauser, University of Virginia

The objective
              the proposed research is to study the rheology and microstructure of
              polymer-clay nanocomposites, a novel class of material whose properties combine
              elements of suspension rheology and non-Newtonian fluid mechanics.  The
              research plan has three parts:  (1) to understand the basic rheology of a
              well-characterized nanocomposite fluid as a function of a number of material
              properties, (2) to assess the ability of the clay platelets to function as
              nucleating sites for oriented crystal growth by using a mini-extrusion device,
              and  (3) to develop constitutive theory based on the experimental results.  The
              education plan consists of improving existing courses by including various
              media and implementing some newer pedagogical techniques, to introduce new
              courses, and to include undergraduates in research.
