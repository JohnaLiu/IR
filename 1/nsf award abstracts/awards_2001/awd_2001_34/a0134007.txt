Abstract    :
              This CAREER proposal requests support for research and education in
              astroparticle physics, combining a program to develop low-power electronics for
              cosmic ray and neutrino detectors with an educational activity for high school
              teachers and students as well as university graduate and undergraduate
              students.

The proposal outlines a program designed to develop portable,
              low-power consuming electronics for air fluorescence detectors which could
              function in self-contained units in environments such as the Utah desert or in
              space-based detectors. An intelligent trigger would be used to select potential
              ultra-high energy cosmic ray events using a low-power air fluorescence camera
              and only then would power-consuming electronics be activated. Plans include
              tests using the HiRes 2 detector in a remote part of the Utah desert.

In the
              outreach effort of the proposal, the plan would involve high school teachers
              and university undergraduates building scintillation counters to detect high
              energy cosmic rays. These counters would then be moved to high schools in Utah
              and New Mexico to introduce high school students to the concepts and detector
              techniques of astroparticle physics. The high school program would focus on
              schools in Native American reservations in these states.
