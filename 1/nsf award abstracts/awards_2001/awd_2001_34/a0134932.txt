Abstract    :
              With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program (OMC) in
              the Chemistry Division and the Molecular Biochemistry Program in the Molecular
              and Cellular Biosciences Division (MCB), Professor Dev Arya, of the Department
              of Chemistry at Clemson University, will pursue an interdisciplinary approach
              to the discovery of new ligands for nucleic acid stabilization and will perform
              natural product based synthesis of novel ligands.  He will also pursue studies
              on a variety of natural product-nucleic acid interactions and their subsequent
              development as useful tools in stabilizing higher order nucleic acid
              structures. A major portion of the research builds on the recent discovery in
              his laboratory of the stabilization of DNA and RNA triple helices by
              aminoglycoside antibiotics. Professor Arya proposes to develop an integrated
              research and education plan in nucleic acid chemistry with the long term goal
              of creating a recognized nucleic acid chemistry research and education
              curriculum in the Department of Chemistry, and to establish Clemson University
              as a globally competitive center of excellence in biopolymer education and
              research.

Professor Dev Arya, of the Department of Chemistry at Clemson
              University, with the support of the Organic Dynamics Program and the Molecular
              Biochemistry Program, will develop an interdisciplinary approach to research
              and education. He will develop a new course in biopolymers as well as transfer
              modeling and experimentation to the classroom to show students the synergism
              between education and research and its applicability to real life problems.
              Outreach activities planned by Professor Arya include working with K-12
              students, inviting underrepresented and under-privileged students to spend a
              summer in his laboratory, and working with high school teachers in 23 high
              schools in 9 counties in western South Carolina.
