Abstract    :
              This proposal outlines a comprehensive career plan for advancement of research
              and education in the field of wireless mobile ad hoc networks. The research
              plan consists of two complementary pails. The first is to design and develop a
              novel architecture for scalable multicast routing in wide-area ad hoc networks,
              while the second part proposes new methodologies for evaluation of wireless ad
              hoc routing protocols. The educational plan includes developing wireless
              networking courses coupled with a laboratory, in addition to proposing novel
              methods to improve student participation in the learning process.  Also,
              proposed to design a new scalable architecture for multicast services support
              in large-scale ad hoc networks, the first of its kind.

The proposed research
              program intends to fully utilize high/v adaptive mechanisms in the various
              components of the architecture. Specifically, to design an adaptive zone-based
              hierarchy augmented by the notion of contact nodes to increase network
              coverage. In addition, to provide novel schemes for multicast service support,
              based on adaptive anycast for resource discovery. Also, introduce geographic
              multicast address allocation to map groups into rendezvous regions. All the
              proposed mechanisms are self-configurable, and promise desirable scaling and
              robustness properties.
