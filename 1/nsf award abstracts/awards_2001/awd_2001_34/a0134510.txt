Abstract    :
              The PI proposes study, using a number of state-of-the-art experimental
              techniques, a long-standing-but still inadequately understood-problem of fluid
              mechanics and heat transfer. Annular flow, in which vapor flows through the
              center of a tube surrounded by a thin film of liquid on the wall, is the
              dominant flow condition in many heat exchanger applications involving
              evaporation or condensation.  The results could lead to improved models for
              flows in power, refrigeration and air-conditioning systems, with less reliance
              on empirical data gathered over a narrow range of operating conditions.  An
              educational development plan includes non-traditional approaches to the
              therm-fluids cycle of the undergraduate curriculum, as well as incorporation of
              research results into upper level courses in multiphase flow and convective
              heat transfer.
