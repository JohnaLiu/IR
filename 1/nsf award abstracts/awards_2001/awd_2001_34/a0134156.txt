Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the synthesis of new perovskite related oxides by solid
              state reactions for powder synthesis and the use of high temperature solution
              reactions for crystal growth to yield new classes of oxide materials with
              important chemical and physical properties. These chemical compounds can be
              selectively modified to exhibit desirable physical and chemical properties.
              Improved methods for designing and synthesizing these materials in desired
              physical forms such as powders or as single crystals allow one to investigate
              their electronic and magnetic properties, and to explore their utilization in a
              variety of applications. To accomplish these tasks, undergraduates, graduate
              students and postdoctoral researchers are being trained in cutting edge
              techniques for synthesizing and characterizing these materials using state of
              the art instrumentation such as high-temperature and high-pressure reaction
              vessels, magnetometers and charge coupled device based single crystal
              diffractometers. The strong educational aspect of this research assures that
              highly trained men, women and underrepresented minorities can enter the
              workforce to meet industrial needs for scientists.

Perovskite oxides are
              known for important and interesting magnetic and electronic properties that
              include superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and ionic conductivity, and also
              for compositional flexibility enabling  the development of new electronic
              devices, data storage materials, battery components and superconductors. 
              Undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers trained in these
              cutting edge synthetic and characterization techniques will be very competitive
              for industrial and academic jobs.
