Abstract    :
              The proposed project aims at establishing power quality as catalyst for the
              development and renovation of power engineering research and education at the
              University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez (UPRM). The proposed power quality research
              and education activities will prepare a new kind of power engineer, able to
              meet the energy challenges of the 21st century. Power quality at UPRM will link
              power systems, power electronics and contemporary energy issues in order to
              create an integrated perspective of today's electric energy systems. The
              multidisciplinary nature of power quality problems presents a unique
              opportunity to renovate power-engineering curriculum and inspire students to
              engage in energy systems research. 

Research tasks are centered on the power
              quality impact of power electronics in the electric system, with application to
              alternate energy sources. Photovoltaic (PV) systems will be chosen as a
              representative alternate source. Research activities include nonlinear device
              modeling for power quality studies; improvement and development of tools to
              quantify power quality events; implementation and testing of scaled PV systems
              including various grid-interface options; validation of models/indices using
              the scaled systems; consideration of interconnection issues such as the power
              quality impact of different grid-interface options and the interaction with
              other loads in the system. The establishment of a PV testing facility will
              support research in distributed generation and policy issues such as
              deregulation.
