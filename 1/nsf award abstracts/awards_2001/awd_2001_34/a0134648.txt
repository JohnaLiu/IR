Abstract    :
              

Organisms evolve by changing their genomes, including small changes (point
              mutations) and gross changes (genomic rearrangements). Genomic rearrangements
              are more likely than point mutations to quickly produce novel traits by
              rearranging functional domains and expression control sequences.  Although
              genomic rearrangements have profoundly impacted genome evolution, they have yet
              to be shown to be directly advantageous in an experimentally evolving
              population of a eukaryotic organism.  The investigators have recently shown
              that the exposure of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to suboptimal
              conditions such as starvation or heavy water induces recombination genes in a
              small subset of cells.  It is important to understand whether this induction of
              recombination genes plays a role in adaptation by producing adaptive genomic
              rearrangements and, if so, what are the mechanisms that control such processes.
               Three ideas will be tested in this work: 1) The rate of recombination is
              increased in populations adapting to adverse environments,  2) Cells recombine
              at different rates in adapting populations and 3) Adaptation-associated genomic
              rearrangements are under genetic control.  The investigators will analyze
              genomic rearrangements arising in populations during adaptation to growth in
              heavy water, a mild and broad selective agent that models previously
              unencountered habitats, and compare it to starvation, a common selective
              condition that parallels selection in nature. The rates of genomic
              rearrangements in adapting yeast populations will be assayed using novel
              chromosome recombination reporter constructs, genomic arrays and genomic
              polymorphism analysis.  Distributions of recombinants in adapting populations
              will be assayed by fluorescent protein reporters coupled with flow cytometry. 
              Finally, the investigators will analyze genetic pathways that control the
              adaptation-associated rearrangements, using available expression array data to
              find candidate genes, and analyze the candidate pool using recombination
              reporter assays.  

Learning about molecular mechanisms that control genomic
              rearrangements in suboptimal conditions will help us understand the process and
              control of adaptive evolution in eukaryotes.  With the aid of genomic
              information available, we will better understand how genomes are shaped by
              evolutionary forces.  Finally, the project may help to predict the evolutionary
              response of organisms exposed to novel environments.
