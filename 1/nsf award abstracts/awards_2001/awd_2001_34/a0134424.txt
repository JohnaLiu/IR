Abstract    :
              0134424  Montas  The overall objective of the proposed project is to develop an
              excellent, unified and integrated program of research and teaching in
              engineering computation applied to biological resources systems. The proposed
              study consists of two educational components and three research components
              aimed at achieving this goal. The educational objectives are to: 1) Develop an
              undergraduate electronic textbook on engineering computation in biological
              resources, and; 2) Integrate stochastic theory, wavelet analysis and decision
              support into graduate level course contents and electronic documents.
              
Research objectives are to: 1) Develop the stochastic-continuum theory of
              biotransport processes and validate it across biological resources systems; 2)
              Assess the ability of wavelet-stochastic techniques to classify biological
              resource image data; 3) Develop and evaluate decision support applications in
              biological resources areas. Successful completion of this project is expected
              to contribute significantly to engineering knowledge and to excellent teaching
              of engineering computation applied to biological resources at undergraduate and
              graduate levels.***
