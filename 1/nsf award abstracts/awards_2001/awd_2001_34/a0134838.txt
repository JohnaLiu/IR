Abstract    :
              Support is requested for a CAREER development plan at Penn State University
              which synergistically integrates research and education activities in the area
              of atmospheric aeronomy and electrodynamics, and space plasma physics.  The PI
              and his undergraduate and graduate students will develop a dynamic research
              program at Penn State directed on understanding of the recently discovered
              large scale luminous phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere above active
              thunderstorm systems.  The proposed research project will provide answers to
              critical questions concerning large scale energetic effects of lighting
              discharges on the upper regions of the Earth's atmosphere and implications of
              the associated energy depositions for the thermal and chemical balance of these
              regions.  Specific educational activities of the proposed CAREER plan include
              development of a multi-disciplinary computer experiment laboratory for
              undergraduate and graduate students at Penn State majoring in Electrical
              Engineering, Aerospace Engineering and Nuclear Engineering, incorporation of
              the elements of proposed research in undergraduate education, including active
              involvement of undergraduate students in proposed research activities during
              summer time periods, and providing active mentoring and training for
              undergraduate and graduate students.
