NSF
              CISE and EU IST have in place a Memorandum of Understanding to conduct a series
              of joint program planning workshops in order to develop plans for a series of
              joint programs in CISE-related areas between the US and the European Union. 
              The EU IST has designated ERCIM as the coordinator of nine planning workshops
              to be held in Europe over the three year period starting in 2001.  NSF will
              support a travel grant program through DIMACS as requested in this proposal to
              cover costs of the US delegation to these international program planning
              workshops, beginning with the Bionics workshop in Brussels on June 18, 2001.
