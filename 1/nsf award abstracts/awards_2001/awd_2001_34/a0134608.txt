Abstract    :
              The proposers plan to implement the Improved Student Performance model of school
              reform, developed by the Ventures Education System Corporation (VESC), in the
              reservation schools.  This model was chosen by the teachers and administrators
              of the participating districts.  Supporting the Ventures implementation, as
              well as the other objectives, the project leaders plan to conduct professional
              development for in-service teachers, and include pre-service student teachers
              in the activities as well.  The project will also provide modest funding for
              extracurricular content-focused activities for students, and to better involve
              parents, as well as contracting for services to increase the cultural content
              in the curriculum.
