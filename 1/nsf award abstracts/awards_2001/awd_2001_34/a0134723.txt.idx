Abstract    :
              At the heart of the genomics revolution has been the democratization of genome
              projects of all varieties - EST sequencing, large-scale mapping, and both
              limited and complete genome sequencing projects. This has resulted in the
              production of large, associated datasets of diverse types that are often
              scattered in space, time, and format. This has made comparative analyses
              difficult and makes the creation of integrated databases a significant, if not
              often insurmountable challenge. The goal will be to discuss and to attempt to
              define what is meant by accessible, timely, and usable data and how NSF and
              USDA can help to facilitate such data coordination for plant genome data. The
              objective is to define the design elements that will ensure modular,
              extensible, interoperable, machine and human queryable data structures and
              interfaces.
