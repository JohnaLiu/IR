Abstract    :
              Funds are provided for a parallel analog and numerical modeling study to
              understand the structure of turbidity currents and nature of sediment deposits
              as they travel in meandering channels, 3-D seismic data on subsurface meanders
              will be used to link the model data with field observations.  The research will
              be integrated with graduate and undergraduate education at University of South
              Carolina.
