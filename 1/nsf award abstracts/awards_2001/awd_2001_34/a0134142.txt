Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to use the polymerization of ylides by trialkyl
              boranes for the controlled synthesis of linear and cyclic hydrocarbon polymers.
               The attributes of this methodology are the ability to control molecular
              weight, to prepare functionalized polymethylene derivatives and novel
              architectures and polymethylene copolymers.  Because of the importance of the
              closely related polyethylene, these functional materials have potential value
              as compatibilizers, blending agents and surface modifiers.

With this award,
              the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of
              Dr. Kenneth J. Shea of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
              California, Irvine.  Professor Shea will focus his work on the development of
              new polymerization reactions for the preparation of substituted carbon backbone
              polymers.  The development of new catalysts for these reactions will contribute
              to the mechanistic understanding of carbon-carbon forming reactions and can
              benefit both polymer and small molecule synthesis.  The research is also an
              excellent arena for the training of graduate students.
