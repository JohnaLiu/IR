Abstract    :
              Abstract:
The nonlinear vibrations and aeroelastic stability of two-dimensional
              gyroscopic systems such as high-speed rotating disks and translating webs are
              investigated using computational, analytical, and experimental techniques
              together with state-of-the-art models of nonlinear flexible rotating disks and
              thin translating webs interacting with three-dimensional shear flows. 

The
              research aims to identify regions in parameter space where aeroelastic flutter
              occurs, and investigate the complex post-flutter nonlinear modal interactions
              of this category of two-dimensional gyroscopic systems. The results will lead
              directly to a fundamental understanding of the factors (i) limiting rotation or
              transport speeds and (ii) causing flutter instabilities and will be critical
              for the future design of information storage and synthetic material processing
              technologies such as magnetic hard disk drives, optical drives, data storage
              tapes, printing, and paper, textile, plastics, and metal foil processing
              systems. 

The education plan focuses on the PI's current activities in five
              key areas for integrating research, education, and industrial outreach,
              including, amongst others (i) leveraging the PI's research in collaboration
              with Purdue's Minority in Engineering and Women in Engineering Programs for the
              recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups and women in engineering,
              and (ii) enhancing the undergraduate curriculum through the creation of a
              novel, hands-on "Mechanics Laboratory".
