The objective of the proposed research is to develop the
              knowledge and techniques to generate polymeric materials specifically designed
              to deliver genetic material to human cells.  These materials can be termed
              "artificial viruses" and could bring benefits such as: (a) the capacity to
              carry large genes, (b) improved safety, (c) systematic administration, and (d)
              relatively easy production and purification.  This research will focus on
              understanding how DNA/polymer complexes (polyplexes) navigate through the cell.
               To deliver DNA from outside the cell to the nucleus, a vector must be
              endocytosed, escape from endocytic vesicles, undergo transport to and across
              the nuclear envelope, and release the DNA from the complex.  The proposed
              research will focus on escape from the endocyric vesicles and transport to the
              nuclear envelope, since these are often thought to be the limiting steps.  The
              research will also address the role of the cytoplasmic motility of polyplexes
              in moving through the cytosol to the nuclear membrane.  The speck aims of this
              research are to: (1) to quantify the effects of polymer buffering on escape
              from the endocytic vesicles, (2) elucidate the mechanism of polyplex transport
              across the nuclear membrane, and (3) determine the kinetics and mechanisms of
              transport of polyplex vectors through the cytoplasm.
