Abstract    :
              The PI investigate the effects of controlling the surface microstructure on the
              single phase flow and heat transfer in microchannels, using whole field
              temperature measurement techniques.  If successful, the research could lead to
              improved performance of MEMS devices and a variety of small scale, high heat
              flux devices, such as heat sinks for microprocessors, wearable air conditioners
              for harsh environments, and portable cooling units. The work could also clarify
              the sometimes contradictory and inconsistent body of experimental data that
              exist for heat transfer and fluid flow in microchannels.  The educational plan
              includes the development of Cross Educational Research Teams involving graduate
              students, undergraduates and high school studens working with the faculty
              member as a coordinated team.
