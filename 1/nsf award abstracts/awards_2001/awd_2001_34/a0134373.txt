Dr. Gnedin is awarded funds at the University of Colorado at Boulder
              to further develop new methods of modeling the first reionization of the early
              universe.  Current data on the cosmic background radiation indicate that the
              gas content of the universe remained mostly neutral from the time of
              recombination at a redshift of about 1000 to a time corresponding to a redshift
              of about twenty. Observations of quasars at redshifts of about six indicated
              that, at that time, the intergalactic medium was highly ionized.  Thus this
              "reionization", the shift of intergalactic gas from mostly neutral to mostly
              ionized, must have happened sometime between the times corresponding to
              redshifts of six and twenty.  Dr. Gnedin will make significant improvements on
              numerical methods of modeling radiative transfer with the hope of achieving
              numerical convergence. These models will be able to make quantitatively
              accurate predictions for the evolution of the intergalactic medium for the
              first time. Dr. Gnedin will further compare the model results to "Lyman Break
              Galaxies," some of the most primordial observed galaxies, in an attempt to
              understand their formation.

Dr. Gnedin will integrate his teaching and
              research by developing a new undergraduate course in cosmology for non-science
              majors, and developing the cosmology portion of a web-based course in general
              introductory astronomy. The web-based work will include original simulations
              drawn from his research. He will also work with undergraduate majors to develop
              a new planetarium show on cosmology.
