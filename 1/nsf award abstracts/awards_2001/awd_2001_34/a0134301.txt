The ultimate goal of this research is to develop tools to
              predict the removal of pathogenic viruses and precursors to potentially
              carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic disinfection by products by membranes
              as a step towards reducing microbial and chemical risks in drinking water.  The
              proposed work is based on the following hypotheses:

1. Hindered diffusion of
              natural organic matter (NOM) contributes significantly to its transport across
              nanofiltration membranes leading to formation of toxic disinfection by-products
              (DBPs) upon chlorination.

2. Diffusion of pathogenic viruses contributes
              substantially to their transport across microfilters and ultrafilters and its
              dependence on water chemistry, temperature, and pore size can be
              quantified.

3. Direct measurements of membrane pore size distributions and
              transport parameters of NOM and viruses in membranes can be incorporated into
              theoretical models to predict their removal.

Even though early research had
              been conducted on diffusive transport of salts across reverse osmosis, this
              investigation will be the first to perform direct measurements of NOM diffusion
              across nanofiltration membranes.  Transport of NOM, DBP precursors, and viruses
              across membranes will be investigated experimentally and theoretically.  Direct
              measurements of convection and diffusion of these contaminants across membranes
              under varying water chemistry conditions will be interpreted by undertaking
              numerical calculations of hindered transport.  Universally applicable models
              (independent of membrane used and source water location) to predict
              trihalomethane and haloacetic acid speciation in "precursor-limited" waters
              (low NOM content) will also be derived.
