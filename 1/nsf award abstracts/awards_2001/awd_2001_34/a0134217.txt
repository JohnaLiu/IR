Under this CAREER Award, methods in computational mechanics
              will be developed to study the function of healthy and diseased human feet and
              ankles.  Though injuries and musculoskeletal disorders outnumber those seen at
              any other joint, especially among the elderly, the foot and ankle are two of
              the least well-understood areas of the human musculoskeletal system. 
              Mechanical analysis has lagged behind that of other joints due to difficulty in
              defining axes of joint rotation and significant inter-subject variability.  The
              research plan focuses on refining computational tools that will be used to
              locate the two major joint axes of the ankle noninvasively in individual
              subjects through mathematical optimization techniques.  Subject specific
              models, which can be used by orthopaedic surgeons to study the effects of an
              untested variation in a surgical procedure while minimizing the risks to
              patients, will be based on MR scans of the lower legs of fifteen
              subjects.

The educational component of the plan focuses on fostering
              interest in biomechanics in general and the foot and ankle problem in
              particular among undergraduate kinesiology and engineering students, with an
              emphasis on reaching underrepresented groups  Two new laboratories will be
              developed and a seminar series to bring together basic scientists and
              clinicians and to expose students to career possibilities in biomechanics and
              related fields will be introduced.
