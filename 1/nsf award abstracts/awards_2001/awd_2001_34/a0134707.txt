Optical coherence tomography has matured into a successful
              mesoscopic biomedical imaging technique, and is currently under investigation
              for many applications in fundamental biology and clinical medicine.  Real-time
              imaging is particularly pertinent in medical diagnostic situations, where it is
              desirable to screen large tissue regions rapidly.  This submission proposes
              development of a radically new concept for a mass-produced, inherently robust,
              digitally addressed integrated-optic optical delay line for optical coherence
              tomography.  Successful demonstration of the integrated addressable delay will
              lead to development of a fast, arbitrarily addressable delay module which would
              serve as an enabling technology to allow for wider application of this imaging
              technique.
