Under this CAREER Award, macroscale tissue mechanics will be
              bridged to cellular- and molecular-level control elements to examine how cells
              act in concert to manage mechanical stresses in their shared environment.  The
              focus is on issues of tissue fluid balance, in particular on the effects of
              interstitial flow on matrix remodeling in a dynamic living environment.  To
              characterize the system, an in vivo model of lymphangiogenesis into an
              implanted collagen gel (in situ model in the rat tail) will be observed over
              time.  Based on the qualitative data obtained, a 3D in vitro model in which the
              physical environment can be tightly controlled and cell response readily
              ascertained will be developed.  The two models will then be used symbiotically
              to examine the relationship between extracellular matrix architecture and
              interstitial flow, with particular focus on the organization and development of
              interstitial water channels.  The notion of interstitial-flow induced matrix
              remodeling and vessel formation can be used to address a number of related
              research questions.

The educational component focuses on integrating
              traditional biomedical engineering topics with contemporary problems in the
              biological sciences and biotechnology.  Specific areas to be addressed are: 
              reconstructing the biomechanics and biotransport curriculum within the
              department (new courses in Advanced Tissue Mechanics and Transport in Living
              Systems and increased involvement in the NSF Engineering Research Center on
              Engineering Education), enhancing the bioengineering community within the
              engineering school (establish a focus in biomechanics) and introducing
              non-traditional, interdisciplinary components to the engineering curriculum
              (new course in societal implications of technology).
