Abstract    :
              The PI is proposing to develop a new CFD code that will predict the coupled
              ventilation behavior of indoor and outdoor airspaces, including species
              (pollutants, chemical agents) transport.  She will then couple this with large
              scale building energy simulation programs (already in existence) that do not
              contain sophisticated ventilation capabilities except on an energy balance
              basis.  Validation, testing, and optimization of this computation "system" as a
              design tool is a major part of the proposed effort. Potential impacts include
              reliable design tools and guidelines for healthy and energy efficient
              buildings.  In addition, the theory can be used to design mitigation strategies
              for chemical or biological agent attacks, such as determining the best sensing
              positions for quick responses to agent releases, activation of suitable
              ventilation systems to create a safe zone for occupants, and provision of
              suitable means to clean the buildings after an attack.  It will also serve to
              bring architects and engineers more constructively together at the design
              phase.  The education contribution of the research will include two new courses
              directed at architecture and engineering students in the areas of integrated
              building systems design and in the use of computational fluid dynamics in
              building systems design.
