Abstract    :
              
A fundamental component of judgment and decision making is hypothesis
              evaluation, a process that is embedded in many real-world tasks. For example,
              physicians presumably consider the likelihood of various diseases prior to
              issuing a diagnosis, mechanics presumably assess the likelihood of various
              causes of automobile failure before investing time and money in repairs, and
              auditors presumably evaluate the likelihood of various sources of accounting
              errors prior to pursuing the sources of errors. Tied to the process of
              hypothesis evaluation is the process of hypothesis generation. Hypothesis
              generation involves the generation, or recall, of the to-be-evaluated
              hypotheses. Hypothesis generation is an equally important component of
              judgment, as the outcome of the generation process determines which alternative
              hypotheses ultimately are evaluated by the decision maker.

The purpose of
              the present research is to examine both the hypothesis evaluation and
              hypothesis generation aspects of judgment within the context of mainstream
              memory theory. In particular, this research will focus on testing and extending
              a memory model (Minerva-DM) to account for how people make judgments of
              probability and how they generate hypotheses. The overall goal of this research
              is to provide an integrative theory of likelihood judgment and hypothesis
              generation while accounting for most of the likelihood judgment phenomena in
              the judgment-under-uncertainty literature.
