Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to investigate the dynamics of multi-scale thermal convection in
              the mantle. Important surface tectonic features can be attributed to mantle
              convection at two distinct scales: The plate-scale associated with the motion
              of surface plates and the small-scale associated with hot spot volcanism,
              mantle thermal plumes, and lithospheric instabilities. By studying the dynamic
              interaction between convection at different scales, the proposed research will
              improve our understanding of the following fundamental geodynamic questions: 1)
              formation and heat transfer of thermal plumes in the presence of plate-scale
              convection, 2) the cause of relatively small hot spot motion, 3) topographic
              anomalies produced by thermal plumes and their implications for layered mantle
              convection, 4) vertical motion of Hawaiian islands in the last 400 thousand
              years and its relation to plume-plate interaction. Another important component
              of this project is on education, specifically on more efficient integration of
              Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) into geoscience education. The PI proposes to
              develop a set of simulators that use the GFD approaches and computer modeling
              to help students understand a variety of geophysical and geological processes
              ranging from thermal convection, viscoelastic stress relaxation, surface
              loading and crustal compensation, fluid flow in porous media, and convection
              for icy materials. These simulators use simple computer modeling and animations
              to offer students direct experience about how to simplify complex processes
              into physical models and to understand the processes with GFD.
