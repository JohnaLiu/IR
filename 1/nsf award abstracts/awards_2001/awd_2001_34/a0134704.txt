Abstract    :
              The research focus of this work is to develop asymmetric catalytic fragment
              coupling reactions for the synthesis of complex molecules.  The central theme
              of the approach is "triple diastereoselection",  in which a chiral catalyst is
              used to overcome the poor diastereoselectivity obtained in stereochemically
              mismatched coupling reactions.  Nickel-catalyzed intermolecular reductive
              coupling of alkynes and aldehydes (or imines) forms the basis of the coupling
              strategy.  The focus of the educational effort will be the development of
              lecture and laboratory courses in organic chemistry.  Dr. Jamison along with
              graduate and undergraduate collaborators will participate in the project. 
              Further, high school outreach will be carried out by the graduate student
              participants.

With this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr.
              Timothy F. Jamison of the Department of Chemistry at the Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology.  Professor Jamison will focus his research on the
              development of new asymmetric catalytic reactions for the synthesis of diverse
              and complex organic molecules.  Further, the methodology allows the preparation
              of complex molecules from common, simple starting materials.  This approach
              could have important ramifications for the pharmaceutical and agricultural
              industries.  The educational activities of the award will center around the MIT
              Chemistry Outreach Program and course development.
