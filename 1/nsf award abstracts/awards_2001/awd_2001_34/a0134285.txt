Abstract    :
              Dr. Li Jia, Department of Chemistry, Lehigh University, is supported by the
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of the Division of
              Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work under a CAREER Award to
              advance the design and development of a new class of homogeneous catalytic
              reactions as an economically attractive route for the synthesis of
              poly-beta-peptides.  This new chemistry involves the alternating
              copolymerizations of aziridines and carbon monoxide with cobalt complexes as
              catalysts.  

This research is coupled with an educational objective to
              foster creative chemistry problem-solving in students to prepare them to deal
              with arising problems in the chemical industry.  An inquiry-based laboratory
              course will be used to teach students the intellectual process of creative
              problem solving.  Industrial speakers will be invited to give seminars at a
              mini-symposium on "Problem-Solving in the Chemical Industry".  Close industrial
              partnership to enrich students' educational experiences and to facilitate 
              technological innovation is a hallmark of the program.
