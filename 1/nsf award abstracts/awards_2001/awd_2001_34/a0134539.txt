Abstract    :
              The secreted proteins called "neurotrophic factors" exert diverse biological
              effects on neurons in different developmental contexts, such as
              differentiation, target innervation, and synaptic specification.  Recent
              studies by our group and others suggest that glial cell line-derived
              neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NRTN), the two closely related
              neurotrophic factors, are required for the normal development of several
              parasympathetic neuron populations and that these proteins are released from
              target tissues at early embryonic ages.  The goal of this project is to
              elucidate the functional role of GDNF in the generation and differentiation of
              parasympathetic ciliary ganglion neurons that innervate striate muscle and
              smooth muscle in the eye.  The following three questions will be addressed: (1)
              Does GDNF promote neurogenesis or neuronal differentiation in the ciliary
              ganglion?  (2) Does GDNF provide a guidance cue for growing ciliary axons?  (3)
              Does GDNF regulate the expression of a proper number of neurotransmitter
              receptors in ciliary ganglion neurons?  Normal functions of GDNF will be
              manipulated both in vitro and in vivo, and resultant changes in gene
              expression, protein synthesis, axon outgrowth and receptor localization will be
              analyzed.  These experiments would represent the first systematic attempt to
              isolate molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with parasympathetic
              neuron development, and substantially advance our understanding of neuronal
              identity and specification.
