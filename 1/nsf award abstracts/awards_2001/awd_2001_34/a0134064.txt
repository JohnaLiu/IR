Abstract    :
              This CAREER proposal combines a research program on the fundamental
mechanics
              of web handing systems with  two curriculum development projects.
The research
              development plan in web handling is motivated by the needs of
companies in
              many industries, including 3M, Kodak, Procter & Gamble, and SRS
Technologies,
              to better understand and more rapidly process thin, flexible
material.  These
              handling processes produce a wide variety of products such
as carpet, fabric,
              shrink-wrap, diapers, and paper towel.  Universal issues
that prevent more
              efficient operation-such as slip in wound rolls,
wrinkling, creasing, and
              vibration-will be studied.  The fundamental
questions answered by this
              research will allow companies to more rapidly and
efficiently produce their
              products.  The curriculum development plan has two
major thrusts.  The first
              thrust will be the development of two unique
courses concerning the
              mathematical modelling of solids and structures.
These courses will expose
              students to modelling issues that occur in the
study of web handling systems
              and throughout engineering.  The second thrust
will be an extensive overhaul
              of Penn States required undergraduate
vibrations course.  One section will be
              combined with the optional
vibrations laboratory class.  Additionally, the
              studio concept, combining
lecture, laboratory and recitation into one
              educational experience, will be
introduced.  Along with traditional lectures,
              small teams of students will
use classroom computers to complete activities,
              allowing them to more
thoroughly learn the subject.
