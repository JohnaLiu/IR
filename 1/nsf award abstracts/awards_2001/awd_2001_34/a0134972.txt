Abstract    :
              The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this award to
              Tulane University.  With this Career award, Professor Sankaran Thayumanavan
              will study molecular interactions in macromolecules, and will design parameters
              for functional and dynamic dendrimers.  Dendrimers with both hydrophobic and
              hydrophilic groups will be designed, synthesized and functionalized to provide
              hydrophilic outer surfaces in polar solvents and hydrophilic outer surfaces in
              apolar solvents. The studies will provide key concepts for the development of
              designed second order structure in macromolecules with functional utility. 
              With these dendrimers, it would be possible to sequester apolar organic
              substrates into these dendrimeric interiors in polar media for applications in
              catalysis, phase transfer reactions, drug delivery systems and sensors.  The
              proposed educational outreach program 'Tulane Science Scholars Program is a
              strong educational program, and this program will expose local high school
              students to science and engineering programs.  The PI, the Co-director of the
              program with the help of other faculty members, will be provide courses to high
              school juniors and seniors in Chemistry, Physics, Cell Biology, Molecular
              Biology, Environmental Sciences, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering
              and Biomedical Engineering during Fall and Spring semesters. 

New
              dendrimeric polymers with functional groups may be used in polar and apolar
              solvents with applications in catalysis, phase transfer reactions, drug
              delivery systems and sensors.  The proposed Tulane Science Scholars Program
              will expose high school students in different aspects of science and
              engineering subjects, and will prepare them for advanced studies in science and
              engineering programs at college level.
