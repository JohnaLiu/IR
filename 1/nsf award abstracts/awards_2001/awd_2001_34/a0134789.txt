Abstract    :
              This project aims at applying grain-boundary engineering to develop
              high-temperature structural alloys such as Ni-based superalloy and Ti2AlNb
              intermetallics. Major objective of the proposed project is to develop better
              understanding of the inter-relationship of processing steps, grain boundary
              character distribution (GBCD), and creep behavior of high-temperature 
              structural alloys. The main goals of this study are ; (1) to process
              microstructures with a distribution of  random and special grain boundaries;
              (2) to measure grain boundary character distribution (GBCD); (3) to perform
              creep testing of varied microstructures; (4) to model the effects of grain
              size, grain boundary sliding, and grain boundary character on mechanical
              behavior. The project leads to the development of a processing methodology
              useful to enhance the  mechanical behavior of high-temperature structural
              materials. The educational outreach component incorporates the research tools
              used in the research portion of the project and contributes to an increase in
              the number of undergraduate students majoring in materials science and
              engineering (MS&E).
%%%
The research develops new understanding of the
              deformation mechanisms of structural materials beyond the present state of the
              art through grain-boundary engineering. The results are applicable for
              development of better materials for high-temperature applications.
