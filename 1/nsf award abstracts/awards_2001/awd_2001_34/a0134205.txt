Under this CAREER Award, the musculoskeletal system at the
              component level (joint anatomy and tissue dynamics) during functional movements
              will be characterized.  Characterization will be accomplished by developing a
              set of interdisciplinary tools (virtual functional anatomy - VFA) that will
              allow the accurate and precise measurement of 3D static and dynamic
              musculoskeletal anatomy.  Fast-PC MRI (phase contrast magnetic resonance
              imaging) will be be combined with high-resolution 3D musculoskeletal models to
              create subject-specific 3D total joint anatomy models, animated based on actual
              joint movements during volitional movement.  The initial focus will be on the
              musculoskeletal kinematics and kinetics of the knee joint while subjects extend
              and flex their knees.  Stress-strain properties of the patellar and quadriceps
              tendons along with their moment arms, strain within the anterior and posterior
              cruciate ligaments and the contribution of each quadriceps muscle to the
              resultant extensor force will be determined.  Once developed, the modular VFA
              tool can be adapted to other musculoskeletal systems utilizing other sources of
              dynamic and/or imaging data.  

The educational component focuses on
              developing a mechanical engineering Master's level curriculum specializing in
              biomechanics, which would be based on two research-oriented courses-Imaging
              Technologies and Functional Movement Analysis--that would integrate the VFA
              produced through the research and be enhanced with web-based experimental
              programs.  Outreach programs designed to allow young women the opportunity to
              explore potential careers in science or engineering will continue to be
              supported.
