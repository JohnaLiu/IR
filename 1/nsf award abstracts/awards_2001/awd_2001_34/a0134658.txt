Abstract    :
              Dr. Patrick Holland, Department of Chemistry, University of Rochester is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              of the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work under a
              Career Award to utilize coordination chemistry to uncover novel modes of
              reactivity and address issues in enzymatic, surface and solution catalysis. 
              Three-coordinate transition metal complexes will be used to develop knowledge
              applicable to metalloproteins and catalysts.  A particular focus is on
              modelling the reduction of unsaturated organic compounds by the enzyme
              nitrogenase.  Research and education will be integrated by training
              undergraduates to be involved in the research effort and incorporating team
              learning into undergraduate and graduate inorganic chemistry courses at the
              University of Rochester.

This research cuts across such fields as biology
              and chemical catalysis and focuses on metal sites with less than a full
              complement of ligands.  Dr. Holland's research aims at a fundamental
              understanding of the reactivity of such sites that will aid in understanding
              how enzymes function and in developing new types of catalysts.  Team learning
              in undergraduate and graduate courses will involve students in chemistry as a
              social activity to better integrate science  into their lives.
