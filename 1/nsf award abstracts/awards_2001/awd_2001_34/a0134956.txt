Abstract    :
              This project aims to develop new leading-edge instrumentation as tools for
              advancing the understanding of chemical and physical mechanisms of doping and
              charge conduction in organic conductors and semiconductors. The goal is to
              enhance the ability to quantify and image surface charge since the detecting 
              charge with better than single electron sensitivity over a wide range of
              temperatures and pressures will significantly advance the science and
              engineering of organic device fabrication. Another goal is to explore the
              possibilities for measuring sub-femto Newton forces and ultimately
              single-molecule nuclear magnetic resonance imaging by force microscopy. The
              educational goals include exploring the integration of this research with
              chemistry-based materials science directed to training undergraduates,
              particularly engineers, and for outreach to Kindergarten through grade 12
              students.

The development of all silicon technology hinges upon the
              inherently low charge trap density at the silicon / silicon dioxide interface.
              The presence of interface charge traps in organic devices has seriously
              retarded the development of high-efficiency organic transistor type devices.
              Designing and using tools that can be used to characterize and remove these
              charge traps will be crucial to the commercialization of organic based devices.
              Students trained in these areas will compete very effectively for job
              opportunities.
