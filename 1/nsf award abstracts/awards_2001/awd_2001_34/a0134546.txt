The PI is
              proposing to develop a broad range of simulation techniques to address several
              difficult and important problems in the area of modeling nanoscale systems such
              as MEMS devices, including Brownian motion of complex shape microstructures,
              motion of charged particles and motion of flexible molecules.  

The PI is
              also proposing to develop a hybrid continuum/atomistic simulation for systems
              that span a broad range of length scales.  All of the techniques are either
              novel or are building off of state of the art work in the literature.  

In
              the education plan, the PI proposes to develop two undergraduate courses and
              one graduate course in the area of computational methods for MEMS devices.  The
              two undergraduate courses will deal with fluid simulations associated with
              these devices and the graduate course will incorporate the more novel numerical
              techniques described in the research plan.
