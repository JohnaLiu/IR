Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to characterize the chemical and physical
              characteristics of aerosol particles above, in, and below stratocumulus clouds.
               The study will be carried out as part of the DYCOMS-II project (Dynamics and
              Chemistry of Marine Stratocumulus), off the California coast in July 2001.  The
              interaction of aerosol and cloud particles will be evaluated by comparing the
              size distributions and chemical composition of particles measured within cloud
              with those outside the cloud.  Measurements of the cloud droplet size
              distribution will be used to investigate the effects of aerosol particles on
              cloud microphysical properties.  Instrumentation includes particle
              spectrometers for the size range 0.005 to 6400 micrometers.  Electron
              microscopy of aerosol samples will be used to identify chemical functional
              groups, including organic species, and elements.  The residue of cloud droplets
              collected by counterflow virtual impaction will be analyzed the same way.  The
              data will give insight on the following scientific problems: (1) the chemical
              composition of particles incorporated into cloud droplets; (2) the effects of
              different aerosol chemical types and size distributions on cloud microphysics;
              (3) the degree of chemical processing of the aerosols by cloud; (4) the extent
              to which the observations can be approximated by physical and chemical cloud
              models.  The ultimate goal of the research is to improve the ability to
              parameterize the radiative, dynamic, and thermodynamic effects of clouds in
              large-scale models of atmospheric circulation and climate.
