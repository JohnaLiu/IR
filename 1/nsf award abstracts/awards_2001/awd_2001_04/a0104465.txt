Dr. Coble is awarded an NSF
              Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of
              research and education at the University of Chicago.  Her research program
              centers on measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) which will
              test the standard theory of structure formation in the early universe.  Her
              observations will be made with the Degree Angular Scale Interferometer (DASI),
              which is currently operating at the South Pole Station.  DASI will be used to
              measure the as yet undetected polarization of the CMB, and following a planned
              upgrade will be used to observe smaller angular scales as well as the
              Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in galaxy clusters.  Dr. Coble's educational program
              will be carried out at the Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum, where she
              will teach courses on astronomy and cosmology, and establish a communications
              link to the South Pole while she is conducting research.
