Abstract    :
              This project is to support a problem-posing and problem-
solving workshop on an
              emerging new topic in Computational
Geometry, with applications in Graphics,
              Robotics, and
Mobile Computing.  Funding will support a small
international
              group of participants, including students and
post-docs, to get together and
              draft a list of the main
questions to be answered about this relatively new
              data
structure, and to work on solving some of them.
