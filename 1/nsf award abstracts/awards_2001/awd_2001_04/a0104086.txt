Abstract for DMS - 0104086

In his major project the investigator plans to
              continue his
work on Riemannian manifolds with positive sectional
              curvature
on open dense sets of points. A particular emphasis shall be
put on
              the question how to distinguish this class from the two
well studied classes
              of manifolds that have positive respectively
nonnegative curvature everywhere.
              In further projects the 
investigator plans to obtain rigidity 
results for
              metric foliations of Euclidean spheres and for
manifolds all of whose
              geodesics are closed.


The surfaces of eggs and footballs or the idealized
              surface of
the earth are examples of 2-dimensional Riemannian manifolds
              with
positive sectional curvature. For more than a century
              geometers
understand that surfaces with positive curvature must look
              simple.
They can not develop any holes, so they look for
              example
fundamentally different from the surface of a doughnut. In
              contrast
there are two dimensional manifolds with nonnegative
              sectional
curvature, which essentially  look like the surface of a
              doughnut.
This elementary observation reveals a fundamental
              difference
between positive and nonnegative curvature. The main aim is
              to
understand this fundamental difference and its implications in
higher
              dimensions as well.
