This
              award supports U.S. participants (primarily young researchers and graduate
              students) in the Workshop on Soliton Equations: Applications and Theory, held
              at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, on  August 10-12, 2001. The
              workshop involves interdisciplinary examination of soliton equations by experts
              in both theory and applications.  Nonlinear problems of optical communications
              are emphasized, particularly the use of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation and
              its variants for the modeling and design of long distance fiber optic
              communication systems.  Additional applied topics include the appearance of
              solitons in other optical problems, magnetic thin films, and Bose-Einstein
              condensates.  Theoretical topics include extensions of inverse scattering and
              inverse spectral theory to Schroedinger or Dirac type operators, new methods of
              analyzing Riemann-Hilbert problems, connections of soliton equations with
              geometry, and new insights into meromorphic or real analytic solutions of
              soliton equations. 

Since the initial discoveries relating the Korteweg - de
              Vries equation to the scattering
transform, soliton equations have provided a
              veritable fountain of physical and mathematical surprises.  This workshop
              offers researchers in this field a chance to exchange new results and new
              problems, and it provides young researchers with an overview of the field. The
              workshop aims at interdisciplinary presentation, with a healthy mix of
              successful applications of the ideas to physical problems, computational
              studies which can illuminate applications and suggest new theoretical issues,
              and new theoretical results.
