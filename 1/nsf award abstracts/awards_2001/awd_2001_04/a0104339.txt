Telomeres are essential for genome stability and
              continued proliferation in an undifferentiated and dedifferentiated state. 
              Arabidopsis thaliana is a useful model to elucidate the role of telomeres in
              plant growth and development and to address fundamental questions of telomere
              function in higher eukaryotes.  The investigator recently demonstrated that
              Arabidopsis can survive up to ten generations without telomerase, the enzyme
              responsible for maintaining tracts of telomeric DNA on chromosome ends.  In
              telomerase-deficient plants, telomeres shorten progressively and late
              generation mutants endure increasing levels of cytogenetic damage, correlated
              with developmental anomalies in vegetative and reproductive organs. 
              Unexpectedly, a significant subset of telomerase-deficient plants show a
              different phenotype that includes homeotic transformation in floral organs and
              leaves that curl up along the longitudinal axis.  The striking similarity of
              this phenotype to mutants defective in aspects of chromatin structure in
              Arabidopsis strongly suggests that telomere dysfunction can lead to global
              epigenetic repercussions in the regulation of gene expression.  This project
              will test whether telomere erosion is accompanied by changes in nuclear
              architecture and chromatin structure and to reveal the global transcription
              profile during successive generations of a telomerase deficiency.
