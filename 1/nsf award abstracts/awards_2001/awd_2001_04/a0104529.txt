This Americas Program award will support Dr. Frederico C.
              Furtado of the University of Wyoming and Dr. Bradley J. Plohr of SUNY at Stony
              Brook in collaboration with Dr. Dan Marchesin of the Instituto de Matematica
              Pura e Aplicada, Brazil and Dr. Felipe F. Pereira of the Instituto de
              Politecnico da Universadade do Estado Rio de Janeiro.  The team will join
              complementary expertise and technical accomplishments in mathematical analysis,
              numerical analysis, and multiphase flow to investigate the equations and
              solutions of multiphase flows in geologically heterogeneous porous
              media.

This project involves five tasks: (1) development of multiphase flow
              models that accurately account for important physical effects; (2)
              computational investigation and stochastic analysis of fluid mixing dynamics
              for these models in the presence of stochastic geologic heterogeneities; (3)
              construction of up-scaled multiphase flow models based on these results; (4)
              mathematical analysis of the solutions and non-linear wave structure; and (5)
              application of the newly developed models to technologically important flows
              such as Water-Alternating-Gas enhanced oil recovery.
