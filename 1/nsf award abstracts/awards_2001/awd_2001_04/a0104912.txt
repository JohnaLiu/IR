Deadly parasites sometimes turn into benevolent mutualists.
              Understanding the evolutionary forces that can affect this transition requires
              a model system in which both parasites and mutualists are found. A large body
              of literature exists documenting the parasitic effects of Wolbachia in the fly
              Drosophila simulans. However, our preliminary experiments with the model
              organism Drosophila melanogaster indicate that a beneficial Wolbachia strain
              inhabits this species. This mutualistic form of Wolbachia can extend the
              lifespan of D. melanogaster flies up to 35%.  This research investigates
              whether this increased lifespan leads to enhanced evolutionary fitness.  To do
              this, the investigators will compare the age-specific survival and reproduction
              of infected flies with flies that have been experimentally treated with
              antibiotics to remove Wolbachia infection.

The experiments will improve
              understanding of parasite-arthropod coevolution by characterizing a novel
              phenotype, extended lifespan, associated with Wolbachia infection. This will
              allow quantification of Wolbachia's effect on Drosophila fitness and determine
              if normally parasitic Wolbachia are becoming mutualists in Drosophila hosts.
              The Wolbachia-Drosophila symbiosis may prove useful to researchers
              investigating the virulence of parasites, and may provide an ideal system for
              testing evolutionary theories about the transition from parasitism to
              mutualism.
