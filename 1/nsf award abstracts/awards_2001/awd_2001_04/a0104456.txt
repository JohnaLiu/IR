Dr. Hooper is awarded an NSF
              Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of
              research, education, and public outreach at the University of Texas at Austin. 
               His research focuses on understanding the phenomenon of Active Galactic Nuclei
              (AGN) by constructing a sample that is broadly representative and fully
              characterized.  He will obtain spectroscopy for source characterization and the
              determination of multi-epoch luminosity functions of a subsample of objects
              observed with the Chandra X-ray telescope.   The resulting sample will
              incorporate most known AGN types and include previously hidden populations. 
              Dr. Hooper's educational activities will include participation in a science
              teacher training program, known as UTeach, being developed at the University. 
              He plans to offer an upper-division course on research methods which is aimed
              at synthesizing the students' previous course work and developing independent
              problem solving skills.
