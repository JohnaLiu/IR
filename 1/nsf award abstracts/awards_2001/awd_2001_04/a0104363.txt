Abstract for DMS - 0104363

The investigators' research focuses on
              establishing sharp geometric
inequalities that are invariant under linear or
              affine transformations
and using them to obtain new analytic inequalities.
              Since an affine
structure contains no notion of distance or angle, one might
              think that
there is little to say or do. In fact, there is a rich and deep
              theory
that already encompasses many of the most important aspects of
              Euclidean
geometry, including the sharp isoperimetric and Sobolev
              inequalities.
Most of the investigators' efforts will be devoted to developing
              and
understanding the Brunn-Minkowski theory and its generalizations.


The
              investigators' work involves some of the most fundamental objects
              in
mathematics: bodies in and functions of ordinary Euclidean space.
              These
are used to represent real objects and phenomena in science
              and
engineering. Although it is impossible to predict the future impact
              of
this work, the investigators believe that the concepts and
              techniques
developed in this project could prove to be useful in fields
              ranging from
pure mathematical areas such as differential geometry, partial
              differential
equations, and Banach spaces to more applied areas such as robot
              vision,
information theory, and stereology.
