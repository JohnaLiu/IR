Abstract for DMS - 0104453

The goal of this project is to describe all
              embedded minimal surfaces of 
some fixed (but arbitrary) genus in a fixed (but
              arbitrary) closed 
3-manifold.  Such a study would include the description of
              these surfaces on 
a fixed small scale.  Various applications of such a
              description will also 
be studied.  In particular to the spherical space-form
              problem, the topology 
of 3-manifolds with positive scalar curvature and
              various other problems in 
the topology of 3-manifolds.  Two other seperate
              projects will be 
investigated.  One is simple closed geodesics on surfaces
              and another is 
degeneration of Kahler-Einstein manifolds.


Roughly
              speaking the goal of this proposal is to describe all smooth 
soap-films.  I
              soap-film is a surface spanning a boundary and which is 
critical for area
              among all other surfaces with the same boundary.  Besides 
being a classical
              problem such a description would have many possible 
applications in a wide
              varieties of fields.  Spanning from topology to 
mathematical biology.
