This
              research is designed to study the evolutionary consequences of environmental
              change on an abundant, marine organism, Tigriopus californicus.  Changing
              climate patterns affect the temperature and salinity conditions that these
              copepods experience. The species must be able to adapt to these changes, or
              risk extinction. However, adaptation to changing ecological conditions can be a
              mixed blessing because the indirect effects of adaptation can influence many
              different aspects of the organism's lifestyle. One of the most dramatic
              secondary consequences can be the evolution of barriers to interbreeding
              between populations.  In this series of experiments, the researchers will
              maintain populations of copepods under different environmental conditions in
              the laboratory. This will simulate various kinds of climate change. Over
              sixteen generations in the laboratory, the researchers will look for evidence
              of adaptation to the new conditions at a molecular level and at the
              developmental level. In addition, they will look for indirect effects of
              climate change such as an increasing inability of copepods from different
              populations to interbreed. The results of these experiments will help
              researchers to predict the long-term, evolutionary effects of global climate
              change on crustaceans in the marine environment.
