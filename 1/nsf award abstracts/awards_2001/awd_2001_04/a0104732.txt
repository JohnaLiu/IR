Abstract    :
              Twin Cities Public Television, in association with Red Hill Studios, is
              producing and disseminating an Exploring Time television special and associated
              outreach material.  The project will augment and leverage the Exploring Time
              traveling exhibit now being developed by the Science Museum of Minnesota (NSF
              grant #99-01919).  The goal of both the exhibit and the television special is
              to increase the public's understanding of our world by revealing the unseen
              world of natural change -- the multitude of changes that are occurring in the
              present but at rates too slow or too fast to be seen.  The television special
              will provide visual explorations of changes that take place over a vast range
              of timescales -- from billionths of seconds to billions of years.

The
              television series and exhibit will be supplemented by a range of materials. 
              Both low- and high-bandwidth, web-based material will be available and a
              teacher's guide will be developed for middle school classrooms.  A "Time
              Explorers Toolkit" will be available to both formal and informal learners. 
              This CD-ROM includes detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to create
              time-lapse movies.  The project also will coordinate outreach with the
              Community Technology Centers Network, the organization that supports technology
              centers that serve individuals from underrepresented and low-income groups.
