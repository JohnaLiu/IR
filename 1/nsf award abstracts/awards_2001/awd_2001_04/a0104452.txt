This one-year award will support a dissertation
              enhancement project of Jesse Dosher, a student in the Biorobotics Lab of the
              Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Washington.  He will
              work with Prof. Massimo Bergamasco at the PERCRO lab at Scuola Superiore Santa
              Anna in Pisa, Italy. The objective of Mr. Dosher's research is to improve the
              design of  the Biorobotics Lab's new control method for haptic devices.  While
              at PERCRO, one of the world's leading laboratories in haptic device
              mechanization, Mr. Dosher will learn state of the art materials, mechanization,
              and fabrication techniques for haptic device design. While at PERCRO, Mr.
              Dosher will offer seminars on the Biorobotics Lab's new control method for
              haptic devices.
