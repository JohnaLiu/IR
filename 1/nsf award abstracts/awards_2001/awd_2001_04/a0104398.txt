Dr. McLaughlin will carry out a program of
              research as an MPS Distinguished International Postdoctoral Research Fellow at
              Jodrell Bank Observatory.  She will study pulsars, the rapidly rotating, highly
              magnetized neutron stars which emit pulses that are detected once per rotation.
               Pulsars have many astrophysical applications, including strong-field gravity,
              condensed matter physics, particle physics, planetary astronomy, and even
              cosmology.  While pulsars radiate across the entire electromagnetic spectrum,
              there are over 1100 known radio pulsars and only 40 known X-ray and/or
              gamma-ray pulsars.  Consequently, the relationship between low- and high-energy
              emission and the emission processes themselves are not well-understood.  This
              research program will lead to a more complete census of the pulsar population,
              a better understanding of emission mechanisms, and the discovery of unique
              individual objects.  Techniques for discovery will include radio searches for
              counterparts to high-energy sources and pulsars that are likely to be
              detectable at high energies, as well as high-energy searches, spectroscopy, and
              imaging.   This research is funded through the Office of Multidisciplinary
              Activities in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
