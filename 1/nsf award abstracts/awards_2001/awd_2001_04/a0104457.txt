Abstract    :
              Professor Daniel Romo in the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University is
              supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his
              development of concise and practical enantioselective syntheses of
              beta-lactones via nucleophile catalyzed aldol-lactonizations (NCALs) of ketenes
              and aldehydes.  Novel transformations of these beta-lactones to form various
              heterocyclic structures will be explored.  The utility of the intramolecular
              NCAL reaction will be illustrated by the total synthesis of a lactacystin
              analog and an enantioselective synthesis of the natural product, brefeldin A. 
              Mechanistic studies on the NCAL reaction will be carried out using REACT IR and
              1H NMR.

With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Program,
              Professor Romo is developing novel methods by which certain highly strained
              organic compounds can be prepared with precise control of their
              three-dimensional structure.  These compounds serve as intermediates which can
              be further converted to more complex products, many of which are share similar
              structural features with pharmacologically active compounds.
