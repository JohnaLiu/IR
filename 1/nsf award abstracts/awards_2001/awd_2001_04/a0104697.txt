Abstract    :
              "Project Splash" is a 24-month project targeting middle school students (grades
              7-9) from predominately immigrant and refugee backgrounds.  Although numerous
              partnerships are highlighted throughout the proposal, the main partnerships
              include the University of Massachusetts Lowell, the Lowell Heritage State Park,
              the Lowell Housing Authority, the New England Board of Higher Education AQUA
              Educators' Network, GEARUP, Salem State College, Lowell High School, the New
              England Aquarium, and Lowell's Youth Leaders, the River Ambassadors.  Two
              cohorts of 25 youth (a total of 50 students) will participate in after school
              and summer academic activities.  Activities will link culture and science
              through hands-on environmental experiences with science leaders and cultural
              representatives.  Students will participate in "Project Splash" two hours a day
              twice a week during the academic year and summer.  Transportation will be
              provided to all program activities.
