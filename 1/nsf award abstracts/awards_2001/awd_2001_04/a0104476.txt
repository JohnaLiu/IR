Abstract    :
              This project provides for international technology assessments and related
              workshop and staff support.  While a division of Loyola College, the World
              Technology Evaluation Center conducted over 50 such technology assessments
              using a peer review methodology that many believe is the best single method for
              evaluation of research and development abroad.  The objectives include seeking
              technologies to transfer to the U.S., evaluating the position of U.S. science
              and technology with respect to leading competitors, and seeking opportunities
              for international cooperation in research.
