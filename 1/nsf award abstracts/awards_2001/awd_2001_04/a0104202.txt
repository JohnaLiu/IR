The recent Cerro Grande and Viveash wildfires in New Mexico
              provide a unique opportunity to study the early effects of intensive
              regeneration efforts on two distinct forest types. Over 720,000 poinds of seed,
              most of which was non-native grasses, was applied to the Cerro Grande burn site
              over this summer. Similarly, 230,000 pounds of seed were also applied to the
              Viveash site. Review of the literature suggests that ecological studies
              evaluating the effects of reseeding, particularly with non-native species, have
              not been conducted in such southwestern forest ecosystems. This project will
              monitor the establishment and distribution of introduced, seeded and post-fire
              native emergent species in the first two growing seasons following the
              wildfires. Data collected in this exploratory study will be used to test
              spatially explicit models that predict patterns of distribution and persistence
              among introduced and native plant species in seeded and unseeded burned areas.
              These models are useful in examining the long-term effectiveness of reseeding
              and the effects of introducing non-ntaive species on patterns of recovery and
              succession in mid-elevation Ponderosa pine and high-elevation spruce/fir forest
              systems.
