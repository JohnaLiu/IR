This award supports Arun Phadke and Virgilio Centano of
              Virginia Polytechnic and State U. in a collaboration with Hans Ottosson of
              Enersearch AB in Malmo, Sweden.  The research will focus on catastrophic
              failure of power networks, exploration of methods for damage assessment,
              control, and restoration of electric power grids following catastrophic
              disturbances.  Disturbances to be studied include natural disasters such as
              earthquakes and tornadoes, and man-made disasters such as terrorist attacks and
              human error.  The Virginia Tech group will concentrate on information system
              infrastructure overview, computer networks, and electric power networks for
              robustness in the face of catastrophic events.  The Swedish group will make
              substantial contributions in each area, and will be able to offer ways to
              enhance infrastructures for improved performance.  Catastrophic failures of
              power networks are a universal phenomenon, and restoration of service to lost
              loads occupies the interest of engineers throughout the world.  In particular,
              there is a significant pool of knowledge on these topics in Northern Europe,
              which this collaboration will
