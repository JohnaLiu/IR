This proposal is concerned with the global
              existence and 
cosmic censorship problems for the Einstein equation, and
              
related issues in Lorentzian and Riemannian geometry. One of 
the primary
              goals is to prove a nonlinear stability result 
for the Einstein equation in
              the cosmological case. For large 
data, global existence is a very hard
              problem, and here the 
aim is to identify and study model problems as well as
              lower dimensional problems derived by symmetry reductions. The 
structure of
              cosmological singularities will be studied 
from the point of view of the BKL
              proposal.  For flat, 
spatially compact spacetimes, global constant mean
              curvature
foliations will be studied, in particular their asymptotic
              
behavior in the expanding direction and near the singularity.

The Einstein
              equation, which describes the interaction of 
matter with spacetime geometry,
              is one of the fundamental 
classical field equations of modern physics.
              According to the 
world view of modern physics, our universe is described on
              
large scales by one of the simplest solutions to the Einstein equations, the
              Friedman-Lemaitre solution. According to this
picture, the universe has
              developed from a singularity (big bang) 
and is expanding. The work in this
              project is concerned with 
the nonlinear stability of this model, the behavior
              of spacetime 
in extreme conditions near the big bang and its ultimate fate
              
in the expanding direction.
