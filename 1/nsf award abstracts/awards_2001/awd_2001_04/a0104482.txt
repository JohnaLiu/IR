Abstract    :
              Preliminary work by the PIs has shown that application-level information can be
              exploited to greatly reduce the amount of redundancy required to deal with
              transient failures, which are by far the most common type of failure.  For
              example, in a radar target-tracking application, our approach required only 15%
              redundancy to provide complete fault-tolerance against transient faults. 
              Another use of ALFT is in providing a temporary patch in the event of a
              permanent processor failure, allowing the system more time to execute a
              recovery algorithm.

ALFT is orthogonal to other approaches to
              fault-tolerance, so that it can be used either by itself or in combination with
              them.  For example, a designer might use ALFT to guard against transients, and
              make a small amount of hardware redundancy available, in the form of
              line-replaceable spares, to deal with permanent failures.

The objective of
              this project is to develop Application-Level Fault Tolerance strategies and
              investigate their
effectiveness for various classes of real-time applications.
               The main focus will be to generalize our approach to include as many different
              types of applications as possible, develop the most suitable strategy for each
              application type and evaluate the efficiency of the developed scheme.
