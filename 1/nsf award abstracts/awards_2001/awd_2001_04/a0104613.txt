Abstract    :
              Native Waters is a comprehensive four-year tribal science education program
              focused on water.  Working closely with leaders from 28 Missouri River Basin
              Tribes, the project will explore the Missouri River Flood Basin from a
              scientific and cultural standpoint.  Partners are The Watercourse and
              International Project WET (Water Education for Teachers).  Activities include
              Leadership Institutes for community educators and Native Waters Future Leaders
              Camps for secondary school and college students.  Products to be developed
              include an interactive traveling exhibit, which will focus on the Missouri
              River watershed and the physical properties of water, as well as its uses from
              a cultural and scientific standpoint.  The exhibit will travel to cultural
              centers, tribal colleges and school libraries throughout the ten Missouri River
              Basin states.  A 250-page Native Water's Educators Guide will be disseminated
              nationally and impact over 500,000 individuals, both youth and adults. 
              Finally, a 16-page student activity book and a Native Waters film will be
              produced to introduce youth and community members to water resource issues. The
              training materials will be used in cultural centers, museums, area water
              councils and schools.
