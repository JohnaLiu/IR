Abstract    :
              This award is for NSF sponsorship of the first national conference on the Social
              and Economic Implications of Information Technology (IT). The two-day
              conference will bring together academic researchers, commercial research and
              consulting firms and the policy community to review research that contributes
              to a broad and contextual understanding of social and economic change, as it
              relates to IT. It will stimulate debate on research strategies, policy
              implications and a future research agenda, and it will offer a prototype annual
              conference for this area of research. The conference will reflect the concerns
              of the Presidents Information Technology Advisory Committee (PITAC) that we
              have insufficient scientific understanding of the actual scope and trajectory
              of the socio-technical transformations related to IT and that we need to build
              a national infrastructure to support this area of research.
