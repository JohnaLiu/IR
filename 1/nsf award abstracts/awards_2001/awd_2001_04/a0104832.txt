The investigators will determine the extent that ecological
              and genetic factors play on the reproductive isolation between two closely
              related freshwater fish species in California (Lavinia symmetricus and L.
              exilicauda).  The two species occur together in two separate drainages: Clear
              Lake and Monterey Bay rivers.  Levels of reproductive isolation between the two
              species differ in the two drainages with extensive hybridization occurring in
              only one of the drainages.  The investigators will produce crosses between the
              two species in the laboratory to measure performance of the hybrids against the
              pure crosses.   

Processes that allow the formation of new species have been
              a central focus in biology.  Groups of individuals in a rapidly radiating
              species that have recently become isolated can be analyzed to determine which
              factors are contributing to reproductive isolation.  Other research has shown
              that there are two types of processes contributing to rapid radiations:
              ecological and genetic.  Much of the empirical research on radiations in
              closely related species has focused on ecological factors.  Recent work has
              revealed that genetic incompatibilities between closely related species may be
              more prevalent than believed.  Results from this study will allow a greater
              understanding of the processes that promote speciation and diversification.
