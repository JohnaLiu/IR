Abstract    :
              AMNH ASCEND is a new model afterschool program of the American Museum of Natural
              History in New York City.  AMNH ASCEND focuses on the legal, ethical, social
              and cultural implications of new discoveries in genetics.  Eighty New York City
              high school students will be involved in a two-year program that includes a
              series of courses, hands-on activities, laboratory experiences, field trips,
              career development opportunities and educational support.  In the first year
              students will participate in seven-week laboratory courses on genomic
              technology followed in the second year by a research experience in genomics at
              the Museum.  The project is a collaboration of AMNH with AAAS, Mount Sinai
              School of Medicine, the City University of New York and the New York City Board
              of Education.
