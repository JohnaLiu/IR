              ABSTRACT

Models  for Kerogen  Oxidation, the  Carbon Cycle,
and Atmospheric 
              Oxygen   over Phanerozoic Time

Change over geologic time in the level of
              atmospheric oxygen is both a principal cause and principal effect of biological
              evolution, and, thus, study of such change is of interest to both the earth and
              biological sciences. One the four basic processes controlling the level of
              atmospheric O2 over time is the removal of O2 by the oxidative weathering of
              organic matter (kerogen) in sedimentary rocks. We propose to construct
              theoretical models to quantitatively evaluate the role of O2 in the rate and
              mechanism of kerogen weathering and help decide whether or not the rate
              limiting step in such weathering is simply the exposure of fresh kerogen by
              physical erosion. As a check on the modeling we will turn to the field
              measurements of kerogen weathering that have been done under our previous NSF
              grant.
 In addition, we propose to combine already existing simple models for
              the evolution of atmospheric O2 over the past 550 million years (Phanerozoic
              time) with an already published much more complex model for the evolution of
              atmospheric CO2 that considers such processes as mountain uplift, continental
              drift, and climate change. Combined with our model results on kerogen
              weathering, we hope to be able to construct a complete model for the evolution
              of both atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide and to relate changes in the two
              gases to biological evolution and climate change.
