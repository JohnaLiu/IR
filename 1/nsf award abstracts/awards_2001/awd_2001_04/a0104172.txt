Abstract    :
              This award supports the travel, housing and registration costs of 18 students
              who would not otherwise be able to attend the 5th International Conference on
              Autonomous Agents (Agents 2001) to be held in Montreal, Canada, May 28- June 1,
              2001. This conference is the premier conference on agent technology and will
              have associated with it many tutorials, workshops and other events given by
              leading researchers in this field. One valuable part of student training is
              participation in the excitement of an international conference where major
              researchers present their work and engage one another in dialogue. The goal of
              this proposal is to enable students who are deserving but may not have the
              financial resources available to attend. A committee of senior agents
              researchers and conference organizers has been formed to select students based
              on the following criteria: 1) those presenting papers or software systems; 2)
              those presenting in workshops or other associated conference forums; 3) those
              demonstrating financial need; and 4) new students to the area demonstrating
              benefit from attendance.
