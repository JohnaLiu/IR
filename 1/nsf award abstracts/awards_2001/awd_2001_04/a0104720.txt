Abstract    :
              Oregon State University will expand its successful Master Science Educators
              program and create a national model for the delivery of natural science
              education to elementary and middle school youth.  Master Science Educators are
              volunteers who undergo a rigorous 30-hour training and commit to 50 hours of
              service to a community site, such as a community center, housing project or
              school.  Volunteers work in teams of two so that each site receives 100 hours
              of service devoted to the research and development of a natural science
              project.  Volunteers and on-site and off-site scientists who act as virtual
              volunteers,  guide youth ages K-8, in the design, development and evaluation of
              their project.  Wildlife habitat projects provide a means for participants to
              learn inquiry and are tailored to address local science standards.  A trainer's
              guide, a volunteer handbook, a guide for community sites and promotional and
              training videos will be produced, as well as a web-based science course.  It is
              anticipated that 240 volunteers will be trained to work with over 12,000 youth
              during the course of the project.  Dissemination will occur through the 4-H
              Extension service, impacting both urban and rural populations.
