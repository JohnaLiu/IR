This U.S.-Mexico Program award will provide support for
              dissertation research by Mr. John Harrison, under the direction of Dr. Pamela
              Matson of Stanford University.  Mr. Harrrison will work in Mexico with Dr. Ivan
              Ortiz-Monasterio on the Wheat Program at the International Wheat and Maize
              Improvement Center (CYMMYT) in Obregon, Mexico.  The investigators will study
              the emissions of nitrous oxide from waters draining the Yaqui Basin in Mexico.
              

Nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas that is increasing globally and the
              fertilization of agricultural fields is thought to be the single most important
              source of the observed increase.  The Yaqui Valley provides a unique
              opportunity to look at the interactions of several kinds of anthropogenic
              change that are important drivers of biogeochemical change. Results from this
              study should improve our basic understanding of nitrous oxide emissions from
              agricultural drainage and the factors that control them.
