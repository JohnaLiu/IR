Abstract    :
              0123342  Raskin  The objective of this research is to develop and optimize
              biologically active carbon (BAC) filtration systems to remove low
              concentrations of perchlorate from drinking water.  These systems must produce
              water that meets all regulatory standards, is biologically stable so that its
              quality does not degrade during distribution, is free of odorous substances,
              and has a low chlorine demand so that excessive chlorination by-product
              formation will not be an issue.  The proposed research could result in an
              efficient, bench-scale perchlorate treatment process that can produce water
              meeting these requirements. The specific objectives are: (1) to develop methods
              for microbial identification and quantification in BAC filters, (2) to develop
              a biofilm modeling approach for optimizing BAC filter operation and design, and
              (3) to integrate process engineering optimization, microbial characterization
              and biofilm modeling. ***
