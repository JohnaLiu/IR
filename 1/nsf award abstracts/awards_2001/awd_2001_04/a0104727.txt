This project will study complex and real
              algebraic
hypersurfaces from a topological perspective. In
particular it will
              study the interrelation of their
topological and algebraic properties. This
              subject
recently got a new powerful tool, the so-called
theory of amoebas.
              Mikhalkin will work on further
developing this theory and will make use of
              amoebas
for investigating algebraic varieties. Amoebas have
already proved to
              be an extremely useful tool in
several areas of Mathematics, including
              Algebraic
Geometry, Topology and Complex Analysis. Earlier
Mikhalkin used
              this tool in the proof of topological
uniqueness  of maximal arrangements of
              plane real
algebraic curves (in the context of Hilbert's 16th
problem). A
              part of the project is to obtain a
generalization of this result in higher
              dimensions.
The other part of the project is based on the same
technique but
              will investigate complex algebraic
hypersurfaces by constructing and analyzing
              certain
singular Lagrangian fibrations over PL-complexes.
Such fibrations
              give a hope to extract topology
hidden in the Hodge structure of algebraic
              varieties.

Algebraic varieties and, in particular, real algebraic
varieties
              are fundamental mathematical objects naturally
occuring in modern-day Physics,
              Optics, Mechanics and
Robotics. For instance, all possible positions of
              a
mechanical linkage (e.g. an arm of a robot) form a real
algebraic variety.
              The question of topological classification
of plane real algebraic curves
              (1-dimensional varieties)
posed by Hilbert over 100 years ago is still open.
              A
recent advance by Mikhalkin in this problem relied on
a new mathematical
              notion, that of amoeba, introduced
by Gelfand, Kapranov and Zelevinski.
              Algebraic amoebas
are regions in space which are associated to
              varieties.
These concave regions with "tentacles" and "vacuoles"
resemble in
              shape biological amoebas.
