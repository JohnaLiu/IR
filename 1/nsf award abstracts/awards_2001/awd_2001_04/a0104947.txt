Abstract    :
              Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha), a common rangeland grass, is
              frequently infected by a fungus (Atkinsonella texensis) that sterilizes the
              plant.  Infected plants, however, may grow faster and be more likely to survive
              than uninfected plants.  This study will determine whether this is true, by
              testing three different hypotheses: (a) The fungus may directly cause infected
              plants to grow faster and be more likely to survive.  (b) Infected plants may
              recover from being eaten by insects better than uninfected plants, perhaps
              because they are larger.  (c) Infection may make a plant less likely to be
              eaten by insects, perhaps because the fungus produces distasteful chemicals. 
              This study will also test whether fungal infection affects a plant's ability to
              compete with other plants for light, water, and nutrients.  Although fungi
              probably play very important roles in natural ecosystems, their roles are
              poorly known; this study will help fill this gap.
