Abstract    :
              The Worcester Pipeline Collaborative ASCEND Initiative will offer Worcester
              youth long-term, academic research projects/partnerships, summer research
              projections for high school students and self-directed research projects for
              middle and high school students and a summer science camp and after schools
              science club for middle school students.  The long-term project goal is to
              enhance scientific literacy in Central Massachusetts by preparing students
              interested in science skills with the necessary skills.  This is especially
              important in an urban community whose traditional manufacturing base is being
              replaced by technological and health industries.
