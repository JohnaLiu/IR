Dr. Hurley-Keller is awarded
              an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a
              program of research and education at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). 
              She will carry out a photometric survey of dwarf galaxy satellite systems
              around isolated spiral galaxies, which will provide constraints both on the
              evolution of disk galaxy stellar populations and their dark matter halos.  The
              survey will be conducted with the CWRU Burrell Schmidt telescope and will reach
              fainter than other studies of isolated systems and will sample dwarf spheroidal
              populations throughout the dark halos of these galaxies.  With this survey, she
              will be able to investigate two primary issues: 1) the relationship between the
              properties of a galaxy's disk/halo/bulge and of its satellite system, and 2)
              the constraints that numbers of dwarf galaxies place on various cold dark
              matter models and their predictions.  Dr. Hurley-Keller will also design and
              offer an undergraduate course for non-majors in which students explore the
              process of science by focusing less on the material content and more on
              'thinking like a scientist' in the context of both historical and current
              astronomical problems.
