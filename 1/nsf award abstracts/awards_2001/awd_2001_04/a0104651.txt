Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funding for a 3-year After School Centers For Exploration
              and New Discovery (ASCEND) project for middle school students and their
              families.  The Science and Engineering Experiences for Knowledge (SEEK) project
              will enroll 60 students during Year 1, 120 students during Year 2, and 180
              students during Year 3. The students will engage in investigative projects that
              explore the program theme, "Florida's Environment:  Past, Present, and Future."
              Activities include individual and group projects, field trips, family projects
              at home, parental involvement, and project presentations at the museum for
              other middle school students and museum visitors.  Project activities in the
              first year will engage the students in learning about Florida's geological and
              biological history and global change environment through the study of insects. 
              In the second year students will be introduced to Florida's present environment
              through the study of insects. During the third year, students will investigate
              factors that will influcence Florida's future environment such as habitats,
              weather and recycling.  The students will meet two times a week (3:30 p.m. -
              5:30p.m.) during the school year.  The project is a collaborative effort
              involving the University of Florida's Florida Museum of Natural History and its
              College of Engineering, The Alachua County School Board and the Gainesville
              Regional Utilities.
