This award will provide funds to offset participant
              costs for the Geological Society of America (GSA) Penrose Conference entitled
              "Longevity and Dynamics of Large Silicic Systems" that will be held at Mammoth
              Lakes, California on June 14-21, 2001.  The funds will be used to provide
              support for travel and registration of students and early-career researchers
              that will be selected on the basis of need.  The applicants for those funds
              will be asked to provide a curriculum vitae, a poster title for a presentation
              at the meeting, and a statement of financial need.  The results of the
              conference will be published on GSA Today  and posted on the GSA web site.
