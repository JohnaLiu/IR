	The goal of this research is to examine how body size affects the
              respiratory physiology of active insects.  Initial results show that
              larger/older grasshoppers fatigue quicker during repeated jumping, which
              suggests possible problems with oxygen delivery to the muscle.  This project
              utilizes American locusts (Schistocerca americana) to determine how structural
              changes in both the respiratory tracheal system and the jumping muscle vary
              with body size during development.  The tracheal structure will be measured
              using light and electron microscopy, while the leg muscle metabolic
              biochemistry will be measured using enzymatic assays.  The amount of oxygen
              consumed during jumping will be measured for the whole animal using
              flow-through respirometry and leg muscle oxygen levels will be measured with
              electron paramagnetic resonance.  The results of this project will help
              understand the general relationship between body size and tracheal function and
              provide a test of the hypothesis that gigantic insects of the Paleozoic Era
              were made possible by increased atmospheric oxygen levels.
