Abstract    :
              "Kinetic City After School" is a two-year project that will produce a web-based
              after-school program for children ages 9-11.  The on-line adventure will enable
              users to enter a virtual universe where a computer virus (Deep Delete)
              systematically attacks a new area of science each month (analogous to one of
              the 12 Project 2061 Benchmarks for Science Literacy).  As students battle the
              virus, they learn Benchmarks learning goals.  Each unit invites children to
              think about the problem, take action and reflect on their experience.  The
              activities accommodate different learning styles and are supplemented by live
              audio chats with scientists and a self-assessment enables students to earn
              Kinetic City Power Points.  Power Points can be donated to after school
              programs without computers and Internet access.  These sites may in turn,
              exchange their accumulated Power Points to obtain computers, Internet service
              and a site license for "Kinetic City After School."  Although the program is
              web-based, most of the activity extensions are done off-line.  "Kinetic City
              After School" will be introduced to after-school sites with a two-day training
              workshop, with follow-up via phone meetings and site visits.  Supporting
              materials will include a Leader Guide, Journal and Kinetic City Home Crew
              activity pages for use in the home.
