This two-year award, which supports U.S.-Spain cooperative
              research on modeling grass and shrub vegetation recovery after disturbance,
              using product imaging techniques to investigate molecular dynamics, involves
              Miguel Acevedo of the University of North Texas and Jose Bonvehi at the
              University of Alicante, Spain.  The objectives of their research are to develop
              individual-based models for vegetation regeneration, and to develop scale-up
              methods by estimating parameters of the simpler transition models from the
              individual-based models.

The U. S. investigator brings to this collaboration
              his experience with modeling and spatial analysis.  This is complemented by the
              Spanish investigators' expertise in modeling population and community dynamics
              and his data sets on tropical grass growth and grass/shrub recovery dynamics
              after disturbance events. The results of this research are expected to provide
              an understanding of vegetable dynamics in soil useful to conservation efforts
              and ecological restoration, and to assessing their influence on geochemical
              cycles.
