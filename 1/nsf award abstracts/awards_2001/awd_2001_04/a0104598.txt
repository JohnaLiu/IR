In plants, gene movement is mediated either via pollen or
              seeds.  In most flowering plants, pollen can potentially travel much greater
              distances than seeds.  Orchids, however, are capable of considerable
              long-distance seed dispersal while pollen flow is limited to the range of
              pollinator movement. What is the relative contribution of pollen and seed
              dispersal to overall partitioning of genetic variation?  How much gene movement
              occurs in disturbed habitats and what is the spatial scale of that movement? 
              To address these questions, the distribution of genetic diversity in the
              neotropical, epiphytic orchid, Laelia rubescens, will be examined at multiple
              spatial scales using biparentally inherited nuclear markers (allozymes) and
              maternally inherited chloroplast sequence markers. 

Genetic diversity is
              crucial for the long-tern survival of species, particularly in fragmented and
              disturbed landscapes which are becoming increasingly ubiquitous.  It increases
              the likelihood that a species can survive environmental fluctuations and
              natural catastrophes that invariably occur over time. By better understanding
              how pollen and seed dispersal impact the distribution of genetic diversity in
              this orchid, insights will be gained into how forest fragmentation influences
              genetic viability and how species with long-distance seed dispersal
              capabilities may preserve genetic variation and thereby facilitate their
              long-term survival in highly disturbed habitats.
