Abstract    :
              This project explores the manner in which morphology has evolved over the course
              of the 40 million year history of the deep-sea ostracode genus Poseidonamicus.
              Fossil and modern specimens will be studied using scanning electron microscopy.
              Features of the ostracode carapace will be measured using the digital images
              obtained, and patterns of morphological change over time will be reconstructed.
              From these data, it will be determined if features that are more variable
              within populations are also more likely to evolve. 

This study will be one
              of the first to use the fossil record to determine if patterns of variation
              affect the direction of long-term evolutionary change. While the evolutionary
              importance of these patterns is well understood over the course of a few
              generations, it is not clear whether trait variability matters for long-term
              evolution. Several researchers have suggested that patterns of variation should
              act to bias or constrain the course of evolution, even over long time stretches
              of time. The proposed research uses the evolutionary history of a taxon with a
              rich fossil record to test these suggestions.
