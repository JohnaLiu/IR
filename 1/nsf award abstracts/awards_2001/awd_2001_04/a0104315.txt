This U.S.-Argentina Program award will provide support for
              cooperative research between Dr. Ignacio Grossmann of Carnegie-Mellon
              University and Drs. Jaime Cerda and Aldo Vecchietti of Universidad Nacional del
              Litoral in Santa Fe, Argentina.  Their work is in the integration of
              disjunctive programming and constrained logic programming for the design and
              scheduling of process systems.
This project will introduce recent advances on
              generalized disjunctive programming and constrained logic programming to the
              combinatorial problems that come up in scheduling of process systems.  The
              collaborators will concentrate on short term mixed batch/continuous
              multiproduct scheduling and design models.  Dr. Grossmann has experience in the
              area of mixed integer linear and nonlinear optimization and its applications in
              a variety of areas including process operations problems, while Dr. Cerda has
              expertise in heat exchanger network synthesis as well as process scheduling
              problems.  Results of this work will have applications in design, scheduling,
              and control, as well as in a variety of engineering and science areas.
