This project
              is a study of nonlinear hyperbolic waves and their interactions.  Waves are
              ubiquitous in science, and a general understanding of their interactions is of
              fundamental interest and importance.  This project will systematically develop
              a dual framework for understanding waves and their interactions, via direct and
              asymptotic methods.  Interacting pairs of waves are described in detail, and
              are combined in a coherent fashion to describe the structure of general
              solutions.  These methods will be applied to several important systems of
              continuum mechanics.

The mathematical theory of waves lies at the
              intersection of mathematics and physics and has application to many engineering
              problems.  This project develops methods for understanding the results of wave
              interactions in general systems.  The results obtained in this study will be of
              use in experimentally measuring material properties of elastic solids.
