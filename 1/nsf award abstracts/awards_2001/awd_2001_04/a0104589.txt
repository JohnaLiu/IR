Abstract    :
              "MarsQuest Online" is an exploration-based website designed to complement the
              innovative MarsQuest traveling exhibit launched by the Space Science Institute
              (SSI) in 1997.  "MarsQuest Online" will enhance and extend the exhibit, which
              is currently on a six-year, 18-city tour.  TERC, working in collaboration with
              the Space Science Institute and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), will
              create a virtual version of the exhibit using software such as Java, Quicktime
              VR and JPL's sophisticated MarsNet Viewer system.  Users will be immersed in an
              integrated, interactive environment complete with the tools and resources to
              carry out investigations and enhance inquiry-based learning.  "MarsQuest" will
              expand users' understanding of the history of Mars, scientific exploration, the
              climate and related earth science concepts, while enabling them to follow the
              exploration of various landers and orbiters, and access NASA scientists.  A
              diverse collection of Guided Inquiry experiences will foster the ability of
              users to develop inquiry and analysis skills, while offering options for
              novice, intermediate and advanced learners.  Finally, a comprehensive
              evaluation plan will examine how the website and exhibit compare in promoting
              the understanding of science, broadening public interest in space exploration,
              and motivating further learning.  The site will be promoted for use by schools
              as a tool for teaching earth science and space exploration.  It is estimated
              that 300,000 people will visit "MarsQuest Online" annually.
