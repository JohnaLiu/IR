Dr. Johnson is awarded an NSF
              Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of
              research, education, and public outreach at the University of Wisconsin and at
              the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Socorro.  Her research program
              focuses on the study of the earliest stages of massive star clusters.   She
              will use panchromatic data, from the radio to the near-infrared, to study the
              physical properties of the star clusters as they evolve from being completely
              enshrouded to being dominated by stellar light.   Study of these clusters
              provides knowledge of the conditions required for the formation of massive star
              clusters and their physical properties at different stages in their
              development.  Dr. Johnson will also carry out a program of undergraduate
              education, community outreach, and minority participation and recruitment.
