The
              proposers plan to continue their work on a variety of
problems bearing on the
              understanding of the geometric and
topological aspects of low dimensional
              manifolds.  On the
topological side, the areas of study include Heegaard
              splittings,
unknotting tunnels and related topics; the geometric side
              deals
with issues related to orbifolds, the construction and melding
              of
surface subgroups, developing an understanding of higher
dimensional
              hyperbolic manifolds, as well as some interactions
with other areas, for
              example algebraic number theory.

Manifolds play a central role in physics,
              mathematics and to some
extent in other sciences, since they are objects which
              on small
scales look like Euclidean space of dimension n.  For example,
the
              space that we live in is a three manifold and space-time is a
four manifold. 
              For this and other reasons, these dimensions have
attracted a good deal of
              attention in mathematics and physics.
One basic unsolved problem is exactly
              which manifold is the
correct model for the universe - there has been some
              speculation
that it falls into the class of so-called hyperbolic manifolds,
              a
certain class of three dimensional spaces which in some sense
appear to be
              generic.  Cosmological theories about the origins of
the universe put
              constraints on the shape of space-time and hence
constraints on which
              manifolds could occur.  One of the goals of
this project is refine current
              methods (which have already ruled
out many possibilities) to narrow the search
              down further.  There
are also other applications of geometric ideas which are
              less
obvious but still, in fact, directly important.  It is no
exaggeration
              to say that almost any problem which can be
formulated qualitatively can be
              studied with geometric methods
and as a result the powerful tools developed
              over the last thirty
years in low-dimensional topology can be brought to bear
              upon it.
