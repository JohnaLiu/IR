Abstract    :
              Maine Public Broadcasting Corporation is producing three seasons of a regional
              television series that will enable audiences to explore, appreciate and learn
              about the relationship between science and everyday life in Northern New
              England.  The project is being developed in collaboration with public
              television stations in Vermont and New Hampshire and will attract viewers by
              focusing on content and issues that are of unique interest to this area.  It
              addresses the critical need to improve science literacy in this predominantly
              rural region of the country.  Ancillary materials will be developed for use at
              home, in the community, and in classrooms and will consist of:  Quest
              "Take-Home" Activity Pages, "In Your Community" Guides, Quest Community Events,
              and Classroom Lesson Plans and Suggested Activities.
