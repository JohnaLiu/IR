Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funding for an after-school program in science for 2,000
              middle school students in grades 6-8.  The proposed after-school Imperial
              Valley Agriculture Learning Center project is designed to engage
              underrepresented groups of middle school students in sustentative after-school
              activities in specific areas of science, mathematics and technology.  The
              science content will focus on agricultural science and will include topics such
              as entomology, soils, meteorology and genetically modified crops.  Four
              twelve-week programs will be offered each year and students will attend two
              sessions per week (after school).

The project is a cooperative initiative
              between El Centro School District, The Valley Imperial Project in Science LSC,
              The San Diego State University-Imperial Valley Campus and the University of
              California, Division of Agricultural and Natural Resources, Desert Research and
              Extension Center.
