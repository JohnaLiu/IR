Jong-Shih, here's the
              abstract for my proposal "Variational Analysis 
in Problems of Optimization".

This project
              will apply the latest advances in variational analysis to  
a range of
              optimization problems and issues.  Sensitivity and metric 
regularity in
              parametric dependence will be studied.  Second-order 
optimality conditions
              will be devised for new purposes and from 
nonstandard perspectives. 
              Connections between cost-to-go functions and 
feedback for certain kinds of
              optimal control will be explored along  
with the specialization to a control
              framework of recently generalized 
Euler-Lagrange equations and Hamiltonian
              equations.  New risk models and 
splitting algorithms will be developed in
              stochastic programming, where 
decisions must be made optimally in advance of
              full information. 
 
These efforts are needed because problems of
              optimization, which are 
of great importance in many applications from
              management to engineering, 
are not well covered by standard mathematics of
              the past and have 
required new ways of thinking.  In such problems, centered
              on minimizing 
"cost" or maximizing "efficiency", for instance, there usually
              are very 
many side conditions that have to be satisfied, and moreover the
              number  
of decision variables to be coped with can be enormous---in the
              thousands  
or even millions.  It is crucial to have a solid foundation for
              the  
development of numerical methods for finding solutions and understanding
               
the effects that shifts in input data might have on those solutions.  
The
              work to be performed will further the progress in those directions.
