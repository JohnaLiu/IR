Polygonal knot theory studies the isotopy classes of
              embedded
polygons in three space where the number and length of edges
              are
fixed throughout the isotopy.  The PI and co-author have found
the first
              examples of polygons which are topologically unknotted,
but for which the
              isotopy class of embeddings is nontrivial. The
PI and student collaborators
              will investigate questions such as
whether or not there are any such examples
              for equilateral
polygons. Surgery theory studies the set of manifold
              structures
within a given homotopy type. The
              Bryant-Ferry-Mio-Weinberger
surgery exact sequence for homology manifolds has
              been used by
the PI to prove that up to s-cobordism many of the
              geometric
properties of manifolds also hold for homology manifolds.
              The
Novikov conjecture and related coarse Novikov conjecture are keys
to our
              understanding of surgery theory.  The PI has developed
some techniques for
              attacking the coarse Novikov conjecture for
unusual non uniformly contractible
              spaces. Controlled and bounded
surgery theory will be used to further
              investigate homology
manifolds and the coarse Novikov conjecture.

Up to
              now, topologists have studied well-behaved spaces such as
manifolds.  Yet
              singular spaces arise more and more frequently in
subjects such as analysis,
              algebraic geometry and physics.  The
non-resolvable homology manifolds studied
              in this project are so
singular that they have no points whatsoever with
              Euclidean
neighborhoods.  Perhaps these strange spaces will someday
              account
for the extra dimensions of the universe predicted by string
theory.
              Coarse geometry, and the coarse homology of John Roe are
ways of separating
              the large scale behavior of spaces from the
local information.  The invariants
              of coarse geometry and
topology depend only on the large scale behavior of
              the
space. Better understanding of these objects and their invariants
will
              help topologists to classify the different types of singular
spaces, which
              appear throughout modern physics. In polygonal knot
theory, a new twist on the
              classical study of knots, a different
type of singular spaces is studied. This
              new theory is modeled by
sticks joined end to end by universally flexible
              joints (rubber
tubing perhaps) to form a closed loop. The PI has produced
              the
first examples of configurations which are stuck (cannot be
unraveled),
              but only because they are made of sticks.  If the
same configurations were
              made of string they could be unraveled.
Knot theory of strings has been
              applied to the study of protein
and DNA molecules.  For a small number of
              atoms each bond can be
represented by a stick in the model discussed here,
              This is a
richer and more appropriate model for small molecules than
              the
string which has been used in the past.
