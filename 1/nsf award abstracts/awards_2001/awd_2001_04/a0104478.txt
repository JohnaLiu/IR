Abstract    :
              The Exploratorium will create the "Outdoor Exploratorium," a 10,000-square-foot,
              open-air exhibit environment comprising 20 to 25 original installations.  Each
              exhibit will allow visitors to interact directly with a variety of elements,
              that is water, wind, sound, light, and living things, as they exist in the
              natural world.  One of the key components of this project will be the use of
              "Noticing Tours."  Led by staff scientists, artists, educators, exhibit
              developers, and other "expert noticers," the tours will initiate a dialogue
              with the visitors as a starting point for exhibit development.  To augment
              visitor learning and unify the museum's entire collection, exhibit text will
              relate the "Outdoor Exploratorium" experiences to exhibits.  The project will
              culminate in a workbook for the field and two workshops for museum
              professionals.  The Exploratorium Teacher Institute staff will develop two-week
              institutes that make extensive use of the "Outdoor Exploratorium."  Classroom
              activities and inquiry-based learning experiences will be developed based on
              the new exhibits.
