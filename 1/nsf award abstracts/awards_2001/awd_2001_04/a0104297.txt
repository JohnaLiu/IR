Abstract    :
              Although streams are networks of aquatic habitat that are distributed across a
              terrestrial landscapes; little is known about how the patterns of these
              networks affect the distributions of organisms that live within them.  The
              objective of this research is to examine how stoneflies, a group of insects
              that develop as larvae in streams and live in the forest as adults, disperse
              among streams, and how the patterns of streams affect the distribution of
              stoneflies in the White Mountain National Forest of New Hampshire.  Using
              stable isotopes, adult stoneflies will be tracked in the forest to measure
              flight distances.  A model will be developed to predict how individual insect
              and habitat characteristics affect flight patterns.  Historic dispersal
              patterns will be estimated indirectly by assessing relatedness of individuals
              using molecular genetics. This research will provide a greater understanding of
              how aquatic insect populations are integrated among streams, and will be useful
              for predicting how disturbances affect populations distributed across connected
              habitats.
