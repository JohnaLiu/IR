This Americas Program award will provide support for
              cooperative research between Dr. Gaston Gutierrez of Fermi National Accelerator
              Laboratory and Dr. Marcos A. Reyes Santos of the Universidad Michoacana in
              Morelia, Mexico, on a project entitled "Search for Glueballs in High Energy
              Central Reactions."
A fundamental objective of all particle physics research
              is to understand the interactions of the basic forms of matter and their
              structure.  Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is currently the leading theory
              governing the structure and interactions of particles subject to the nuclear
              force.  A unique feature of QCD is that the force carrier, called gluons, may
              form bound states known as glueballs.  At present, there is little experimental
              evidence about such states.  This proposal will allow the collaborators to
              analyze existing Fermilab data (Experiment 690), which was collected using an
              800 GeV proton beam on a liquid hydrogen target.  The results of this analysis
              will serve to confirm the existence of glueballs in various reactions and
              increase our understanding of elementary particle physics.
