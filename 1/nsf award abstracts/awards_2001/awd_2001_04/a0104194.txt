Abstract    :
              The Kentucky Science and Technology Council, Inc., through its Appalachian Rural
              Systemic Initiative Leadership, will host a conference on research topics
              needed in rural education, particularly in the disadvantaged Appalachian
              region. The conference will bring together researchers, practitioners,
              community leaders, parents, and others interested in rural education, to
              formulate a research agenda, most likely conducted through a partnership with
              two regional research universities.
