Abstract    :
              Landscapes, both natural and human-altered, are a mosaic of habitat types. The
              success of an individual in finding high quality habitat within this mosaic
              will affect both its survival and the dynamics of whole populations. This
              investigation examines the interaction between individual behavior and
              population dynamics across a landscape by studying the eastern painted turtle.
              The researchers ask how pond quality, size, and location and the types of
              intervening habitat influence the movement of turtles between ponds. Measuring
              growth rates and reproductive output will assess the impact of movement on
              individuals.  The effects of these movements on population processes (birth,
              death, immigration, and emigration rates) for each pond and across the
              landscape will then be determined. 

One of the consequences of current land
              use practices is an increase in the fragmentation of habitat. Habitat areas
              suitable for supporting wildlife are becoming smaller and more distant from
              each other. Information on how species react to and cope with small, isolated
              habitats embedded in unfavorable landscapes is needed in order to conduct
              proper management. This research is one of the most detailed examinations into
              individual behavior at the landscape level yet to be conducted. It will provide
              concrete evidence for the importance of integrating behavior and population
              dynamics.
