Abdominal pigmentation pattern varies widely in the genus
              Drosophila.
In particular, the South American species D. polymorpha exhibits a
              range
of abdominal pigmentation patterns, with light, intermediate, and
              dark
morphs.  The frequency of these morphs varies with time and
              space,
indicating that this trait is under natural selection and thus
              important
in the ecology of the species.  The proposed research aims to
              understand
this pigmentation pattern polymorphism from both developmental
              and
population genetic perspectives by: 1) examining the
              developmental
processes leading to pigmentation differences within the
              species; 2)
correlating pigmentation differences with variation at candidate
              gene
loci; and 3) examining the microevolutionary forces affecting
              current
geographic distributions of the trait by determining the
              spatial
distribution of genetic variation in natural Brazilian
              populations.
Only a few similar studies have investigated the general question
              of
morphological evolution at such a microevolutionary level, and only
              a
subset of these have addressed the evolutionary forces shaping the fate
of
              a variable trait.   Finally, this proposal is unique in that it is
              a
multidisciplinary approach, uniting investigators and integrating
methods
              from both developmental biology and population genetics in both the United
              States and Brazil.
