This award provides partial
              support for active research
mathematicians with limited means of support to
              attend and
participate in the Southern California Geometric Analysis
Seminar
              to be held in the winter quarter of 2002, 2003, and
2004.  The seminar will be
              held at the University of
California, Irvine in 2002, the University of
              California,
San-Diego in 2003, and the University of California, Irvine
in
              2004. The potential speakers will be M. Gromov
(IHES/Courant), K.  Grove
              (Maryland), T. Mrowka (MIT), P.
Sarnak (Princeton), E.  Witten (Princeton) and
              S.T. Yau
(Harvard) for the winter 2002.  The Seminar will typically
be held
              over a weekend with 3 main (one-hour) lectures on
Saturday and another 3 main
              lectures on Sunday.  The
schedule will be arranged so that there will be ample
              time
for the participants to interact with the speakers and
              other
participants.  A social event will also be arranged for
Saturday
              evening to promote further interaction.
