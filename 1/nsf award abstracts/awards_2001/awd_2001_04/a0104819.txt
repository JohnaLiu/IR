Abstract    :
              Despite a widespread belief that phosphorus (P) availability poses a strong
              constraint on ecosystem dynamics in tropical forests, direct tests of this
              belief are rare. Furthermore, most studies that have addressed this issue have
              focused on P limitation to the plant community; virtually none have addressed
              the possibility that the microbial community is P limited. Mr. Cleveland's
              dissertation research to date suggests that decomposition of carbon in a
              lowland tropical rainforest in southwestern Costa Rica is P limited, although
              the extent of this limitation is still unknown. Early findings have revealed
              that in spite of the apparent P limitation to microbial processes at this site,
              the production and activity of phosphatases, enzymes responsible for the
              mineralization of organic P, are relatively low. This Doctoral Dissertation
              Improvement Grant will support experiments that address the following two basic
              questions: 1. Does phosphorus availability limit the decomposition of native
              carbon in moist tropical forests? and 2. At a site where the mineralization of
              organic P should be important in offsetting deficiencies in available inorganic
              P, is phosphatase activity directly limited by the availability of another
              element?
