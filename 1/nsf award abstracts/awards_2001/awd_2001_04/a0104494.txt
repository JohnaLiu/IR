Abstract    :
              The advent of the exploding Internet and the terra-bytes of
heterogeneous data
              in it have made more acute the topic of searching
such large digital
              databases. The challenges involved go beyond
questions in information
              retrieval. One may envision seeking images in
films, seeking words in voice
              data, and seeking phrases in compressed
files and in files of various
              types.
These challenges have boosted the appearance of myriad
              start-up
companies and ad-hoc methods for the various tasks.
The PI's
              approach has been a basic bottom-up long-term study of the
theory of
              searching. They have a large center of pattern matching
research that has
              pursued and continues to pursue understanding of the
theoretical underpinnings
              of generalized searching, coupled with
applications of their various
              ideas.

the current research will continue the investigation of issues
              in
generalized searching. In particular:
        1. Approximate indexing with
              a small number of errors.
        2. In-place compressed search.
        3.
              ``Reusable'' dynamic programming code.
        4. Parameterized matching with
              ``don't care''s.
Research on the theory of image processing will also
              be
continued. The particular areas of concentration are: 
	1. The effect of
              digitization.
	2. Real multi-dimensional scaling.
	3. Efficient search of
              rotated images.
The investigators' research group has started a program of
              selective
implementation of advanced pattern matching ideas, some in
              conjunction
with research groups from other application areas. There are plans
              to
implement text fingerprinting ideas and test their applicability in
IR. In
              addition a project is planned that incorporates many of the
ideas on searching
              compressed and heterogeneous files by constructing
an automatic scientific
              home-page generator and maintainer (guaranteed
to be an instant hit with all
              professors of Computer Science!).
