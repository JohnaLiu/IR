Dr. Ruan proposes to study the
              Lagrangian fibration structure of 
Calabi-Yau manifolds and of more general
              Kaehler manifolds, 
and their applications in mirror symmetry 
and other
              Kahler geometry problems as well. The objective of the proposed research 
is
              to further inderstand the Lagrangian torus fibration structures for
              more
general Calabi-Yau manifolds, exploring the interplay of
              sympletic
geometry and complex geometry in Kaehler manifolds, as indicated
              
by Kontsevich's categorical mirror symmetry program. 

Mirror symmetry has
              its origin in string theory and
says that we have two theories, which appear
              to be completely distinct, 
describing the same physics. If we have two
              different  models of the same universe, 
one can expect that one of the models
              can fill in the gaps in understanding 
the other model. This project is 
              towards understanding this symmetry principle.
Results from this proposal
              should be of interest to mathematicians from
various disciplines as well as
              physicists in string theory.
