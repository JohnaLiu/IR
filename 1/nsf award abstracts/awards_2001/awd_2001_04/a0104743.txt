Abstract    :
              "Community Science Workshops:  Beginning a National Movement" is an extension of
              a successful, NSF-funded project that created a network of community science
              centers in California.  The San Francisco State University will now take this
              successful venture to a national level by working with the American Association
              for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and Quality Education for Minorities
              (QEM) to establish a new Community Science Workshop (CSW) 8-10 in underserved
              communities over the next four years.  Once sites are selected, CSW directors
              participate in an intensive two-week training program.  This is followed by
              visits by site mentors, and ongoing support through the WWW and other media,
              which contributes to the establishment and eventual sustainability of the
              centers.  Each site partners with larger, established museums and science
              centers locally to gain much needed assistance with exhibits and education
              programs.  Community Science Workshops contain permanent exhibit space, a
              workshop area for student projects and classroom/storage space.  They serve a
              variety of audiences through after school, family, school and summer science
              programs.  Potential locations include Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan,
              Montana, Nebraska, New York, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and the District of
              Columbia.
