Abstract    :
              This effort is designed to investigate whether galactic cosmic ray (GCR)
              variations that result from variations in solar activity can affect low cloud
              properties, and if so, to elucidate the physical mechanism and the magnitude of
              such effects.  Distinct correlations between GCR intensity and average global
              coverage of low-level clouds have recently been reported.  The P.I. will
              utilize a basic aerosol microphysics model constrained by data from recent
              field programs such as the Aerosol Characterization Experiments (ACE), and the
              TRACE-P (Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific) to test several
              hypotheses for explaining the link between GCR and cloud condensation nuclei
              (CCN) in the atmosphere.  The P.I. will investigate classical binary and
              ternary nucleation theories as well as his own ion-mediated nucleation (IMN)
              hypothesis.
