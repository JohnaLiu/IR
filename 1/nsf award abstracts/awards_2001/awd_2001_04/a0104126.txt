The focus of the proposed research is the study of knots
              and
3-dimensional spaces.  We will examine questions about surgery on
knots,
              knotting of graphs in 3-space dimensional spaces, and
Heegaard decompositions
              of 3-manifolds.  We describe three
specific goals and their connections to
              some of the basic
questions in the field.  The first goal is to develop the
              tools
and techniques of multi-parameter thin position and sweep-outs so
that
              they can be used to tackle some of the long-standing
problems in knot theory
              and 3-manifold theory.  A second is to
extend work of the proposer and M.
              Scharlemann on unknotted
planar graphs in the 3-sphere to a more general
              setting.
Finally, we aim to obtain a clearer understanding of
              general
questions about 3-manifolds by obtaining a deeper understanding
of
              3-manifolds of Heegaard genus two.  We will examine specific
questions about
              tunnel number one knots, special cases of larger
questions about what genus
              two manifolds can be obtained by
surgery on a knot in the 3-sphere, which of
              these manifolds
contain immersed surfaces with injective fundamental groups,
              and
how information from the Heegaard diagrams of these manifolds
translates
              into geometric and algebraic information about the
manifold itself.

We live
              in what is apparently a universe with three spatial
dimensions.  Exploring the
              possible forms that our universe might
have is not only a deep problem for
              physicists but also for
mathematicians.  Different mathematical possibilities
              lead to
very different expected physical properties.  As an example, we
do do
              not know if, were we able to program a very fast rocket to
go "straight" into
              space, it would eventually return to its
starting point, like a ship on the
              surface of the earth, or if it
would continue to travel away from us forever. 
              There are an
infinite number of possibilities for the shape of the
              universe.
This project proposes to explore some of them using the
techniques
              of low-dimensional topology and knot theory.
