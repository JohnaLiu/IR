Abstract    :
              "Teens Exploring and Explaining Nature and Science" (TEENS) is a year-long,
              multi-component program  serving Chicago public school students from 7th to
              12th grade through three contiguous programs:  
(1) SMART Squad; (2) Science
              Explorers; and (3) Science Guides which focus on science education and
              job-skills training.  The purpose of the project is to raise students'
              expectations for academic achievement, to enhance their scientific knowledge,
              and to increase their academic skills, occupational expectations, aspirations
              and self-esteem.
