Abstract    :
              This project will continue an ongoing measurement program at Mauna Loa
              Observatory (MLO) to collect and analyze aerosol filter samples for non-seasalt
              sulfate (NSS), nitrate, sodium, ammonium, and nitric acid.  The decade-long
              free tropospheric observations of aerosol concentrations at MLO provide a basis
              for comparison with chemical transport models from the Asia-Pacific region and
              for use in global climate models.
