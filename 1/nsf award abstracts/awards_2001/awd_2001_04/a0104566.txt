Abstract    :
              
Orchids comprise one of the largest plant families with approximately 20,000
              described species.  They represent an extremely diverse group of organisms with
              a worldwide distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica.  The
              large tribe Vandeae makes up 10% of the entire family.  It possesses several
              very specialized members that have been evolutionarily reduced to a leafless
              and often almost stemless state.  These plants depend entirely on their green
              roots for food manufacture.  The primary focus of this study is to develop a
              phylogenetic hypothesis for these leafless Vandeae using molecular evidence
              from DNA as well as evidence from macro- and microscopic root
              structure.

With the recent spate of molecular data, evolutionary
              relationships of plant groups are being reestablished and recircumscribed. 
              Surprisingly, Vandeae, a significant group within the orchid family, has been
              essentially untouched by molecular taxonomists.  This study will provide an
              additional set of characters, which can be used to derive hypotheses of
              evolutionary relationships.  More importantly, questions concerning the
              evolution of one of the most extreme modes of epiphytism will be answered.
