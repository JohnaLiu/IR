This project includes several different
              directions of 
research.  Carlsson will study a homotopy theoretic model 
he
              has constructed for the algebraic K-theory spectrum of 
a field, which is
              built out of the representation theory of 
the absolute Galois group of the
              field.  He will try to prove 
that the model is indeed equivalent to the
              K-theory of the 
field, as well as to work out the consequences of this result
              
for the Quillen-Lichtenbaum conjectures and the relationship 
between this
              result and the Bloch-Kato conjecture. He will 
also investigate potential
              applications of algebraic topology 
in high dimensional data analysis.  He
              expects to improve 
software which he and V. De Silva have developed for
              homology computation, with the goal of identifying features such as 
singular
              points as well as global topology for data sets of 
dimension greater than
              three. He also plans to study homotopy 
theoretic issues which arise in
              computational questions, 
relating to sampling subcomplexes from large
              simplicial 
complexes.  Kiem plans to compute intersection numbers for
              
singular moduli spaces of curves.  This is an important 
problem since the
              intersection numbers in this case are 
related to well-known geometric
              invariants, such as the 
Casson invariant.

One of the great themes in
              mathematics over the last two 
centuries is the strong relationship between
              arithmetic 
and geometry.  The study of this theme was initiated by  
Abel
              and Galois in the early 19th century, and in this 
century its further
              development has resulted in our 
obtaining very precise information concerning
              sets of 
integer or rational solutions to systems of equations.  
The goal of
              this project is to explore another manifestation 
of this theme, in the form
              of the so-called algebraic 
K-theory of fields.  Algebraic K-theory is a
              geometric 
construction attached to arithmetic objects, called fields.
              
Fields are arithmetic objects in which one can add, 
multiply, and divide. 
              Algebraic K-theory attaches 
geometric objects to these fields, and in such a
              way 
that already well understood invariants of fields can 
be extracted
              easily.  Algebraic K-theory also contains 
many less well understood
              invariants as well, and the 
goal of understanding these invariants has been
              one 
toward which topologists have been striving since the 
early 1970's,
              when Quillen defined higher algebraic 
K-theory.  Two important conjectures
              have been 
formulated concerning algebraic K-theory, the 
Quillen-Lichtenbaum
              and Bloch-Kato conjectures.  
They would relate the algebraic K-theory of a
              field 
to properties of its "absolute Galois groups", an 
object which
              incorporates all possible symmetries of 
sets of solutions of sets of
              equations over the field 
in question.  This project aims to understand very
              
clearly how algebraic K-theory is built out of 
information of this large
              group of symmetries,  
and to use this understanding to approach the 
two
              central conjectures mentioned above.
