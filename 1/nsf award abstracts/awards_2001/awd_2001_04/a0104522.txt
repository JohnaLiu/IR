Abstract    :
              Priority effects - influences of species already present in a community on the
              successful colonization by later arriving species - are important during the
              formation of ecological communities (community assembly).  Because of
              increasing habitat fragmentation, it is important to understand whether the
              influence of priority effects can be generalized across locations.  The
              proposed research examines priority effects in a model system: insect and
              spider communities inhabiting creosote bush in Arizona.  Experiments will be
              conducted in two habitat types (i.e., desert remnants and outlying desert
              areas) that previous research found to differ in degree of fragmentation,
              diversity, recovery following disturbance, and response to priority effects. 
              Research will investigate the influence of two predatory pioneer colonists on
              community recovery and determine how long priority effects are detectable in
              community assembly.  This approach to community ecology will illustrate the
              importance of initial conditions during species assembly that will be useful to
              restoration ecologists working in fragmented habitats.
