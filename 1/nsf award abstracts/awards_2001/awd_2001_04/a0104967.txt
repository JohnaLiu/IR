Males wild turkeys form stable coalitions during
              the breeding season that cooperatively court females. This cooperative behavior
              is puzzling because of the intense competition among males for females.  The
              project will determine genetic relatedness among coalitions of male turkeys and
              provide a comprehensive view of the benefits keeping subordinate males in
              groups. The theoretical framework used will be reproductive skew theory, a
              rapidly evolving field that seeks to explain how reproduction is partitioned
              within social groups. Low status males may profit through direct reproduction,
              through indirect reproduction by helping a related group member, or by
              inheriting the dominant position at some time in the future.  Reproductive skew
              models provide quantitative predictions to determine what combination of these
              three benefits are important for the formation and maintenance of male
              coalitions.  These predictions will be tested by combining behavioral and
              genetic data on a free-ranging wild turkey population in central coastal
              California.
