This project concerns modeling of
              heat propagation in materials at low temperatures (including superconducting
              regions) which are characterized by fast processes whose properties cannot
              be
explained simply through the use of Fourier's law.  The models under study
              are applicable to a wide class of materials for which heat waves, or "second
              sound," can be detected, and they accommodate important hyperbolic/parabolic
              phase transitions between two temperature regions, which are not included in
              other general theories.  Under study are qualitative properties of the
              long-time behavior of both smooth solutions and solutions having shocks. 
              Free-boundary problems modeling phase transitions are also
              studied.

Conventional models of heat conduction involve infinite speed of
              propagation.  The approximations that lead to this counterintuitive situation
              work well in most practical settings.  Experimental studies of heat propagation
              in systems at very low temperatures, however, show the need for  a theory with
              finite speed of propagation.  This research project concerns development of
              such a theory of heat propagation in crystalline materials at low temperatures
              and mathematical analysis of the resultant partial differential equations.  The
              project, carried out with the participation of undergraduate students, will
              lead to an efficient, generally applicable theory of heat propagation in
              solids, with possible eventual application to high-temperature superconducting
              materials and fast process laser heating.
