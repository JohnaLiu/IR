Abstract    :
              The "Mission Discovery" project targeting middle school youth is a collaborative
              endeavor between the Carnegie Science Center (CSC) and the Hill House
              Association.  This year-round project will work with inner-city children from
              communities in southwestern Pennsylvania.  Thirty middle school students will
              experience standards-based, creative programs and activities.  Physical
              Science, Life Science and Earth & Space Science will be the content focus of
              the project.  CSC provides the mathematics and science expertise while the Hill
              House Association (serving six predominately low-income African American
              communities) provides the community, recruitment and staffing expertise.
