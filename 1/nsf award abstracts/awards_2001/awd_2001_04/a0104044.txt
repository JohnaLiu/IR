In this proposal the research will study the
              geometry, 
asymptotic behavior, conformal structure and topology 
of properly
              embedded minimal surfaces in R3 .  
One of the main goals of the proposal is
              to classify 
all properly embedded minimal surfaces of genus zero 
and to
              describe the asymptotic geometry of all finite genus examples. 
Related
              theoretical techniques concerning compactness, 
regularity and convergence of
              minimal surfaces of 
locally bounded genus will be investigated as well. 
              
One hoped for application of this research is 
to classify all smooth finite
              group actions on S3 .  
Finally the research proposes to prove that Bryant
              surfaces 
in hyperbolic three-space are unknotted.

Classical minimal
              surface theory has its roots in 18th and 19th century mathematics
and gives
              one of the first important examples in what is called the 
calculus of
              variations, first described by Euler.  
Physically minimal surfaces can be
              modeled locally as soap films on wires 
or by surfaces of least-area relative
              to local boundaries.  
These surfaces play an important role as a tool in the
              study of
three-dimensional topology and Riemannian geometry.  
The research
              in this proposal concerns global properties 
of these surfaces and possible
              applications 
to basic research in three-dimensional topology and geometry.
