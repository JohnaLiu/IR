Abstract    :
              This is a proposal for some of the critical R&D needed to bring the muon storage
              ring/neutrino source to the point where it can be evaluated as a potential
              physics project for the field.  In addition, it may pave the way for a future
              muon storage ring to explore physics at an energy scale beyond what is foreseen
              for the coming decade.

This is of great interest as it can lead to advances
              in neutrino physics and possibly eventually to a new method to make a lepton
              collider. More specifically, this project can have significant impact on the
              enabling of well characterized, narrow band, variable energy beams of neutrinos
              for the determination of neutrino mass and mixing parameters and possibly for
              seeing CP violation in the neutrino sector. Students will be given diverse
              opportunities to work on unique problems.
