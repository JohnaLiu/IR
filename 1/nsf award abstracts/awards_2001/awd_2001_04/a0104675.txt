This U.S. Mexico award will support Drs. Mark Levi, Howard
              Weiss, and Yakov Pesin in a research collaboration with Valentine Afraimovich
              of the Mathematics Department of the Unversidad Autonoma de San Luis de Potosi.
               The investigators plan to study: 1) Coupled map lattices corresponding to
              partial differential equations from physics and biology, in particular, the
              FitzHugh-Nagumo equation (which is of great interest in neurobiology).  The
              collaborators intend to describe the ergodic properties of its local map and
              construct SRB measures for the attractor of this map. 2) The transition from
              coupled map lattices to partial differential equations via traveling waves,
              which will build a foundation for numerical modeling of some partial
              differential equations of evolution type. 3) The Dynamics of chains of coupled
              oscillators, in particular, those associated with the Sine-Gordon
              equation.

A coupled map lattice is a discrete time dynamical system whose
              phase space is of a particular form, and for which the overall system exhibits
              translational symmetry.
Coupled map lattices have recently gained wide
              popularity as models of spatio-temporal chaos and coherent structures. There is
              currently great interest in using coupled map lattices to model turbulence,
              nerve cells, phase transitions in statistical physics, and crystals. They also
              arise naturally from the discrete version of evolution partial differential
              equations.
