This one-year award will support a dissertation
              enhancement project of Greg Lee, a student in the Biorobotics Lab of the
              Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Washington.  He will
              work with Prof. Paolo Dario at the ARTS/MITEC Laboratory at the Scuola
              Superiore Santa Anna, in Pisa, Italy. The objective of Mr. Lee's research is to
              incorporate MEMS techniques into his research on low power haptics.  Mr. Lee
              will benefit from studying biorobotic MEMS technology being developed at the
              ARTS/MITEC laboratory, which is unique in its integration of MEMS with
              biorobotics. interface.  While at ARTS/MITEC, Mr. Lee will offer seminars in
              real-time embedded Windows CE networked control systems.
