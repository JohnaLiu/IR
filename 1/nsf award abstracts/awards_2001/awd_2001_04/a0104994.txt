Abstract    :
              Soil aggregates, groups of soil particles bound together into a larger
              structural unit, may be important regulators of carbon and nitrogen cycling in
              soil.  Aggregates physically protect organic matter from microbial oxidation
              and provide microsite habitats that may favor greenhouse gas production.
              Aggregate structure is typically lost following soil disturbances such as
              tillage, and the recovery of aggregate structure could help mitigate
              environmental problems related to carbon and nitrogen cycling.  Accelerated
              carbon and nitrogen transformations in disturbed ecosystems contribute to a
              number of environmental problems, including greenhouse gas accumulation,
              groundwater contamination, and soil erosion.  

This research will examine
              soil aggregation and its effects on carbon and nitrogen cycling in ten
              ecosystems on the same soil series along a disturbance gradient.  The systems
              range from intensively managed, row crop agriculture to late successional
              forests.  The research will test hypotheses about the recovery and breakdown of
              aggregates on soil carbon storage, trace gas fluxes, and microbial population
              structure.
