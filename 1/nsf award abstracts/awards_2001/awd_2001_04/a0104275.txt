This
              project develops a new area of noncommutative algebraic
topology and its
              applications to low-dimensional topology. The
success of algebraic topology in
              knot theory, for example, has,
until recently centered around abelian
              invariants, that is to
say, invariants associated to the universal abelian
              covering
space of the knot or link exterior. These invariants are
              the
Alexander module, which is the first homology of this cover as a
module
              over a commutative Laurent polynomial ring, and the
Blanchfield pairing. These
              determine the S-equivalence class of
the knot as well as various other
              invariants. From the
perspective of the knot group G, the Alexander module is
              simply
G'/G".  Hence any behavior associated to G" will be invisible to
these
              abelian invariants. We remedy this deficiency by studying
the quotients of
              successive terms of the higher derived series,
or, put another way, study
              modules associated to more general
solvable covering spaces. These are modules
              over noncommutative
rings and thus are difficult to work with. We use
              techniques from
noncommutative algebra and C* algebras to define invariants.
              We
find , for each integer n, an entire theory which parallels the
Alexander
              module and Blanchfield form and signatures. There are
applications to
              estimating genus, detecting fibered knots and
3-manifolds, new invariants of
              concordance and representations of
mapping class groups.

The advent of
              quantum mechanics led scientists to many
paradoxical, but now accepted, facts
              about our universe. In
particular, there came the realization that
              "commutative
mathematics" was inadequate to describe our physical
world.
              Recall that 2 times 3 equals 3 times 2 is the commutative
law of
              multiplication of numbers. Quantum mechanics showed that
physical quantities
              are not mere numbers but more like arrays or
matrices of numbers. Since
              multiplication of matrices is not
commutative, this explains and models
              noncommutative phenomena at
the most fundamental levels of the physical world.
              This project
studies the shape of 3 and 4-dimensional spaces by using
              new
noncommutative mathematics arising from algebra.
