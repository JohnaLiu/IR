Abstract    :
              
We propose various directions for studying embedded minimal surfaces
in
              three-manifolds.  This includes the study of the convergence of such
surfaces,
               how they degenerate and whether or not their Morse index is
bounded. There
              are many possible applications of results along these lines
including to the
              spherical space-form problem, the topology of
three-manifolds with positive
              scalar curvature etc.  In addition, these results should
yield new insight
              into minimal surfaces in Euclidean space.


This project focuses on minimal
              surfaces in three-dimensional
manifolds.  Minimal surfaces are critical points
              for area (e.g.,
soap films are least area surfaces) and arise naturally in
              many
problems in mathematics and in the other sciences.   Many of
              the
classical results in this area are on least area surfaces.  In
              contrast,
our main interest is in high index (i.e., highly unstable) embedded
              minimal
surfaces with bounded topology - a well-known example is given by
the
              standard helicoid.  Roughly speaking, the point of some of our theorems
is
              that the behavior of the helicoid is typical.
