'Soft'
              segmentation is a recent innovation in image processing which attempts to
              preserve the maximum amount of information possible in an image while
              classifying various image elements.  Soft segmentation produces flexible (e.g.,
              fuzzy or probabilistic) labels for individual pixels in an image as opposed to
              forcing a decision about each pixel.  Soft segmentation is an effective method
              for noisy images, such as intra-operative fluoroscopic x-ray images, where
              preservation of information is critical.  In recent years, a variety of
              promising voxel-property or intensity-based matching algorithms have been
              developed for three-dimensional (3D) medical image registration, but these
              algorithms are inadequate in the presence of significant noise.  Spine images
              contain rigid elements (vertebrae) within a deformable structure (spine). 
              Registration is performed on a single vertebra, therefore, spine images contain
              both structured and unstructured noise.  Research is proposed to apply soft
              labels to the segmentation of two-dimensional (2D) images of the spine for
              2D/3D image registration.  The postdoctoral associate will assist in 1)
              adapting an existing fiducial-based clinical spinal navigation system to use
              image-based fine registration using pre-segmented images, 2) developing a
              semi-automated segmentation of fluoroscopic images growing a bounding-box
              around the region of interest, 3) developing both fuzzy and probabilistic
              'soft' labels for segmenting the fluoroscopic images, and 4) the convolution of
              soft labels into gradient and mutual information-based intensity-based matching
              algorithms.
