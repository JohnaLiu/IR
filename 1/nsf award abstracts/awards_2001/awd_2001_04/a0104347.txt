Dr. Winn is awarded an NSF Astronomy
              and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research,
              education, and public outreach at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
              Astrophysics.  His research program will apply the phenomenon of gravitational
              lensing and the techniques of radio and optical interferometry to problems in
              cosmology and galactic structure.   Using gravitationally lensed quasars, he
              will measure the current expansion rate of the Universe, and will test whether
              this expansion rate is accelerating.  In a third project, he will attempt to
              find and study central black holes in distant galaxies.  He also plans to
              contribute to the technical development of optical interferometry and its
              application to study gravitational lensing by compact dark objects in our
              Galaxy.  His educational and public outreach program includes teaching several
              undergraduate courses and continuing to write articles about science and
              science policy for the public.
