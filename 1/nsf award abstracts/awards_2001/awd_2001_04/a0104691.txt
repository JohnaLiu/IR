Abstract    :
              The Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM) will develop "Cyborgs:  A Natural History
              of Machines and Humans."  The Project will result in a national traveling
              exhibit, a web site, and a complement of related educational programs focused
              on the boundaries between humans and their machines and on recent scientific
              efforts to understand the human body and mind.  The 6,000-square-foot exhibit
              will open at the SMM before traveling to the six large museums in the Science
              Museum Exhibit Collaborative (SMEC), and then will be available for lease by
              other museums.
