Spectral Analysis of Gapped or Missing Data

This research focuses on
              the spectral analysis of gapped or incomplete data sequences. The gapped or
              missing data problem usually arises when contiguous data measurements for a
              long time are hard to obtain or the measurements during some intervals are not
              useful due to strong interference or jamming and must be discarded. Spectral
              analysis of gapped or incomplete data sequences holds promise to advance many
              fields including astronomy, communications, medical imaging, radar, and
              underwater acoustics.


This research involves the development and
              application of efficient and robust spectral analysis algorithms for incomplete
              data sequences. The goals of this research are to devise and evaluate
              statistically sound and mathematically solid spectral analysis methods for
              various applications that involve the spectral analysis of gapped or incomplete
              data sequences, to gain both practical and theoretical insights into the
              algorithm properties including accuracy, resolution, convergence, and
              computational complexity, and to understand the impacts of large gaps or large
              numbers of missing data samples on the algorithm design. It is anticipated that
              the results of this study will significantly impact the advances of many
              practical applications.
