It is proposed to study the shock wave theory for conservation
              laws and 
the Boltzmann equation in the kinetic theory. Shock waves occurs in
              many 
natural phenomena, such as supersonic flight, sonar wind, earthquakes
              and 
hurricanes. There is now a satisfactory mathematical theory for the
              
inviscid plane motion. It is planned to study the multi-dimensional gas
              
motion as well as the dissipation effects. The Boltzmann equation models
              
the gas motion on the microscopic level. This is necessary for important
              
physical phenomena such as the thermal effects of the boundary on the gas
              
motion. The nonlinear waves and the boundary effects for the Boltzmann
              
equation will be studied.

The Euler equations and Navier-Stokes equations
              for the gas dynamics are 
considered. The project will include the study of
              the nonlinear stability of 
shock waves for these and more general systems of
              hyperbolic-parabolic 
conservation laws. The approach combines the pointwise
              estimates and the 
energy estimates and is based on the new understanding of
              the structure of 
the Green's function for the equations linearized about the
              shock. For the 
Boltzmann equation, the positivity of Boltzmann shocks has
              been shown 
and the boundary effects such as the thermal creep are being
              studied. 
These are based on the new macro-micro decomposition of the
              Boltzmann 
equation and time-asymptotic analysis.
