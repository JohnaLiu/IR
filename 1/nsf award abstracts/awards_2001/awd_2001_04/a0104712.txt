Abstract    :
              Education Development Center (EDC) is developing and implementing a three-year
              project to promote the informal learning of key basic mathematical concepts and
              skills among undereducated adults throughout the country.  The effort will be
              part of EDC's Adult Literacy Media Alliance (ALMA).  The principal components
              of the project will be:

Ten new, half-hour episodes of the television
              series, TV411, which is currently carried by approximately 100 public
              television stations.  The new programs will shift the emphasis of the series
              from reading literacy to mathematics skills.  In addition to covering a broad
              array of mathematical concepts, procedures and vocabulary, the programs will
              have an explicit focus on problem-solving strategies and attitudes about
              mathematics.

A multi-level national outreach and marketing campaign to
              attract viewers and users to the materials and to increase carriage of the
              series.  An in-depth implementation effort will be conducted with outreach
              partners is six large metropolitan areas.  EDC will adapt the outreach,
              marketing and promotion aspects of this focused effort so that it can be used
              by all television stations that commit to carry the series.  

Formative and
              summative evaluation to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the materials
              and to inform the understanding of the impact on viewers and users of these
              types of materials.
