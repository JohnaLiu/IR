This award provides partial support for active
              research 
mathematicians with limited means of support to attend 
and
              participate in the Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth 
Annual Workshops in
              Geometric Topology to be held in the 
summers of 2001, 2002, and 2003.  The
              workshops will be hosted
by Oregon State University in the 2001, Calvin
              College in 2002, 
and Brigham Young University in 2003. The 2001 Workship will
              
feature Princial Speaker Abigail Thompson of the University of California,
              Davis who will deliver three one hour lectures.  
Similarly, the 2002 and 2003
              Workshops will also be centered around prominent principal speakers.  Further
              information is available at:
