Abstract    :
              The ability to identify, recognize and manipulate patterns is fundamental to
              knowing the world.  Brooklyn Children's Museum (BCM) is developing "Pattern
              Place," a new collections-based traveling exhibition, to introduce children
              ages 7 to 10 to the structure, meaning and importance of patterns.  The
              exhibition will incorporate an array of objects from BCM's collections and
              open-ended, hands-on inquiry skills.  The 1,200-square-foot trilingual
              exhibition will open at BCM in 2002 and then travel to eight other museums in
              the U.S. and Canada.  A range of family programming, a Web site and a portable
              museum kit will provide further dissemination and support educators in
              incorporating object-based inquiry into the classroom curriculum.
