The project consists of developing the homotopy
              theory 
of classifying spaces of compact Lie groups (including 
finite
              groups) and their generalizations. The goal of 
this is to solve central
              problems in homotopy theory involving classifying spaces, as well as to
              discover new relations
to problems in group theory and representation theory.
              
A further goal is to produce results in related fields 
such as in the
              theory of group actions, equivariant 
cohomology, and group cohomology. The
              project centers
around developing the homotopy theoretic group theory 
of the
              classifying space BG, or rather of its p-completion. 
This involves examining
              the induction theory, p-local theory, representation theory as well as the more
              general actions 
of these objects. The methods used come from modern unstable
              
homotopy theory, developed since the solution of the 
Sullivan conjecture,
              combined with ideas and techniques 
from modern group theory.

Forming the
              classifying space BG of a group of 
symmetries G is a way of geometrically or
              topologically 
encoding the "symmetries" present in G. Geometric spaces 
of
              this form and generalizations thereof are ubiquitous 
in topology, and hence
              form an important class of 
spaces to study.  Furthermore, the less rigid
              structure 
of the classifying space BG, compared to that of
the group G,
              makes certain techniques available in 
the study of the former which were not
              available when 
dealing with the later directly. Hence, studying the
              group
theory of BG provides an interesting and useful way of 
studying the
              original group G.
