This award supports a three-year collaborative research
              project between Professor Mitsunori Denda of Rutgers University and Professor
              Julio Florez-Lopez of the University on the Andes in Venezuela.  The project
              will focus on the assessment of damage to reinforced concrete structures
              subject to strong loading.  The research team will carry out analytical,
              numerical and experimental studies to compare the fracture mechanics and lumped
              damage mechanics approaches of assessing cracking in reinforced concrete
              structures.
 
The vulnerability of concrete structures to strong loading,
              such as that caused by earthquakes, results in significant loss of life and
              property damage.  Potential new approaches to assessing the cracking behavior
              of reinforced concrete could have far-reaching implications for building safer
              structures and mitigating against damages from earthquakes.  This collaboration
              brings together the efforts of international laboratories with complementary
              expertise and research facilities.  The project will directly involve U.S.
              undergraduate and graduate students in the international collaboration.
