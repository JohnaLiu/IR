This six-month award will provide support for US researchers
              to attend a workshop on disordered systems in Andalo, Italy, March 12 - 15,
              2000.  Joseph Feldman, Center for Computational Materials Science, Naval
              Research Laboratory is the US organizer; Gabriele Viliani, Department of
              Physics, Trento University, Italy is the European co-organizer.  Although this
              is the eighth workshop of its type, it is the first at which US researchers
              will be a strong presence.  The workshop will focus on an understanding of the
              glass transition and of the high-frequency dynamics in glasses.  The purpose of
              US attendance is to develop ongoing collaboration between US and European
              researchers in the field of disordered systems.
