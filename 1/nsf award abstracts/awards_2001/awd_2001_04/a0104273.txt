Abstract    :
              With this award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the
              work of Dr. John D. Roberts at the California Institute of Technology in
              Pasadena, California.   The work will build on earlier work of the PI on
              substituent effects on conformational equilibria of 1,2-disubstituted ethanes. 
               These equilibria will be studied by NMR using proton-proton vicinal coupling
              constants, which depend on the average dihedral angle between the planes
              defined by the C-C bond and the bonds from these central carbon atoms to their
              substituents.   The initial emphasis will be on repeating and reinterpreting
              measurements on succinic acid (HOCOCH2CH2CO2H) and its salts reported by Prof.
              Chidichimo at the University of Calabria.  Extensions will include other
              solvent systems, including lyotropic media, and other molecules, such as
              aminoacids.

The proposed research involves a fundamental question in organic
              chemistry:  What determines the angle of rotation about carbon-carbon single
              bonds in organic molecules, many of which contain C-C bonds that can be
              regarded as 1,2-disubstituted ethanes.   These angles determine the 3D
              structures, and many of the properties, of many organic molecules, including
              those involved in biological systems.   In addition to shedding light on an
              important subject, the work is expected to provide excellent training for the
              postdoctoral and undergraduate students involved.
