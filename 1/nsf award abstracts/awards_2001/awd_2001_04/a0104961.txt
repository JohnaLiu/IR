Abstract    :
              This research investigates the evolution of cooperative display behavior in
              lance-tailed manakins (Pipridae; Chiroxiphia lanceolata).  These small,
              neotropical birds have a unique mating system that requires two males to
              cooperate in an elaborate courtship song and dance in order to attract a mate. 
              When a female is receptive, the subordinate male leaves and only the dominant
              male copulates.  There is no apparent conflict between the males.  This sort of
              cooperation contradicts current evolutionary thought, which predicts that
              indviduals act to maximize their own reproductive success.  This study will
              test a series of hypotheses that could explain the adaptive advantage of
              cooperation for subordinate males.  This research represents the first thorough
              study of lance-tailed manakins.
