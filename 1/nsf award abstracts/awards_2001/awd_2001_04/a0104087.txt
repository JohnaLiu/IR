This project concerns
              the theory of chaotic dynamical systems.  The research explores mathematical
              phenomena that are relevant to the modeling of nonlinear physical systems and
              the analysis of experimental data.  We consider the method commonly used by
              scientists to "reconstruct" the dynamics of a nonlinear physical system from
              experimental data, and we study the mathematical relationship between the
              reconstructed dynamics and the true dynamics.  We will also develop methods for
              forecasting the behavior of spatiotemporally chaotic systems, such as the
              Earth's weather, given limited measurements of the state of the system. 
              Further, we will study fractal measures that arise in chaotic fluid flow and
              their application to problems of mixing and magnetic field generation.
              

Chaotic dynamics has been observed in many aspects of nature; in weather,
              it has been called the "butterfly effect."  Chaos can be an obstacle in some
              cases (limiting the predictability of the weather) and an asset in others (such
              as industrial mixing applications).  Our research concerns the mathematics
              behind the methods scientists use to model and forecast chaotic systems.  Our
              intent is both to examine the validity of apparently useful but unproven
              methods, and to develop new and improved methods.  Long-term benefits may range
              from better weather forecasts to more efficient procedures for mixing
              chemicals.
