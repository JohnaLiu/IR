The
              project concerns the development and analysis of new 
asymptotic methods to
              study short wavelength solutions of 
nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential
              equations.  
Short wavelength asymptotics, also known as geometric 
optics,
              is one of the most penetrating and widely 
applicable methods for analyzing
              partial differential 
equations.  Traditionally applied to linear problems,
              the 
method has recently been employed to furnish rigorous 
results in the
              nonlinear context.  This project continues 
the development of the method for
              treatment of nonlinear 
problems. Special emphasis is placed on analysis of
              
solutions that model ultrashort laser pulses and on the 
behavior of both
              wave trains and pulses upon crossing 
focal points.

This project develops
              new mathematical tools to describe 
the propagation of waves whose form is
              that of short 
pulses.  The technique, called asymptotic analysis, 
studies
              such pulses in the limit as the wavelength of the 
pulse becomes shorter and
              shorter.  In such limiting 
situations, much can be learned about solutions of
              the 
underlying equations, which express physical laws such as 
Newton's
              second law for fluids or the laws of 
electromagnetism. This project develops
              the technique to 
analyze important nonlinear equations that arise in a
              
variety of applications.  Special attention is given to 
diffractive effects
              that occur when rays of geometric 
optics stay close together for long times,
              and to the 
effects that occur when pulses focus in a nonlinear 
regime. 
              Promising preliminary results show that standard 
numerical techniques can be
              improved in both accuracy and 
simplicity.  The results of this project will
              yield 
reliable procedures for numerical simulations of 
important physical
              systems, including lasers that produce 
ultrashort pulses.
