Abstract    :
              Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are the most common kind of beneficial fungi
              associated with plant roots. This study tests the hypothesis that light
              availability and AMF interact to influence the composition of the remarkably
              diverse plant communities in Midwestern oak savannas. Plants in sunnier areas
              have greater needs for soil nutrients, and so may benefit more from AMF (or
              from highly active AMF species) than plants in shady sites.  Plants in shady
              sites should either lack AMF or be associated with species having lower
              metabolic rates. Shifts in the kinds and numbers of fungal species along
              sun-to-shade gradients may thus have a profound effect on the identity and
              diversity of savanna plants.  To test these ideas, we will first measure the
              distributions of plant species and AMF species as a function of light
              availability and soil texture in three Wisconsin savannas. The effects of AMF
              on understory plants will then be evaluated by applying fungicide to
              experimental field plots and documenting changes in plant composition over a
              two-year period relative to untreated plots.  Finally, we will conduct
              experiments under greenhouse conditions to determine the effects of different
              AMF species on the growth of individual plant species when they are grown
              alone, and on the competitive ability of those same species when grown
              together.
