This award supports Kevin Smith and students from Boston
              University in a collaboration with Ralf Nyholm at the MAX-lab synchrotron
              radiation facility in the University of Lund, Sweden.  The project will focus
              on the study of structural properties of wide band gap nitride semiconductors
              using photoelectron microscopy, in which area Professor Nyholm is an expert.
              The new collaborations will combine the skills of the two labs to address
              issues of fundamental importance in nitride semiconductors, and a high level of
              productivity is expected from combining the separate but complementary
              expertise of the U.S. and Swedish groups.  Among the specific goals of the
              proposed work are an understanding of microscopic surface electronic properties
              of clean binary nitride semiconductors, understanding adsorption of simple gas
              molecules on well-characterized nitride surfaces, understanding growth,
              structure, and stability of metal contact overlayers, understanding the thermal
              decomposition of complex nitride alloy surfaces, and training of students.
