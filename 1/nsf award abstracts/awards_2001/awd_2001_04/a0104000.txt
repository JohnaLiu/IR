The PI will study the ``finite type" invariants of knots
              and
3-manifolds by using techniques from classical 3-dimensional
topology and
              search for geometric information encoded in these
invariants. First, she will
              continue her work on developing the
theory of finite type invariants for knots
              and links in arbitrary
3-manifolds by using techniques from the theory of
              atoroidal
decompositions of 3-manifolds.  She also plans to work on
relating
              the Vassiliev knot invariants to properties of Seifert
surfaces spanned by the
              knots and to intrinsic invariants of the
knot complement. This will extend
              classical results about the
topology of the Alexander polynomial to the Jones
              polynomial and
its generalizations. Finally, the PI plans to search
              for
relations between the Jones polynomial of a knot and the
fundamental
              group of 3-manifolds obtained by Dehn surgery on the
knot.

The research of
              the project lies in the area of 3-dimensional
topology the central objects of
              study of which are spaces called
3-manifolds. A 3-manifold is an object that
              locally looks like
the ordinary 3-dimensional space but whose global structure
              can
be complicated.  A main goal of 3-dimensional topology is to
understand
              these structures and achieve a classification of
3-manifolds. An important
              part of 3-dimensional topology is also
the study of knots (loops embedded in
              some tangled way in
3-manifolds) and their classification. One of the ways
              that
topologists have been approaching these problems is through the
use of
              ``invariants". In the recent years, ideas originated in
physics, lead
              mathematicians to the discovery of a variety of
invariants of knots and
              3-manifolds.  The central theme of the
PI's project is to understand the
              properties of these invariants,
using ideas from traditional 3-dimensional
              topology and from
physics, and to look for applications to the
              aforementioned
classification problems.
