Abstract    :
              The PI will conduct a preliminary investigation of immunity-based computational
              techniques to pave the way for more complex studies of this subject in the
              future.  The ultimate goal of this research is to develop computational
              techniques inspired by the natural immune system for solving real-world science
              and engineering problems.  The natural immune system is a distributed
              novel-pattern recognizer which uses intelligent mechanisms to detect a wide
              variety of antigens (novel patterns).   From the computational point of view
              the immune system uses learning, memory, and associative retrieval to solve
              recognition and classification tasks.   The immune system is a subject of great
              research interest, not only in the hope of finding cures for many diseases but
              also as a means for understanding its powerful information processing
              capabilities.   In the current project the PI will investigate immunological
              principles, explore the underlying concepts and mechanisms, and take initial
              steps towards the development of intelligent computational techniques for
              solving problems in the field of science and engineering.
