This award supports travel of fifteen US participants to a
              transatlantic workshop, "New Combustion Models with Practical Fuels,"
              associated with the meeting of the Italian Section of the Combustion Institute
              in Portofino, Italy, September 16-19, 2001. The organizers are Ishwar Puri, of
              the University of Illinois at Chicago, Tiziano Faravelli and Eliseo Ranzi at
              the Polytechnic of Milan, Italy, and Antonio Cavaliere at the University of
              Naples, Italy.  The objective of the project is to consider issues related to
              the current understanding and future challenges related to new combustion
              models in the context of practical fuels.  Specifically, the workshop will
              address the flame chemistry of realistic fuels, the nature of the reaction
              zones in "new" combustion models, and state relationships for the laminar
              flamelet approach.

 The workshop will be specifically designed to encourage
              international research collaboration through the development of a research
              agenda.  International research experiences fur undergraduates, graduates, and
              postdoctoral researchers will be developed under the aegis of the Student
              Transatlantic Engineering Program at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
