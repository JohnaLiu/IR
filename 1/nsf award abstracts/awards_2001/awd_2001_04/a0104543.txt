Abstract    :
              The Wildlife Conservation Society seeks funding for a three-year project to
              develop an after school and Saturday program for 180 high school students from
              the Bronx in New York City.  The families are all low-income and 85% are below
              the poverty level.  Students will attend sessions two times a week after school
              from 2:30pm-5:00pm for 18 weeks; one-half day on Saturday per session will also
              be included.  Sessions will be held in the spring and fall, and will include a
              total of 180 students over the three years of the project. The science content
              will be based on the Wildlife Inquiry through Zoo Education (WIZE) curriculum
              materials developed by the Bronx Zoo and supplemented with hands-on activities
              at the Zoo.  The program will bring students from Bronx-area high schools to
              the Bronx Zoo where they will learn to observe, formulate hypotheses, collect
              data, analyze and present the data.  Student will learn aspects of ecology,
              anatomy, animal behavior, food webs and chains, etc.  Participating students
              will receive high school credit from the city of New York for participating. 
              The Institute for Learning Innovation, an Annapolis, MD-based, non-profit
              educational research and development organization, will conduct
              formative/remedial and summative evaluation of the implementation and long-term
              impact of the program.
