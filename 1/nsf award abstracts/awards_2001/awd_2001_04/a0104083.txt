Abstract    :
              Professor Mark E. Welker in the Department of Chemistry at Wake Forest
              University is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for
              his studies on the development of exo-selective and/or enantioselective
              Diels-Alder reactions that are catalyzed by transition metals.  Series of
              chiral ligands, transition metals, and reducing agents that do not react or
              react very slowing with the dienophile carbonyl and double bonds will be
              screened for their efficacy in the catalytic cycle.  This methodology will be
              used to synthesize several cis-decalin ring systems related to biologically
              significant compounds.

With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular
              Program, Professor Welker is investigating new ways to form six-membered rings
              with precise control over the three-dimensional spatial arrangement of the
              substituents.  These reactions will be catalyzed by small amounts of transition
              metals.  By using catalytic amounts, savings in terms of material and waste
              disposal costs will be realized.  The new methodology also will be utilized to
              prepare the bicyclic core structures of several biologically active organic
              compounds.
