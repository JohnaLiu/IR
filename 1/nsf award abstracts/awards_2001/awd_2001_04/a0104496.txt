Abstract    :
              Mueller
0104496
This US-Chile grant will allow Dr. Peter Mueller of Duke
              University to travel to Santiago, Chile to work with Dr. Fernando Quintana at
              Pontifica Universidad Catolica de Chile.  Their work concerns the use of
              Bayesian statistics to study data in the form of binary sequences.
              
Specifically, the collaborators will study issues of inference, model
              selection, and design choice when binary sequences are considered.  These
              sequences often arise when dealing with longitudinal models with binary
              observables, often encountered in biomedical applications. Primary
              responsibility for modeling and simulation will be with the Chilean
              investigator; responsibility for the development and implementation of the
              optimal design schemes with the U.S. investigator.
