Shrout
This U.S.- Chile Program award provides support for cooperative
              research between Dr. Thomas R. Shrout of Penn State University and Dr. Mauricio
              E. Pilleux of Universidad de Chile in Santiago, Chile, to carry out research
              involving the use of copper powder to replace noble metals in designing
              multi-layer electroceramic materials.

The collaboration will combine the
              expertise in surface physics and thin film dielectrics at the Universidad de
              Chile with the expertise in electronic ceramics of researchers at the Materials
              Research Laboratory at Penn State.  Layers of dielectric ceramics have a wide
              variety of industrial applications, including actuators, sensors, ultrasonic
              transducers, voltage transformers, and dielectric capacitors.  This research
              may lead to important applications in the manufacture of multi-layer
              ceramics.
