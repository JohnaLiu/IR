Abstract    :
              As it developed its guide on Enhancing the Postdoctoral Experience of Scientists
              and Engineers, the Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy
              (COSEPUP)--a joint committee of the National Academy of Science, National
              Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine--found that action was
              needed by postdocs, postdoc advisers, administrators, funding organizations,
              and disciplinary societies and developed a set of recommendations for each.  It
              also found tht more dialogue was needed amongst all these parties in order to
              enhance the postdoctoral experience.  Therefore, COSEPUP decided to host a
              Convocation on Enhancing the Postdoctoral Experience of Scientists and
              Engineers to bring all these parties together to facilitate dialogue, highlight
              best practices, and encourage action on the part of all.  This convocation will
              take place on March 2, 2001.  The National Academies are requesting $25,000 to
              provide travel support for postocs to attend the Convoation.
