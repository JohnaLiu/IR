Abstract    :
              The inherent speed and potential for parallel processing make signal
              manipulation in the optical domain an attractive alternative, but one that
              requires the ability to produce well-defined nonlinear functions (e.g.,
              wavelength conversion, phase-preserving optical multiplication, logic
              operations), as well as to direct the optical intermediates and outputs as
              necessary. We propose to expand our exploration of a new class of photonic
              devices which possess both of these characteristicst nonlinear photonic
              crystals (NLPCs). We show theoretically that the structure of an NLPC can be
              successfully determined for a particular nonlinear optical application - a
              one-step interchange of optical data between two wavelength division
              multiplexed (WDM) channels. Preliminary measurements confirm the success of
              this inversion problem (i.e., desired output 4 NLPC structure). We propose to
              explore the properties of this and related lattice-based devices and circuits.
              We also intend to extend this work to quasi-periodic and aperiodic nonlinear
              optical geometries, and to nonlinear distributions based on nanoscale domain
              distributions. We believe that this research direction will continue to uncover
              new and powerful applications of all-optical elements for a wide range of
              disciplines, including telecommunications, signal processing, and remote
              sensing.
