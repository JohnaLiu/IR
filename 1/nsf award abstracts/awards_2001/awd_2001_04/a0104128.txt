Abstract for DMS - 0104128

This project is concerned with the structure of
              smoothly curved spaces
on a small but definite scale, with the partial
              reularity and singularity
structure of limit cases of such spaces, with the
              relations between analysis
and geometry on metric measure spaces, and with the
              structure of 
nonpositively curved spaces.  Specifically, we will continue our
              investigations
of manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded below and their weak
              limits,
of Einstein manifolds and their weak limits, of metric measure
              spaces
for which a doubling condition and Poincar\'e inequality hold, and
              of
compact nonpositively curved manifolds whose volume is sufficiently
              small.


Smoothly curved spaces (the higher dimensional generalizations of
              curved
surfaces) play an important role in geometry and in physics.
A central
              issue is to describe the ``worst possible'' examples of spaces
the curvature
              is controlled in some specific fashion, and,   
what is very closely related,
              to describe the kinds singularities which can 
form in limiting cases. This 
              study is the main concern of our project.
An example (from a somewhat
              different domain) 
of what we mean by the ``formation of singularities'',
              
one can think of the formation of ``black holes''.
