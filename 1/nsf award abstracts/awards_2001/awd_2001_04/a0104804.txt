Abstract    :
              
Despite numerous studies, it is still unclear how biodiversity affects
              ecosystem function. This research will evaluate whether interspecific effects
              overshadow intraspecific variation in influencing ecosystem dynamics.  A field
              experiment being conducted as part of this dissertation has found that genetic
              makeup of leaf litter affected components of the carbon and nitrogen cycles by
              influencing tannin content, decomposition rate, and nitrogen content. Low
              genetic diversity yielded idiosyncratic nutrient cycles that differed
              significantly from high diversity treatments. While this project is unique in
              its focus on intraspecific, and not interspecific diversity, the implications
              need to be considered in relation to interspecific diversity. Specifically,
              will the effects of decreased intraspecific diversity be masked by the addition
              of a single commonly co-occurring species? To answer this, the PIs propose to
              replicate field experiments in the lab with and without the addition of
              naturally co-occurring pine litter. By comparing carbon and nitrogen dynamics
              of oak litter with and without pine litter, the PIs will be able to assess the
              effects of additional species in the community on the ecosystem-level
              consequences of reduced intraspecific genetic diversity
