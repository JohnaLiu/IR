Abstract    :
              California State University-Los Angeles seeks funding for a 36-month endeavor
              for an after school "Science, Technology and Engineering Program (STEP) Up for
              Youth" ASCEND project.  "STEP Up for Youth" is a community-based, informal
              science exploration and discovery initiative targeting middle school youths and
              their parents in disadvantaged communities of Los Angeles.  The project
              provides participants with standards-based, hands-on science activities and
              opportunities for participation in science clubs.  They are also provided the
              opportunity for leadership roles in building institutionalized programs for
              furthering science literacy in their respective communities.  The project is a
              collaborative effort involving California State University-Los Angeles, the
              NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, The California Science Center, The Boeing
              Company and the Los Angeles Unified School District, in partnership with
              community-based organizations, service providers and neighborhood businesses.
