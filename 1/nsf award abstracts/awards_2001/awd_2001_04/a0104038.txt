Abstract    :
              This proposal is concerned with the analysis of large data with many dimensions.
              For a variety of reasons, it is often desirable to reduce the dimensionality
              first. Using the techniques of sliced inverse regression and principal Hessian
              directions as building blocks, new methods are developed for more complex
              applications involving many input and output variables simultaneously. When the
              variables consist of time series or curves, automatic basis searching systems
              are derived for modeling both the deterministic trends and the stochastic
              patterns.  

Scientific data from a variety of disciplines have accumulated
              in unprecedented volume and complexity. This is exemplified by the massive gene
              expression profiles generated by microarray technologies. Hidden under many
              public accessible rich databases is a gold mine of biological messages,
              awaiting genomic researchers' exploration. Powerful statistical methods from
              clustering and classification have been successfully applied to dig them out.
              But the variety of information that can be distilled is so diverse that the
              pursuit of new paths is more than warranted. The new methods developed in this
              project will meet this demand. In particular, they can be used to visualize
              both the local and the global interaction in gene expression, to infer
              metabolic circuitry and enzyme functionality, to shed light on the multi-task
              coordination at different stages of the cell cycle, and to explore the
              relationship between drug responsiveness and gene profiles.
