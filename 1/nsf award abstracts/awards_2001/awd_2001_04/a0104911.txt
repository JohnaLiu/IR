Significant regulation of gene expression occurs at
              many levels after transcription of genetic information into messenger RNA. 
              This meeting will focus on mechanisms of RNA regulation, from transcription in
              the nucleus until the encoded genetic information has been converted to protein
              via translation.  Until recently, post-transcriptional events, such as mRNA
              processing, mRNA decay, and translation have not been studied extensively in
              plants.  However, exciting new discoveries have revealed a plethora of
              post-transcriptional control events ranging from the subtle (e.g., mRNA
              stability) to the sublime (e.g., post-transcriptional gene silencing).  The
              plenary speakers will cover diverse biological functions such as host-pathogen
              interactions, abiotic stress response, chloroplast function, and plant
              development.  The following specific topics will be covered: RNA-mediated,
              post-transcriptional gene silencing; suppression of gene silencing; mRNA
              turnover; pre-mRNA splicing; novel viral mRNA translation mechanisms;
              translational control of plant genes; and bioinformatics and genomics. 
              Attendees of this meeting will come away with an increased awareness of the
              amazing diversity of gene expression mechanisms.  Furthermore, this meeting
              will highlight the need for further research into understanding
              post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression as more eukaryotic genomes
              are nearing completion and new genes are discovered.
