Title:		Dissertation Research: Differences in foraging behavior among
              multiple		predator species: Implications for prey communities

By studying
              isolated subcomponents of complex systems, many assume that the processes
              observed in such small subsets can be added together to predict phenomena in
              the larger system.  This assumption is inherent in predation theory, yet many
              recent studies report that the impacts of particular predators in isolation
              with their prey cannot be added together to predict the impact of multiple
              predator species simultaneously.  The ability to predict conditions under which
              higher or lower rates of predation than expected will occur is crucial to
              determining patterns of mortality in prey populations.  A lab experiment
              involving predators that use similar foraging behaviors and those that use
              different foraging behaviors will be used to test hypotheses about the combined
              effects of predation by multiple predator species.  This experiment will
              provide knowledge about the level of predation risk that prey face and has
              implications for biodiversity by demonstrating the factors influencing the
              distribution and abundance of species in nature.  This study will improve our
              ability to predict the effect of invasive predator species on native
              communities.
