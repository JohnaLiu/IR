Abstract    :
              Annual reproductive output has been shown to be a major factor affecting the
              recruitment, and hence the abundance, of Neotropical migrant birds.  This study
              will identify and evaluate the mechanism(s) driving reproductive output that
              are critical to understanding current and future population trends of these
              species, many of which are declining.  A review of the literature and analysis
              of breeding data on Black-throated Blue Warblers (Dendroica caerulescens)
              reveals that an important factor affecting the number of breeding attempts, and
              hence productivity, is territory level-food availability.  This study will test
              to see if food is a causal factor using a food supplementation experiment.
              Additionally, observational data will be collected to test the alternative
              hypotheses that nest site availability, male assistance/protection, or female
              quality drives the number of breeding attempts and therefore annual
              reproductive output.  

This research contributes to current knowledge by
              examining population-level questions from the perspective of the individual
              female.  Using a mechanistic approach, coupled with modeling this study will
              provide information necessary to assess how species respond to perturbations,
              which is especially import in light of proposed changes in species abundance
              due to global warming, habitat fragmentation, and other anthropogenic effects.
