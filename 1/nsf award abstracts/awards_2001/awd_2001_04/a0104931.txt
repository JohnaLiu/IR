Abstract    :
              Iron plays an important role in the function and productivity of aquatic
              ecosystems, either directly, via effects on biogeochemistry and nutrient
              cycling, or indirectly, via effects on plankton community composition. Dr.
              Brzezinski and Ms. Franck would like to explore the ways in which iron
              availability can regulate diatom production and macronutrient cycling in the
              Polar Frontal Zone in the Pacific Sector of the Southern Ocean and in the
              highly productive upwelling areas off the coast of California and Peru. All are
              regions where large diatoms blooms and net CO2 drawdown can occur, but where
              iron (Fe) and silicon (Si) availability may play a role in regulating the
              timing and occurrence of these blooms and the magnitude of CO2 uptake. In this
              work the investigators will quantify the effects of Fe availability on Si and
              nitrate biogeochemistry, as well as look for mechanisms behind the observed
              effects, e.g. how Fe availability alters Si and nitrate uptake kinetics, diatom
              species composition and species-specific Si uptake.
