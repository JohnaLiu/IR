Abstract    :
              The project will examine the effects of a major biological change that has
              occurred recently in the Bering Sea.  Once a diatom-dominated ocean, the Bering
              Sea has changed to a coccolithophore-dominated ocean.  The dramatic change in
              phytoplankton abundance has many ramifications, not the least of which is that
              coccolithophores emit the gases Dimethylsulfide (DMS) and dimethylsulfoxide
              (DMSO).  DMS and DMSO are greenhouse gases and the introduction of these gases
              in the Arctic could lead to enhanced warming of the region and concomitant
              effects beyond the Arctic.
