Abstract    :
              This MPS Distinguished International Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (MPS-DRF)
              award supports a research project in the study of quantum gases, or
              Bose-Einstein condensates, an area that brings quantum mechanics from the level
              of a single atom to millions of atoms.  The proposed research will study
              vortices, a fundamental structure in Bose-Einstein condenstaes, at the Ecole
              Normale Superieure in Paris.  The research will be undertaken in collaboration
              with other theoretical and experimental groups in Europe and the US,
              specifically at Oxford University in England, at the F.O.M. Institute in
              Amsterdam, and at the National Institute for Standards and Technology.
