Abstract    :
              This project explores the preparation, properties and chemistry of
              dehydrobenzannulenes.  These molecules are related to such substances as
              buckminsterfullerenes in having an almost all-carbon composition.  Unlike
              fullerenes, dehydrobenzannulenes can vary in structure quite radically and
              rationally designed structures are accessible by total synthesis.  The aim of
              this research project is to prepare and study dehydrobenzannulenes with novel
              shapes in order to answer fundamental scientific questions as well as to
              explore the materials propertied of the resultant macromolecules.

With this
              Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support
              for the research and educational activities of Professor Michael M. Haley of
              the University of Oregon, Eugene.  Professor Haley's research explores the
              preparation and properties of macromolecular, carbon-rich dehydrobenzannulenes.
               These novel macromolecules can be as large as several nanometers in diameter
              and offer the prospect of novel properties including, but not limted to
              nonlinear optical properties.  In addition to his work with doctoral and
              postdoctoral scientists, Professor Haley also includes undergraduate students
              of chemistry in his research programs.
