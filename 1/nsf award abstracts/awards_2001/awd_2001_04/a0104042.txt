Research under this award will be
              conducted in the areas of
Lorentzian and Riemannian geometry, with
              applications to General
Relativity and String Theory.  One of the specific
              aims of this
project is to investigate the global structure of
              asymptotically
locally anti-de Sitter spacetimes, especially in connection
              with
the AdS/CFT correspondence. We continue investigations into
              the
relationship of the topology of an asymptotically locally
anti-de Sitter
              spacetime and that of its conformal
boundary-at-infinity, and undertake a
              study of certain
topological and geometrical properties of higher
              dimensional
black holes, and related objects arising in string
              theory,
including certain solitions conjectured to be least
              energy
configurations. Another aim of this project is to
              continue
investigations into spacetime rigidity phenomena associated with
the
              occurence of timelike lines and null lines.  Applications of
the null
              splitting theorem will be considered, and a new
approach to well-known
              conjectures concerning the rigidity of
the singularity theorems is proposed
              for study.

Modern theories of gravity are geometrical in nature. 
              The
gravitational field and other fields, black holes and related
objects,
              may be described and analyzed using geometric methods.
In more general terms,
              this project is concerned with the study
of certain features of gravity of
              current scientific interest
from this geometric point of view, utilizing the
              tools of
Riemannian geometry, a mathematical theory of space, and
Lorentzian
              geometry, a mathematical theory of spacetime.  These
theories provide a method
              for studying the relationship among
three fundamental aspects of the spacetime
              universe: curvature
(i.e., the bending of space or spacetime), topology (i.e.,
              the
global shape and complexity of space or spacetime) and causal
structure
              (i.e., the large scale behavior of light rays and
light cones).
