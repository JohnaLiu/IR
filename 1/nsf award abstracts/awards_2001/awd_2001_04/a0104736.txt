Abstract    :
              "Galaxy Explorers" submitted by the Chabot Space and Science Center (CSSC) will
              recruit 225 students from 75 East Bay high schools in the Oakland, CA area. 
              The project engages students in extensive training over a three-year period. 
              The major training components develop students' content knowledge and job
              skills training while providing internship and volunteer opportunities.  The
              project model builds on lessons learned from two previous projects:  "Giants of
              Science" and the "Teen Volunteer Program."  As in these two projects, the
              "Galaxy Explorers" project will focus on helping students see the relevance of
              science to their everyday lives.  Guest speakers and CSSC staff will use a
              variety of educational approaches, including hands-on lab activities,
              technology and interactive presentations to engage students in scientific
              investigations.
