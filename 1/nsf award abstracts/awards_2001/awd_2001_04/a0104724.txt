Abstract    :
              The Exploratorium will develop a series of Internet resources on three popular
              topics -- cooking, gardening, and making music -- to encourage users in science
              education activities in relation to daily activities.  The three-year project
              will include the development and testing of resources that explore the science
              behind these topics, using the notion that we all, consciously or not, are
              "accidental scientists" who engage in the scientific process in the course of
              everyday life.  Target audiences include general public adults and youth. 
              Components of the site will feature aspects of cooking, gardening, and making
              music that are intended to appeal to diverse communities.  The resources will
              also serve formal education through the Exploratorium's national and local
              network of educators.
