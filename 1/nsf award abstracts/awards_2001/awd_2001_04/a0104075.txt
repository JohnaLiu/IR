Abstract    :
              In non and semiparametric inference Bickel, in collaboration with 
Ritov and
              others, proposes to study how an increasing but 
proportionally vanishingly
              small cross validation sample can be used 
systematically to optimize
              supervised learning (classification and 
regression) procedures, for example
              ADA BOOST.  Further they propose 
to study a unified theory for testing of
              semiparametric hypotheses 
and develop efficient tests for bioequivalence.  In
              dependent data 
models, they propose to extend previous results on Hidden
              Markov 
models to state space models and study how procedures obtained by
              
fitting and use of approximate likelihoods such as particle filters
              
behave.

The investigator and collaborators propose to analyze and develop
              new 
effective methods for identifying (by machine) the type of a newly
              
perceived object or predicting some feature from historical 
information. 
              This ranges from machine reading of hand written zip 
codes to predicting
              travel times of cars from one destination to 
another to predicting tumor type
              from microarray data.  In a similar 
direction they propose to see how well
              computer simulation based 
approximations to ideal prediction methods work in
              very complicated 
models applying to situations such as voice recognition. 
              Further 
they propose to study methods of inference bearing on questions such
              
as whether a new drug which may be more expensive and have 
side-effects is
              sufficiently better than drugs currently in use to be 
authorized for
              distribution.
