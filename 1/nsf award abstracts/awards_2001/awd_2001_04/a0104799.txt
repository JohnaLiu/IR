This award supports theoretical research and education on
              strongly correlated electron materials and systems.  The work will make
              extensive use of field-theoretic techniques with an emphasis on
              non-perturbative methods. Research will focus on electronic materials and
              systems for which the Fermi liquid paradigm does not apply and often does not
              even provide a qualitative description of the correlated electronic states.
              Research areas that will be engaged include: disordered systems in two
              dimensions, including the transition between plateaus in the quantum Hall
              effect; spin-charge separation in lattice gauge theories on high temperature
              superconductors; correlation functions for Haldane-gap spin chains; the
              existence of Lifshitz points in chiral field theories; and tunneling into a
              fractional quantum Hall device.  The techniques of integrable field theory will
              be used, which include conformal field theory, the Bethe ansatz, and the exact
              scattering matrix description.

This award supports fundamental
              theoretical research and education on strongly correlated electron materials
              and systems. The PI will apply state-of-the-art field theoretic techniques to
              central problems in the field of strongly correlated electron materials with an
              aim to understand how electronic states arise that differ from the Fermi liquid
              states observed in ordinary metals.
