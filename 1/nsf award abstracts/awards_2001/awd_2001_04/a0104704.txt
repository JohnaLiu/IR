Abstract    :
              The Cornell Lab of Ornithology (CLO) will develop "Understanding Birds", a suite
              of exhibits and related programming in the new environmental science center to
              be opened in Sapsucker Woods in 2002.  The new building will house the Lab's
              research, education, and outreach operations, including the Library of Natural
              Sounds, a new Library of Nature Videos, and Cornell's systematic collection of
              vertebrates.  The building also will include a multi-media-based interactive
              Visitors Center providing both real and virtual learning activities for
              visitors of all ages, backgrounds and skill levels.  Plans for replication of
              the exhibits will be made available broadly to museums, nature centers and
              other organizations.
