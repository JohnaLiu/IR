Abstract    :
              The Pacific Science Center, in collaboration and with support from the
              Washington NASA Space Grant Consortium, proposes a three-year program to
              develop and test a model for delivering mid-scale, astronomy and space-themed
              exhibits and programming in a shopping center environment, especially in rural
              locations.
The program targets an audience that does not have easy access to a
              science center or that may not be inclined to take advantage of such a
              facility.  The exhibits and curriculum for this project will be based on
              Pacific Science Center's well-tested Space Odyssey Van Program, which presently
              tours elementary schools in Washington State.  Phase One of the project will be
              a test delivery of the existing exhibits and programming to two malls.  Phase
              Two involves construction and testing of the final, larger exhibits and
              reworking existing programming to better fit a mall delivery  environment. 
              Phase Three takes the newly tested devices to ten malls in suburban and rural
              Washington.
