Abstract    :
              0104740  Alvarez-Cohen  The objectives of this research are to characterize the
              microbial diversity in consortia capable of reductively dechlorinating
              chlorinated ethenes to determine the roles of different physiological groups in
              those reactions, to isolate pure cultures capable of complete dechlorination of
              trichloroethene (TCE), and to construct simple consortia capable of rapid,
              stable growth and efficient, complete dechlorination of TCE.  Various molecular
              techniques will be used in this study, including clone library
              construction/analysis, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism
              (T-RFLP) analysis, and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis.  The
              anticipated results of this study will provide fundamental information on the
              diversity, physiology and biochemistry of microbial species involved in
              complete reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes.  This information is
              needed for designing efficient treatment processes for remediating chlorinated
              ethene contaminated sites.  This research project will advance the development
              of molecular biological techniques as tools for evaluating and monitoring
              reductive dechlorination in contaminated subsurface environments.  Also, it
              could lead to the development of microbial consortia appropriate for
              application in bioaugmentation strategies for site remediation. ***
