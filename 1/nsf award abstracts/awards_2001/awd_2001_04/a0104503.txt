This US-Brazil proposal provides support for Drs. David P.
              O'Brien and Patricia J. Brooks of CUNY Baruch College to work with Professors
              Antonio Roazzi and Maria G. Dias at Universidade Federal de Pernambuco in
              Recife and Dr. Wany Sampaio of Universidade Federal de Rondonia in Brazil, on
              cross cultural and development perspectives on the language of thought.  NSF's
              Developmental and Learning Sciences Program is providing co-funding.
This
              project involves the investigation of reasoning skills of people of different
              ages, in the U.S. and Brazil, who speak English, Portuguese, and Tupi Kawahib
              dialect.  It also will examine the reasoning skills of speakers who have
              learned language in diverse ways - oral literate, oral illiterate, and deaf. 
              Of particular importance is the planned investigation of members of a recently
              discovered indigenous tribal group in the southwestern Amazon Basin, the
              Amondawa, which had its first contact with the outside world in 1986.  Before
              that, it was a stone-age hunter/gatherer group. (This portion of the research
              will be possible because of the participation of Dr. Wany Sampaio of the
              Federal University of Rondonia, who has been studying the language of this
              group for the past six years.)
