This work will study the divergence of duplicated genes in two
              plant model organisms:  Arabidopsis thaliana and Zea mays (corn).   The
              Arabidopsis work will use computational tools to examine differences among 271
              duplicated gene pairs found within the Arabidopsis genome.  The purposes of the
              Arabidopsis study are to infer the processes of diversification after gene
              duplication and also to search for sequence-based clues for shifts in gene
              function.   The second part of the research uses a unique population-based
              approach to examine divergence of duplicated genes.  For this part of the
              project, DNA sequence data will be generated from several individuals from each
              gene of several duplicate gene pairs.  This population-based approach will
              provide additional information about the forces governing gene divergence and
              may also yield insights into the function of several agronomically important
              genes.

The genomics revolution has produced whole-genome sequences from
              myriad organisms ranging from bacteria to humans.   Genomic sequences provide a
              blueprint of genetic architecture, but the more difficult work is just
              beginning - i.e., to infer gene function and gene origin.   One surprise
              gleaned from genome data is that all organisms have a very high proportion of
              duplicated genes.  It is not yet clear if the two (or more) duplicate copies
              retain the same gene function as the ancestral gene or instead diverge to
              fulfill new functional roles.  Knowing how genes diverge after gene duplication
              is essential for understanding genome evolution and will in turn help us
              understand the basis of genetic differences among organisms.
