Abstract    :
              This creative project pairs grandparents or other senior citizens with children
              in grades K-7 for an intergenerational hands-on SMT program.  The OASIS
              institute, which has a large national membership of adults 55 and older with
              centers based in 25 cities across the US, is the source of adults.  Twenty
              intergenerational modules will be developed which address the learning styles
              of both children and older adults, half of which will be linked with the
              NSF-funded "Find Out Why" materials.  Master training sessions will be
              conducted for OASIS trainers, who would then train volunteers at their local
              centers.  Anticipated outcomes include increased knowledge of standards-based
              SMT concepts, enhanced problem-solving skills and a better understanding of how
              science, math and technology apply to everyday life.  In addition to the
              modules, the program would also result in the creation of a supplementary guide
              for volunteers, materials kits and a comprehensive training program.  It is
              anticipated that this exciting program will be piloted in the following nine
              states:  MO, IN, OR, MD, AZ, TX, CA, IL and OH. Over 100,000 individuals will
              be impacted during the three years of the project.
