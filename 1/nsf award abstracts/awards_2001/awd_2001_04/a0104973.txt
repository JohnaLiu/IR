              The function of multiple signals in avian vocal communication

The puzzling occurrence of highly conspicuous
              traits in the males of many species of animals is thought to be explained by
              the fact that these traits act as signals to potential mates, indicating
              something about phenotypic or genotypic quality. This apparent resolution,
              however, does not easily explain cases in which individuals exhibit more than
              one conspicuous trait. For example, many songbirds use a combination of bright
              coloration and complex vocal displays in courtship, or multiple kinds of
              courtship vocalizations. If an individual trait can act as an indicator of male
              quality, what is the added function, if any, of possessing two or more such
              traits? The goal of this project is to study the function of multiple vocal
              traits in the yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia), and test a hypothesis for
              how different traits of an individual might function as signals. As with
              several groups of North American and European songbirds, yellow warblers have
              two distinct modes of singing: one relatively simple and one more complex.
              Results from previous work suggest that these singing modes are specialized for
              communicating different messages to males and females. This hypothesis will be
              evaluated using a combination of field and laboratory studies to examine three
              important aspects of signal function: how the singing modes are used by males,
              what kinds of information the singing modes convey, and how males and females
              respond to the different singing modes.
