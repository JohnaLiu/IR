Current patterns of association between insects and plants
              have resulted from events in which insects modify their range of acceptable
              host plants by colonizing novel host-plant species.  However, the plant traits
              that predispose insects to "shift" onto some plants instead of others are
              poorly understood.  The goals of this research are to determine (1) if
              ancestral and novel host plants share similar chemical stimulants that would
              facilitate a host shift and (2) if insect preference for these chemical cues
              has a genetic component.  This will be accomplished by investigating a host
              shift within the Papilio machaon group of swallowtail butterflies.  Butterflies
              will be tested on host plants and chemical extracts made from these plants to
              quantify preference for ancestral and novel host plants.  A heritability
              experiment will be performed to determine if preference for chemical cues is a
              heritable genetic trait.  These experiments will determine whether plant
              chemistry can act as a mechanism for insects to recognize new plant species as
              potential hosts.  

Understanding how insects incorporate new hosts into
              their diets is important because many of our worst agricultural pests have
              colonized crop plants by shifting from a native host plant to an abundant crop
              host.  Therefore, learning how plant chemistry can affect an insect's decision
              to shift to a novel host may help to reduce future colonizations by insect
              pests.
