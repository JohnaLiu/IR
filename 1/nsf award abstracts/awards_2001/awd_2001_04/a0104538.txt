Abstract    :
              The Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS) proposes to develop a permanent, one-acre,
              outdoor exhibition overlooking the San Francisco Bay called called "The Forces
              That Shape the San Francisco Bay."  The exhibition will focus on the geologic
              and hydrologic forces and the human impacts that have shaped the San Francisco
              Bay and its environs.  The exhibition's interactive components and related
              programs will involve visitors in learning about erosion, river sediment and
              deposition, mountain building, folding of strata and thrusting, faulting and
              seismicity.
