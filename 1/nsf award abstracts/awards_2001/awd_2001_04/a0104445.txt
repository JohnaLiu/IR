Abstract    :
              The research work will concern mathematical and numerical aspects of
              semiconductor manufacturing, specifically to work on problems of
              microstructural reliability, including aspects of electromigration and chemical
              mechanical polishing. The work will be combination of mathematical modeling to
              produce reasonable physical models, complete with appropriate boundary
              conditions and internal dynamics, and numerical algorithms, in part relying on
              algorithms for surface evolution and elliptic solvers in irregular domains. 
              The goal will be numerical simulations and comparisons with experiment.
