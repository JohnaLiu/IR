The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables
              U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of
              research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint
              research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and
              experimental conditions abroad.
This award will provide twenty-four months of
              support to Dr. Catherine Lebiedzik of the University of Virginia to do research
              with Dr. John Cagnol at Pole Universitaire, Leonard de Vinci, in Paris, France,
              and with Dr. Jean-Paul Zolesio at Ecole des Mines de Paris in Sophia Antipolis,
              France.  Funding for this project is provided by NSF's Math and Physical
              Sciences Directorate's Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.
The PI will
              work on the problem of reducing noise in an acoustic cavity.  The project
              involves the complex mathematical solution of a simple physical system;
              describing the physics via the acoustic wave equation embedded in an
              appropriate boundary surface.  Noise reduction is a concern in the field of
              aerospace engineering as well as an application of modern control theory of
              partial differential equations (PDEs).  The structural acoustic interaction in
              the chamber is mathematically modeled by a coupled system of PDEs.
The
              international nature for this work is necessary because the intrinsic model
              itself was first developed in France.  The French group will be responsible for
              generalizing the model to include thermoelastic effects and for assisting in
              numerical analysis with the finite element method.
