In 1999 West Nile virus (WNV) reached New York causing massive
              mortality in American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). In Tompkins County crows
              have been studied since 1990, and blood samples for DNA extraction are
              available. Since WNV will most likely reach epidemic proportions in upstate NY
              in the summer of 2001, massive mortality can be expected among crows. This
              provides a unique opportunity to determine which individuals can survive
              infection with WNV and identify the genetic component of the resistance. Large
              numbers of crows will be captured in the 2000-2001 winter and blood samples
              will be obtained for DNA analysis and serology. DNA samples will be analyzed
              for differences in immune response genes by, thus providing the basis to study
              genetic diversity before and after the onset of the expected WNV epidemic. The
              hypothesis will be validated if crows surviving the WNV epidemic differ in
              allele frequencies of genes associated with immune responses. 

Although it
              is assumed that pathogens co-evolve with the ability of the host to mount
              effective immune responses, very few studies using natural populations have
              tested the validity of this hypothesis. In order to understand the risks to
              which populations are exposed when a new disease infects them, it is important
              to compare populations before and after they are exposed to the new
              pathogen.
