Abstract    :
              The Educational Broadcasting Corporation (WNET in New York) is developing and
              producing a new public television project exploring cutting-edge technology. 
              The project consists of an eight-part hourly broadcast component; six 60-second
              "mini-programs;" a World Wide Web component; and extensive educational outreach
              targeted to adults aged 25-39 and older.  The topics for the eight programs in
              season one are:

 Replacements - prosthetic devices and biologically
              electronic artificial body parts
 In Search of Eve - the race to decode the
              human genome
 Light of the 21st Century - Fiber Optics
 Nanotechnology -
              molecular manipulation of materials
 Technospy - technologies used to gain
              information
 Sports Technology - the pursuit of better equipment and training
              regimes
 Artificial Intelligence - efforts to create computers the mimic human
              intelligence
 Appropriate Technologies - technologies that use local,
              inexpensive material

Beth Hoppe, WNET's Director of Science Programs will
              serve as Executive Producer for the series.  Each of the programs would be
              produced by an independent producer selected by WNET.  Content advisors
              include:  Angela Christiano, Departments of Dermatology, Genetics and
              Development, Columbia University; Sheila Sen Jasanoff, Harvard University JFK
              School of Government; Horace Freeland Judson, Center for History of Recent
              Science, George Washington University; Michio Kaku, theoretical physicist, CUNY
              and host, Explorations radio series; Wilfred Pinfold, Microprocessor Research
              Labs, Intel Corp.; and Barbara Wilson, chief technologist, NASA's Jet
              Propulsion Laboratory
