Abstract    :
              Professor Robert Field of MIT is supported by the Experimental Physical
              Chemistry Program for a novel study of the dynamics of energy transfer in
              molecular Rydberg states.  A nanosecond pulse will be used to prepare a
              carefully designed initial state, and a pair of scanned-delay phase-coherent IR
              femtosecond pulses will be used to study the dynamics of the initially
              localized excitation.  In particular, the first pulse is used to prepare a
              coherent superposition among a well defined set of Rydberg states, and the
              second pulse interrogates the recurrences or rephasing.   Detection will be by
              a field ionization voltage ramp.  The mechanistic details of electronic and
              nuclear energy flow will be studied, varying the extent of resonance between
              interacting states.  Alkaline earth monohalides such as CaF, CaCl and BaF
              prepared in molecular beams, previously studied by the PI in the frequency
              domain, will be utilized as model systems. 

The study of Rydberg states
              enhances our understanding of energy flow and storage in small molecules.  As
              the method is improved, it may be applied to increasingly complicated
              molecules, with potential impacts on fields such as photochemistry and quantum
              information storage.
