              Abstract NSF Proposal DMS-0104047

Speaking more technically, the proposal
              aims to treat four research
lines in complex geometry and analysis. We are
              studying the Grauert
tube construction for its rigidity and uniquesness
              properties for
large (maximal) radius or domain, and examining whether this
              point of
view adds to old questions in representation theory and automorphic
              forms.
Second, we will study a Kaehler-Einstein version of Min-Oo's
              rigidity
theorem which we conjecture to hold. We will continue work with
X.
              Gong on Levi flat hypersurfaces with singularities, especially
algebraic ones
              with isolated singularities. Their importance is
suggested by recent work of
              Siu and others proving the conjecture of
Camacho on the non-existence of
              smooth, Levi-flat hypersurfaces in
the complex projective plane. Finally we
              propose to study the rigidity
of special classes of Schubert cycles on flag
              manifolds, following
upon the work of the PI's former student M. Walters
              and,
independently, R. Bryant.


The proposal addresses several questions
              in complex analysis and
geometry. Most people are familiar with Descartes'
              analytic geometry
from high school: in most respects, this line of
              investigation is the
modern descendent of those early ideas. We will study the
              relationship
between a geometric locus, sometimes defined by equations as
              in
Descartes' original case, and its analytic properties, those
properties
              influenced by the calculus of Newton and Leibniz. In
particular we study a
              complexification of geometric locus, that is, we
add "imaginary points" to the
              geometry, related to the imaginary unit
"i", and study the influence of the
              imaginary points on the real
points and their geometry. Another portion of the
              project seeks to
understand the asymptotic, or long range properties of
              special metric
geometries related to the Einstein equations. It is well known
              that
both of these properties can be influential in physical
              applications,
and there is recent work to lead one to hope that both
              this
complexification construction and the asymptotics of Einstein
              metrics
can be used to understand parts of the so-called
              Maldacena
correspondence in theoretical physics.
