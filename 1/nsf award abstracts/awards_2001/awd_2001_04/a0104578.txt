Abstract    :
              The Buffalo Bill Historical Center will develop the "Greater Yellowstone
              Adventure project," encompassing 1,719 square meters of exhibits in the
              Center's newly constructed Draper Museum of Natural History.  The exhibits and
              associated programming constitute a major cultural and educational resource for
              underserved residents of rural, northwestern Wyoming and approximately 500,000
              annual visitors to the region.  The goal of Greater Yellowstone Adventure is to
              promote understanding of the relationships binding humans and nature and the
              use of science in exploring those relationships.  The exhibits are orgainized
              into three galleries:  Expedition Trailhead, Braided Paths and Tangled
              Destinies, and Seasons of Discovery.
