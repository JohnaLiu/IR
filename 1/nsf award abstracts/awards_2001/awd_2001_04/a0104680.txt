This three-year award for U.S.-Italian-Portuguese-Swiss
              cooperative research involves Anne Robertson of the University of Pittsburgh
              and Alfio Quarteroni of the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,
              Switzerland and Adelia Sequeira of the Instituto Superior Tecnico in Lisbon,
              Portugal.  Alessandro Veneziani of the Politecnico di Milano in Italy is a
              member of Professor Quarteroni's group and will also participate. The
              multinational and multidisciplinary team proposes to develop multiscale models
              of blood flow in the human vascular system. Specifically, they plan to evaluate
              multiscale models from the perspective of mathematics, numerical analysis, and
              physics/engineering.

The Italian group brings expertise in mathematical
              fluid mechanics for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids; the Swiss group will
              contribute expertise in finite and spectral element methods, numerical
              simulation of blood flow in human cardiovascular systems, fluid-structure
              interactions, and multiscale modeling; the PI has experience in continuum
              mechanics, including fluid mechanics and numerical simulation; and the
              Portuguese group is knowledgeable in mathematical analysis and numerical
              methods in fluid mechanics. The goal of the collaboration is to develop a more
              sophisticated numerical simulation tool, using a newer fluid dynamics model,
              that can be used for understanding and evaluating clinical treatment strategies
              for vascular disease.
