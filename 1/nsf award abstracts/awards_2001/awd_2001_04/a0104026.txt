This is a proposal for research in geometric group theory
focusing on
              Coxeter groups, Artin groups, and mapping class
groups of surfaces. The main
              problems to be addressed are the
following.
(1) For which Coxeter groups is
              the Coxeter diagram uniquely
determined by the group? For which Coxeter groups
              is the
fundamental generating set uniquely determined (up to
conjugation) by
              the group? For which Coxeter groups is the outer
automorphism group
              finite?
(2) Are all Artin groups linear groups?  
(3) Find a formula for the
              cohomology with compact supports of a
building. Likewise for the Salvetti
              complex of an Artin group.
(4) Determine the l^2 Betti numbers of cubical
              manifolds
associated to right-angled Coxeter groups. Do they vanish
              outside
the middle dimension? This would imply the Flag Complex
Conjecture
              concerning triangulations of odd-dimensional spheres
and has implications for
              graph embeddings.
(5) Develop a theory of mock reflection groups. This is a
              class of
groups similar to Coxeter groups which arise as transformations
of
              blow-ups of hyperplane arrangements.
(6) Is the Torelli subgroup of the
              mapping class groups of a
surface of genus at least three finitely
              generated?
(7) Can a word hyperbolic group be the fundamental group of
              a
surface by surface bundle? Must all finitely presented non word
hyperbolic
              groups contain a Baumslag-Solitar group or an abelian
group of rank
              two?

Group theory arises from the study of symmetries of an
object. When
              this object has an interesting geometric structure,
one can use geometric
              techniques to better understand the group
of symmetries. This project involves
              the study of certain
families of groups which arise in a broad range of
              mathematical
and physical contexts, such as the study of crystal
              structures
and the intertwining of DNA. These groups are associated to
              rich
and beautiful geometric structures which lend themselves to
              the
techniques of geometric group theory.
