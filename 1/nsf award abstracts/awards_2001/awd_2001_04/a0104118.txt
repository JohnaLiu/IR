Title: Microstructure and Symmetry Breaking
              Phase Transition: Analysis and Numerical Simulation


The goal of this
              project is to understand macroscopic properties of materials undergoing solid
              to solid phase transitions through modern methods in the calculus of
              variations. A main objective is to investigate the possible patterns that can
              form and their impact on the elastic behaviour of the material.

On the
              analytical side, virtually all methods to attack this problem are connected to
              the deep mathematical concept of quasiconvexity. Even 50 years after Morrey's
              seminal work, quasiconvexity is despite its fundamental importance still poorly
              understood, and any progress in this program will contribute to the unraveling
              of its mysteries.

The numerical simulation of microstructure poses a wealth
              of challenging problems. New insight into the underlying theoretical concepts
              will enhance the performance of algorithms and lead to their rigorous
              verification. Successful computations will help to develop new experiments that
              allow to identify optimal properties of materials.

The proposed integrated
              analytical and numerical approach is designed to advance the understanding and
              the optimization of new materials which play a crucial role in emerging
              technological applications, for example of microactuators based on shape memory
              materials or light guiding devices and bifocal contact lenses made of nematic
              elastomers.
