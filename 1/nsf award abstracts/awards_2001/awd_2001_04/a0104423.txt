Abstract    :
              This award is to hold an Industry/University planning meeting for a proposed
              research site at the University of Michigan which will be a part of the I/UCRC
              for Intelligent e-Maintenance Systems at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
               The planning meeting will examine the organizational feasibility and economic
              viability of the research site.  A portfolio of initial research projects will
              be determined.  New members will be recruited during the tenure of the award.
