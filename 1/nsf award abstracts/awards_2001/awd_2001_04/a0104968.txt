Abstract    :
              Evolutionary biologists and ecologists have long been fascinated by explosive
              radiations of species that exhibit tremendous morphological diversity and
              occupy a wide range of habitats. The flowering plant lineage Valerianaceae
              contains 300-350 species that have been placed in 14-17 genera, with nearly 200
              of the species being endemic to South America.  These species exhibit a
              striking range of floral and vegetative forms.  It has been hypothesized that
              the South American species represent a recent radiation. The availability of
              fossils will allow us to explicitly test biogeographic hypotheses and
              investigate rates of speciation within this group. The goals of this study are:
              1) to infer the phylogeny of Valerianaceae using several DNA sequence data
              sets, 2) to examine morphological character evolution, 3) to elucidate the
              biogeographic history of Valerianaceae, and 4) to assess rates of speciation,
              with an emphasis on the South American radiation.   

This will be the first
              phylogentic analysis of Valerianaceae to include a broad sample of species from
              each of the genera and will also provide an empirical application of several
              new methods for the study of rates of evolution and speciation.  Specifically
              we will test the hypothesis that over 200 species of Valerianaceae have
              originated since the formation of the Isthmus of Panama some 3-6 million years
              ago.  This project will compliment ongoing studies of other lineages of the
              Dipsacales and will enhance our understanding of Northern Hemisphere
              biogeography and the origin of the South American flora.  While our main aim is
              to address questions of broad evolutionary significance, there is an element of
              urgency to this research from the standpoint of conservation. Specifically, the
              enormous diversity now found in the Andes of South America is threatened by
              human impacts on the high elevation "paramo" vegetation.
