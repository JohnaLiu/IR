Abstract    :
              This grant supports theoretical research on the dynamics of physically adsorbed
              layers of atoms and molecules on solid surfaces.  The goal is to achieve a
              quantitative understanding of the interaction of atoms and molecules with
              surfaces in examples where the adsorbate and substrate are weakly modified by
              the interactions.  The work is a combination of analytically-based theory and
              computations which can be performed using work stations.  The topics include
              the analysis of the normal modes (phonons) of solid layers and of processes
              which contribute to the dissipation of energy initially in the layer, such as
              vibrational damping and sliding friction.
