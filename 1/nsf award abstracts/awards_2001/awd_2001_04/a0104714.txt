This U.S.-Brazil Program award will support Dr. L.E
              Scriven of the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities in a research collaboration
              with Eng. Marcio S. Carvalho, Eng. Paulo R. Souza-Mendes, and Eng. Luis F.
              Azevedo of the Pontifica Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC).  The
              primary objective is to document experimentally, explain theoretically, and
              reduce to computer code for process analysis, design and optimization two
              phenomena: 1. The film-splitting instabilities and generation of mist that
              limit productivity of roll-coaters, which are widespread in industry.  2. The
              breakdown of steady, coherent flow in fast slot-coating to form a thin liquid
              layer; this breakdown limits productivity of slot coaters, a common precision
              device in industry.

Liquid applied coating processes are an enabling
              technology in about 11% of total industrial production in the U.S., E.C. and
              Japan, and of increasing importance in advancing economies such as Brazil's. 
              This collaboration will combine the expertise of researchers at PUC in coating
              flows, polymer processing, and experimental technique in fluid mechanics with
              the expertise in coating processes at Minnesota, one of the leading centers in
              the country in this area.
