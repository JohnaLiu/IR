Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funding for an after-school field ecology research program. 
              The plan involves 20 teachers/student center staff and 500 urban students from
              under-served communities over a three-year period in a unique research project
              that links teachers and students.  The students will be divided into two
              cohorts:  14-16 years old and 17-18 years old.  The younger group (14-16) will
              conduct research led by teachers in riparian field ecology along urban rivers. 
              The older students (17-18) will be involoved in more in-depth projects where
              they are paired with a mentor from the state environmental agency.  The
              proposed program is designed to complete a four-year "pilot project" that was
              initiated at Boston College in 1999.  It is a partnership effort involving the
              Boston Public Schools, the Mayor's Office, state environmental agencies and a
              consortium of corporations.  Students collect, analyze and post data at the
              Boston College web site.  In addition to engaging in original research that is
              substantive and meaningful, students learn to use scientific instruments.  The
              goals of the program are to increase urban students' interest in science and in
              careers in science.
