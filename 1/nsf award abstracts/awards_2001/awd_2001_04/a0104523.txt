Abstract    :
              Recent observations on the "arrest of secretion response" (ASR) in yeast have
              documented a novel form of intracellular signaling: the protein which initiates
              the signal, although it is normally at the cell surface, must be trapped within
              intracellular compartments in order to signal. This project will explore
              molecular mechanisms which operate along this signaling pathway. In the ASR,
              inhibition of transport along the secretory path in sec mutants relocates
              proteins of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), inhibits nuclear import and also
              relocates nucleoplasmic proteins to the cytoplasm. Protein kinase C (Pkc1p) and
              two of the transmembrane proteins of the Wsc family are required for these
              events. They nevertheless do not require the Pkc1p MAP kinase cascade.
              Moreover, Wsc proteins trapped along the secretory path are required for
              signaling, as opposed to those which are normally at the plasma membrane. Thus,
              this work will determine 
* Whether Pkc1p associates with Wsc proteins and
              whether such association depends on whether an active ASR is occurring, 
*
              Whether diacylglycerol is generated when the secretory path is inhibited, i.e.
              during the ASR, 
* Whether a genetic screen can identify signaling
              intermediates which are required, especially those which function downstream of
              Pkc1p.
