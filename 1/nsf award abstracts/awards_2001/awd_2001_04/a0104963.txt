              DISSERTATION RESEARCH: The Genetic Basis of Adaptation in Thermally Adapted

This project will
              take a genomic approach to understanding of adaptation to high temperature. 
              The PIs will examine populations of Escherichia coli, a microbe present in the
              intestinal flora of all mammals, that have been cultured in the laboratory for
              2000 generations at high temperature.  They will examine the genetic basis of
              adaptation to high temperature, the degree of parallel evolution among
              different lines adapted to high temperature, and the reversability phenotypic
              and genetic changes upon exposure of populations to lower temperatures. The
              work addresses three main goals. The first goal is to examine how adaptation to
              high temperature changes the copy number of genes, either increasing copy
              number via duplication or decreasing copy number via deletion. The second goal
              is to examine how adaptation to temperature affects the level of gene
              expression. Lastly, given changing thermal conditions, how do organisms respond
              on the phenotypic or organismal level and how do they respond on the genetic
              level? Is there a particular pattern? Are changes at the organismal level
              always caused by the same genetic change, or can multiple genetic changes yield
              the same change in phenotype? 

DNA high-density arrays will be used to
              screen whole genomes for regions of gene duplication and deletion, and to
              characterize gene expression.  This whole genome approach is a powerful tool in
              that it allows the simultaneous screening of all 4290 E. coli genes, making
              individual examination of all 4290 genes unnecessary. This work is important
              because it begins to dissect the complex process of adaptation that has
              intrigued comparative and evolutionary biologists ever since the time of
              Darwin.
