Abstract    :
              The University of Minnesota is requesting funding to implement a nationwide
              citizen science project focused on the life cycle of monarch butterflies. 
              Scientists from the University will train naturalists and environmental
              educators throughout the U.S. at nine host sites.  Participants in the first
              round of training will then conduct regional training sessions for naturalists,
              who will in turn train volunteer monitors.  The target audience for volunteers
              will be adult/child teams.  Results  will be disseminated using the University
              of Minnesota's Environmental Spatial Analysis Center to show temporal and
              spatial data via the WWW.  Listserves will also be created to support the
              project, to augment a monthly newsletter and the website.  Mini-exhibits will
              be created to highlight the project at participating nature centers.  Exhibits
              will focus on monarch and insect ecology and conservation, as well as local and
              population-wide monitoring efforts.  It is estimated that 90-150 nature centers
              will participate in the regional training, and they will in turn train almost
              5,000 volunteers.
