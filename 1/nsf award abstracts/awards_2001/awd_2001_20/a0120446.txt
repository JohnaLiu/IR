Abstract    :
              Scientists have long recognized that reproduction is costly to females. Research
              in various species finds that sexually active females have shorter lives than
              virgin females. Recent studies, in fruit flies, have discovered toxic compounds
              in the seminal fluid of males that shorten the longevity of females after
              copulation. What the toxic compounds are doing and why they have evolved is a
              largely unresolved question. Previous experiments conducted in the fruit fly
              indicate that the mating frequency of parents affects the fitness of offspring.
              The goal of this project is to determine whether females exposed to toxic
              seminal fluid compounds have offspring with improved fitness. This project will
              compare the fitness of offspring from females that re-mate after holding them
              for one week 1) as virgins, 2) with males, 3) with genetically altered males
              that produce seminal fluid but not sperm, 4) with genetically altered males
              that do not produce seminal fluid or sperm.  
	
This study will help
              determine whether female reproductive costs occur to improve the quality of
              offspring. This work is important for our general understanding of maternal
              care, sexual and parent-offspring conflict, and for the evolution of
              reproductive strategies.
