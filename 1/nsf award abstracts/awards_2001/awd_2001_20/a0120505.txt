Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Croatian research project between Martin Saunders of Yale University
              and his partner, Olga Kronja of the University of Zagreb, examines the
              biological pathways important in the formation of steroids and triterpenoids. 
              The researchers seek new fundamental knowledge about the physical organic
              chemistry of carbocations, including protosteryl cation in animals and
              dammarenyl cation in plants.  These are to be investigated using both
              experimental techniques and quantum chemical calculations.

The US-Croatian
              team intends to determine the structural features specific for rearrangement of
              naturally occurring carbocation in biosynthesis.  To do so the researchers will
              investigate the following groups of model carbocations and their parent
              alcohols or chlorides: 1) the tert-amyl cation, 2) the methylated and
              deuterated derivatives of 2-cyclopenyl-e-propyl cation and 3) the carbocation
              derivatives of bicyclo[3.2.0]noname with various alkyl groups at C-1 and C-8.
              The research plan includes: (a) NMR spectroscopic studies on stable solutions
              of model carbocations and their isotopically labeled analogues in
              non-nucleophillic solution, (b) quantum chemical calculations with the model
              cation and natural cations themselves, and (c) analysis of the rearrangement
              processes of the model compound in aqueous or nonpolar solvents. Results should
              yield new insight into details of structure and rearrangements related to
              chemical behavior of the carbocations involved in biosynthesis of steroids.  If
              successful, this may have implications for future medical research designed to
              synthesize artificial hormones.

This project in organic dynamics of
              chemistry fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by
              enabling leading experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine
              complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
              competence.
