The objective of the proposed research is to test the
              hypothesis that a major fraction of dissolved organic matter in seawater occurs
              as self-assembled polymer gels with unique properties that differ from those of
              their constituent macromolecules or from rigid colloids of comparable size. 
              These properties affect bioavailability of the organic constituents in this
              colloidal matter.  The hypothesis will be tested in parallel laboratory and
              field experiments involving biophysics, biogeochemistry and marine
              microbiology.  The validity of the hypothesis is tested by addressing five
              subquestions which include: (1) What are the spatial and temporal distributions
              of the gel? (2) What are the chemical properties? (3) How are the physics of
              marine gels related to their sources and reactions? (4) What are the biological
              sources? (5) What biodegradation processes alter or remove the gels?  This
              research could help explain how organic polymer gels affect the function of the
              oceans microbial loop, and hence the marine food web and global carbon cycle.
