This grant will
              support preliminary explorations of the needs of statistical researchers and
              Federal statistical agencies to collaborate at a distance, using the Internet,
              over potentially confidential information.  Issues such as security, privacy
              and authenticated data arise, particularly when some of the collaborators are
              connected from behind Federal agency firewalls Data analysis, visualization,
              Internet-based teleconferencing and other collaboration tools will be explored,
              as will the applicability of new Internet protocols.
