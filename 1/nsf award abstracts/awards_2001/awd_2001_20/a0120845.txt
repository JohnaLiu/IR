Anadromous salmon are the life-blood of the Pacific
              Northwest, on which are based considerable economic, social, and cultural
              values. Normally, a massive quantity of organic material is transported from
              the ocean to streams annually via salmon migration. Presently, salmon stocks
              have declined, and lawmakers, resource managers, and the scientific community
              are beginning to ask what role salmon carcasses play in stream ecosystems.  The
              PIs will address this critical knowledge gap by tracing the flow of the heavy
              isotope of nitrogen (15N) added to an Alaskan stream before, during, and after
              a salmon carcass addition. This will quantify how the pulse of marine derived
              nutrients (MDN) alters rates of stream N cycling from both a food web and
              whole-stream perspective. This research builds on the insight gained from an
              ongoing USDA-funded study by using the 15N tracer technique in a novel way and
              will help to clarify the role MDN plays in stream ecosystems.
