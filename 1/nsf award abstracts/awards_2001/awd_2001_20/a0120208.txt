Abstract    :
                   The worldwide rate of extinctions of living species is near the highest
              level that has occurred since the asteroid collision of 65 million years ago. 
              Unlike that past natural event, present extinctions are mostly the direct or
              indirect results of human activities.  Massive modifications in habitats plus
              global climate changes are combining with comparably massive introductions of
              exotic species (some willful, but most inadvertent or accidental) to destroy
              naturally evolved native floras and faunas on all continents.

     Modern
              experimental biology is making a variety of important contributions to
              international efforts to at least slow, and in rare cases to halt, this
              destruction of major parts of the planet's biological environmental
              infrastructure.  To highlight some of the most important of these efforts, and
              to provide a lasting written record that might serve as the basis for
              additional work, the PI and a group of his associates are organizing an
              international conference devoted to these topics.  Primary sponsors for the
              conference are the UCLA Institute of the Environment and the International
              Commission on Comparative Physiology of the International Union of
              Physiological Sciences.  A major university press will subsequently publish a
              book summarizing the proceedings.

     The title of the conference is:
              EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES TO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY: The roles of experimental
              biology in the protection of endangered species and the control of exotic
              species.  It will take place on the campus of the University of California, Los
              Angeles (UCLA) from September 11-14, 2001.  The central portions of the
              conference will consist of three days of both invited and contributed papers,
              plus several panel and workshop discussions and poster sessions.  The first day
              will be devoted to endangered species, the second day to exotic species, and
              the third day to policy and regulatory issues.  Participants will be
              professionals active in the subject areas of the conference (including
              researchers, managers, and regulators) and interested students.  Information
              about the conference may be found at its website:
