Abstract    :
              This project is a three-day conference/workshop at Florida A&M University
              designed to develop strategies
and mechanisms to bring African American
              students from HBCUs into graduate programs leading to the PhD in the
              mathematical sciences.  The request is to support the HBCUs involved: Alabama
              A&M, Jackson State University, and South Carolina State University.

The
              conference responds to the NSF's Program Solicitation NSF 00-109 and is
              designed to "contribute to the Foundations effort to enlarge the science
              personnel of the nation by including students and recent doctoral
recipients,
              women, minorities..."  The goals of the conference are: To facilitate the
              transfer of mathematics students from the participating HBCUs to the
              participating majority institutions; to provide integrated student development
              and counseling oppportunities for the students participating in the program;
              and to institute linkages with industry and government which will provide
              intern and employment opportunities for the students involved.
