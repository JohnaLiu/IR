Abstract    :
              This award will establish a Center for Integrated Space Weather Modeling (CISM).
              The overall goal of CISM is to develop advanced computer models to specify and
              predict space weather from the surface of the sun to the surface of Earth.
              "Space Weather" is a term rapidly entering the common lexicon. It describes the
              ways in which the Sun, acting through the intervening space encompassing the
              solar wind, the magnetosphere, and the upper atmosphere, adversely affects the
              performance and reliability of space borne and ground based technological
              systems, or can endanger human life or health. CISM will focus on building a
              comprehensive, physics-based, numerical model that describes the environment
              from the Sun to the Earth, and can predict arrival time, intensity and duration
              of space storms. The Center will achieve three complementary goals:  1) it will
              do fundamentally new science, increasing our understanding of the complex, but
              closely coupled Sun-Earth system;  2) in partnership with other groups, it will
              convert the results of its research into robust and operationally useful
              forecasting tools to be used by both civilian and military space weather
              forecasters; and 3) it will educate the next generation of space scientists -
              taking advantage of the ability of space weather to capture imaginations
              through models and visualization tools. The principal knowledge transfer goal
              of CISM is to convert research results and models into robust operationally
              useful forecasting tools to be used by space weather forecasters and private
              industry. The most important legacy of the center will be improvements in the
              ability to respond to potential space weather hazards, thus protecting the
              nation's technological systems that are increasingly susceptible to conditions
              in the space environment.
