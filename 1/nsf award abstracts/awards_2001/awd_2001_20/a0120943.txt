Abstract    :
              This is a tie project between the Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center (I/UCRC) for Photopolymerization at the University of Colorado and the
              I/UCRC for Coatings at the University of Southern Mississippi.  The objectives
              of the research are to synthesize a series of novel thiol-ene monomers and
              study  their photopolymerization behavior under a variety of conditions.  The
              mechanisms and kinetics of photopolymerization will be investigated.  The
              fundamental knowledge about the structure-property relations will be used to
              develop stable photopolymers as industrial coatings.
