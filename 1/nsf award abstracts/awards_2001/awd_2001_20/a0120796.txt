Abstract    :
              The proposed Compact High Performance Cooling Technologies Research Center will
              address research and development needs of industries in the area of
              high-performance heat removal from compact spaces.  All product sectors in the
              electronics industry (high-performance, Cost/Performance, Telecommunications,
              Hand-held, Automotive, and Military/Avionics) face critical electronics cooling
              challenges, and the Center brings together an excellent team of faculty to
              address these needs.  Faculty participants in the proposed Center are from the
              Schools of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering and
              Aeronautics and Astronautics at Purdue University, and contribute complimentary
              competencies in heat transfer, microfluidics, microfabrication, mechatronics,
              controls, acoustics, sensing and actuation, diagnostics and measurements, and
              systems-level research.
