Abstract    :
              Symposium for ABS:"Behavior Genetics for the Next Decade:Beyond
              Heritability"
PI:  Christine Boake


This is a proposal for a symposium and
              related activities that are designed to educate behavioral biologists about the
              developing field that integrates behavior and biotechnology.  The symposium
              will be held at the annual meeting of the Animal Behavior Society in Corvallis,
              OR on 15 July 2001.  It is a follow-up to the workshop on integrating
              biotechnology and behavior that was held at NSF in August 2000.  The symposium
              was one of the major specific recommendations from the workshop.  The related
              activities are to publish the symposium proceedings as a special issue of the
              professional journal The American Naturalist, and to include in the special
              issue an introductory paper that discuss reasons to investigate the genetic
              architecture of behavioral traits.  The symposium speakers either attended at
              least one of the two biotechnology and behavior workshops, or are in the lab of
              a participant.  The topics of the symposium talks are (a) microarray analyses
              of the genetic basis of learning and memory, (b) the relationship between the
              major histocompatibiltiy complex and mating preferences in bird species, (c)
              the genetics of behavior in guppies, (d) the effects of gene interactions on
              animal behavior, (e) genetics and social interactions among kin, (f) genetic
              influences on maternal care, (g) molecular genetics and social behavior, and
              (h) neurogenetics of fruitfly behavior.  These topics were chosen in order to
              show the listeners the sophisticated genetic techniques can be applied to a
              great breadth of species and many kinds of behavior.
