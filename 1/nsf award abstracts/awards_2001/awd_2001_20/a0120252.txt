Abstract    :
              Chief objectives of this international workshop are:  sharing of latest research
              results on product sound quality, noise engineering, and human factors and
              psychoacoustics; understanding industry's current practices and future needs;
              defining joint research projects that will improve understanding of how people
              perceive and are affected by the complex sounds produced by machinery; and
              exploring mechanisms by which that understanding can be put to good use by
              practicing engineers.  The forum will provide a unique opportunity for a closer
              interaction between leading U.S. academics and industry parctitioners and
              experts from Western Europe, Japan and Korea. The 3-day symposium activities
              will be supplemented with a 2-day visit to several industry facilities
              including two new automaotive company Noise-Vibration-Harshness (NVH)
              facitities which are engage in extensive activities in sound quality.  Summary
              reports on the PSQ '01 workshop based on both workshop proceedings and those
              projects sparked by the workshop will be presented at meetings of the
              Acoustical Society and the Institute of Noise Control Engineering.  This
              symposium intends to identify common international interests and priorities in
              the area of noise and product sound quality and focus on important relevant
              scientific issues
