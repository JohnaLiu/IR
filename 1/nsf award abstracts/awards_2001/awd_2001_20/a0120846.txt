Physical characterizing of the suspended particles in liquid is
              required for many particulate processing systems such as applications in
              pharmaceutical, chemical, oil, and other industries.  Dynamic light scattering
              has been successfully used in the laboratory with limited success in industrial
              processes involving particulate transport.  Although for single scattered
              light, the particle size can be accurately determined.  However, multiple
              scattering occurring in suspension transport prevents accurate particle size or
              velocity measurements.

To resolve this problem, previous efforts have been
              focused on development of correlation theories in multiple scattered problem
              with limited success.  A novel approach is proposed here where the signals from
              two detectors with small but finite angular separation are cross-correlated to
              detect only the single scattered speckle patter.  This method is proposed in
              combination of 'flow suppression' technique where the scattered wave vector
              perpendicular to the flow direction is used to avoid the disturbance due to the
              fluid velocity, allowing more accurate measurement of the particle size in a
              flowing suspension.  The preliminary results for submicron particles at low
              velocities show some potential.
