Abstract    :
              Snowmass 2001 will consider experiments at the highest energies, experiments of
              exceptional sensitivity, and experiments that explore very high scales through
              virtual effects; accelerators to address a broad range of scientific
              opportunities; accelerator research to provide information for knowledgeable
              decisions about future projects, and accelerator   research and technology
              development for the long term; theory that   develops hand-in-hand with
              experiment and visionary theory that   hasn't yet engaged experimental particle
              physics directly. The workshop will examine accelerator experiments as well as
              astroparticle, particle astrophysics, and cosmological studies that use natural
              sources. It will examine the interplay between particle physics and new
              technologies, and will explore the interactions between particle physics and
              related fields. 
     Snowmass 2001 will be a forum for the critical
              examination of future projects, and will provide crucial community input to the
              long-range planning activities undertaken by the science funding agencies and
              the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel. It will be an ideal place for a broad
              community of scientists to examine initiatives for new accelerators and new
              detectors that are being developed throughout the world.
	The entire request
              is for funds for education and outreach activities and to subsidize the
              attendance of students and post-doctoral associates who would otherwise be
