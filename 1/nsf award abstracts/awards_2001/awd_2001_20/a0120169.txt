Abstract    :
              Soil food webs are complex assemblages of diverse species that couple mineral
              nutrient cycles in the soil to primary productivity of plants in root-zone
              ecosystems known as rhizospheres.  These interactions link carbon from plant
              root exudates to a variety of predator-prey relationships that return excess
              nitrogen through mineralization to the growing plant.  Previous work shows that
              the presence of predators in the rhizosphere food web can increase plant growth
              50 to 150%.  This project will use mass-isotope and molecular genetic
              techniques to identify processes involved in regulating these interactions. 
              Work will be guided by a hierarchical mathematical model designed to predict
              how increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide and temperature influence carbon
              storage in the rhizosphere.  Linkages between the carbon and nitrogen cycles in
              soil will be clarified by experiments under different levels of atmospheric
              carbon dioxide and temperature that move the ecosystem to new equilibria.  One
              importance of this project lies in its contribution to the debate over whether
              additional carbon from increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide can be
              stored in soil.  Other aspects of the work will identify mechanisms that
              promote plant growth while sustaining beneficial interactions among bacteria,
              nematodes and mites that prey on nematodes.
