Abstract    :
              The workshop will be convened to address the issues raised in the recent report
              from the National Research Council, Grand Challenges in the Environmental
              Sciences, concerning the use of materials.  The objective of the workshop is to
              recommend a research agenda needed to reinvent the use of materials. Topics
              will include material budgets and cycles, their resource and environmental
              implications, the next generation of products and materials, optimization of
              material cycles, and scenarios for the future use of materials. Participants
              will include research scientists in academia, industry, and relevant
              agencies.

The expected outcomes will include a 5-year plan for the
              implementation of an initial detailed research program, a strategy for
              developing the necessary research integration across the disciplines, a program
              for training individuals in the topical area of materials use, and a strategy
              for coordinating the program results with those of the other grand challenge
              initiatives.
