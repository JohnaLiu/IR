Title:   Stretching Horizons: 
              Upward Bound Programs in Stimulating Information Technology Education and
              Career Aspirations among Underrepresented Minorities  

This proposal
              provides support for California Lutheran University to conduct a research
              project to examine why so few male and female African American and Latino
              students are studying computer science at the college level.  The three
              cohorts, Upward Bound students, Math Upward Bound students and non-Upward Bound
              students, will be studied as to their experiences, opportunities, attitudes and
              aspirations with respect to information technology (the federally-funded Upward
              Bound program is made up of two different programs, the traditional Upward
              Bound program and the Math/Science Upward Bound program).  The sites of the
              study are schools in the three-county Southern California region IX of Upward
              Bound, Los Angeles, Ventura and Orange Counties.
