Abstract    :
              This proposalwill design, build, test, and evaluate a long base line navigation
              system that can serve several deep-ocean vehicles simultaneously. Current
              transponder based navigation methods for use in underwater vehicles such as
              Alvin, Jason, and ABE can only serve one vehicle at a time. The work proposed
              will augment standard transponders to include a precision clock and control
              circuits so that the transponders may be operated as accurately timed beacons.
              This will enable any number of vehicles to calculate their position using data
              obtained from passive tracking. The proposed system will improve productivity
              in the conventional expeditionary mode as well as enabling multiple vehicle
              navigation as part of a seafloor observatory network. To ensure a smooth
              transition with present operations, the PI's propose to retain conventional
              transponder capabilities on the beacons. Thus, a deployed net will always
              remain able to operate in the current transponder mode if only one vehicle is
              in use.
