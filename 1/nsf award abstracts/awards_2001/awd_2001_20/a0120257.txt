Abstract    :
              A recent analysis of data acquired viewing the Earth limb edge-on from the space
              shuttle has demonstrated that the present model of the nightglow emission is
              incomplete.  The observations were made by the Arizona Airglow Experiment
              (GLO).  It uses a new technique referred to as "hyperspectral imaging" in which
              vertical profiles of all of the prominent nightglow emissions are recorded
              simultaneously.

This proposal requests support to continue the analysis of
              archival data with the main purpose of providing a more appropriate nightglow
              model.  A review of all present model parameters will be undertaken.  That will
              be followed by static and finally dynamic representations of nightglow
              condition.  The GLO data archive is extensive.  Many conditions have been
              observed that will be used to constrain the model process.
