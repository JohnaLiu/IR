Abstract    :
              
The proposed center's goal is to develop state of the art techniques for micro
              and nanoscale contamination control, removal and characterization in
              manufacturing and fabrication processes.  The center will contribute to the
              competitiveness of the semiconductor, information technology, pharmaceutical,
              imaging, aerospace and other industries affected by particulate and ionic
              contamination.  The center will especially focus on surface cleaning of
              patterned, structured and flat substrates.  Faculty in the center have
              identified mechanisms to effectively clean ionic contamination from patterned
              wafers.
