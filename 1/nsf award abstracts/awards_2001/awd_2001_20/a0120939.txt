Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to develop new query evaluation and
              optimization techniques for processing relational queries in main-memory
              databases. Recent improvements in main memory size and cost suggest that large
              classes of applications may obtain the performance benefits of having the data
              in main memory. The project focuses on issues in computer architecture that
              influence main memory performance, including cache miss latency and branch
              misprediction penalties. Algorithms for database operations will be developed
              that are sensitive to these and other issues, and thus perform well on modern
              architectures. Broader questions such as how to design a comprehensive
              architecture-sensitive query processing framework will be studied. The
              algorithms and techniques resulting from this project could have application in
              commercial and experimental database systems, where they could improve the
              speed of query processing. Results from the project will be disseminated as
              research papers and as freely available prototype software.
