Evolution has long served to unify the study of biology, but
              it has now acquired a more central role. Today evolution informs and directs
              data acquisition, analysis and interpretation in all of the life sciences. This
              transformation comes in part from the explosion of raw data, from sources as
              far-ranging as genome sequences, adaptive physiology, population genetics,
              long-term behavioral studies, developmental mechanisms, ecological genetics,
              large-scale ecosystem studies, functional genomics, and phylogenetics. Such
              data can only be interpreted and synthesized using highly developed database
              management and analysis tools and requires the comparative tools of evolution.
              There is no institution dedicated to the consolidation, synthesis and
              dissemination of this broad sweep of evolutionarily relevant information.
              Therefore the goal of the proposed workshop is to discuss the need for an
              evolutionary synthesis center, as well as the practical, data-related
              capacities required for such a center. A center for evolutionary synthesis
              would serve the needs of the evolutionary biology community by providing
              mechanisms to foster collaborative, cross-disciplinary synthesis of  existing
              and newly-produced datasets. The center would also play a critical role in the
              further unification of the biological sciences as it draws together knowledge
              from disparate fields to increase our general understanding of biological form
              and function. Finally, the center would also play a valuable role in organizing
              and synthesizing evolutionary knowledge that will inform non-academics, for
              example, in areas of applied evolution such as infectious disease, drug design,
              and bioremediation.
