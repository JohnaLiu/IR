Abstract    :
              This planning grant proposal presents information supporting a multi-university,
              multi-disciplinary Center for Engineering Logistics and Distribution (CELDi). 
              The proposed center will be a National Science Foundation sponsored
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC).  The vision for the
              center is to provide integrated solutions to logistics problems, through
              modeling, analysis and intelligent-systems technologies, building upon the
              knowledge and expertise available at the three member campuses, the University
              of Arkansas, the University of Oklahoma, and the University of Louisville.
