Abstract    :
              The research focus of the NSF I/UCRC for Membrane Applied Science and Technology
              (MAST) is membranes, microporous films, and barrier layers.  Membranes are
              permable films that permit separation or the controlled release of solutes. 
              They are used for water desalination, wastewater treatment, artificial kidneys,
              and in the controlled release of pharmaceuticals, flavors, cosmetics,
              inscticides, and herbicides.  Microporous films are used in breathable fabrics,
              surgical dressings, artificial lungs, batteries, and fuel cells.  Barrier
              layers are used in breathable contact lenses, food packaging, water barriers,
              and protective coatings.  Membranes offer exceptional potential for smart
              sensor and bioMEMS technologies since tey are the only separations technology
              that will work on the microscale.  This Center will expand the MAST Center to a
              Multi-University I/UCRC.
