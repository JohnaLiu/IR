This award supports the participation of American
              scientists in a U.S.-Korea seminar on information technology for product
              development to be held in Bokwang, Korea in July 2001.  The co-organizers are
              Professor Richard Crawford of the University of Texas at Austin and Professor
              Yong Se Kim of Sungkyunkwan University in Korea.  Information technology has
              revolutionized the entire product development design cycle, and will continue
              to do so.  The seminar will enable U.S. and Korean researchers and graduate
              students to exchange the latest research findings in the areas of
              Internet-aided distributed design, virtual systems and environment, enterprise
              integration and product data management, solid freeform fabrication, and
              computer-aided process planning.

The objectives of the seminar and
              associated activities are to 1) exchange information on recent advances; 2)
              visit Korean laboratories to gain an understanding of available expertise and
              facilities; 3) identify research areas that are particularly suited for
              U.S.-Korea collaboration; and 4) introduce American graduate students to
              research opportunities in Korea.  The exchange of ideas and data with Korean
              experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work,
              and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Seminar organizers
              have made a special effort to involve students.  Findings of the meeting will
              be publicized via professional journals and conferences.
