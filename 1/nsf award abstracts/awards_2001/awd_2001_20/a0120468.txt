Abstract    :
              This project will characterize and quantify the feedback mechanisms among
              terrestrial ecosystems, the climatic system, and air pollution involving cycles
              of water, energy, and various chemical species. A coupled model that links
              dynamic terrestrial hydrology and ecology, physical climate (atmosphere and
              ocean), and atmospheric chemistry will be developed that also, and perhaps,
              uniquely, includes two-way linkages with land-use change and emissions
              prediction and policy. The model will be used to quantify the combined effects
              of air pollution and climate change on the productivity and distribution of
              vegetation globally. Recognizing the large uncertainties in various feedback
              processes, the principal investigators (PIs), Drs. Prinn and Melillo, will
              undertake a comprehensive analysis of the sensitivity of their conclusions, and
              provide probability distributions for the key model output variables. The PIs
              expect this research to provide significant information for understanding how
              our future global environment will evolve under the joint effects of growing
              world population, changing technological and agricultural practices, and
              economic development. 

This project is being supported through the
              Biocomplexity in the Environment: Coupled Biogeochemical Cycles Research
              Program.
