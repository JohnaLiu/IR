Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to improve the chemical characterization of
              polar organic compounds within the lower troposphere.  Polar organic compounds
              contribute to degradation in air quality and may be associated with the adverse
              health impacts of air pollution.  The project includes the development of a
              relatively new instrument configuration to identify polar organic material by
              combining Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry with Atmospheric Pressure
              Electrospray Ionization Analysis.  Protocols will be developed for extracting
              polar organic compounds from fine particulate samples into aqueous solutions
              and using high-pressure liquid chromatography for separating complex mixtures
              containing polar organic compounds before introducing them into the instrument.
               A searchable library of polar organic compounds will be generated using
              prepared standards that are analyzed by this technique.
