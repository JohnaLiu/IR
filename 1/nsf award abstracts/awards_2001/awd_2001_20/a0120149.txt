Abstract    :
              This SGER award has the following objectives:

(i) To upgrade the radiation
              scheme to include improved treatments of radiative transfer and
              parameterizations of optical properties; and
(ii) To provide expanded
              capabilities including the ability to provide radiances, fluxes,
              photo-synthetically active radiation (PAR) and other quantities required of
              other modules of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). 

The work is
              important because it will lead to flexible tools to allow either the existing
              CCSM radiation code or the new code to be used for future work on simulated
              satellite radiances, actinic fluxes and other parameters of broad interest to
              the community.
