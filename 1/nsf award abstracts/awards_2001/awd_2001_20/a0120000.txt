Abstract    :
              This is a one-year planning activity to develop a collaborative working
              relationship among 
research groups at the Georgia Institute of Technology,
              Louisiana State University, the 
Environmental Protection Agency, and SRI
              International.  The objective is the development and 
demonstration of a
              jet-REMPI (resonantly enhanced multiphoton ionization) instrument for
              
analyzing combustion byproduct emissions that are environmental hazards such
              as dioxins, 
furans, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  Current
              methods of analysis for these 
chemicals in the different and disparate
              research studies at LSU, GIT, and EPA are very time 
consuming, requiring up
              to a month for a single analysis.  In contrast, SRI's jet-REMPI device 
can
              analyze low levels of simple chlorinated hydrocarbons in seconds.  Adaptation
              of this 
technique to the research environment will remove a major impediment
              to progress in several 
areas of environmental chemistry.
