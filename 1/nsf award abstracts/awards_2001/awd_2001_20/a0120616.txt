The purposes of this planning grant are: (1) to bring
              together a group of scientists with various specialties, from several
              universities, who have been studying salt marshes in the vicinity of the Hudson
              River estuary; and (2) to allow this group to interact with a group of
              scientists at Florida State University who are studying salt marshes in
              Florida.  We wish to develop a proposal, to be submitted a year from now to
              NSF's Biocomplexity program, that will integrate our various skills and
              interests to explore the biocomplexity of these systems and the effects of
              urban anthropogenic stress upon it.  We will develop a program using new
              mathematical approaches to analyze the connectivity of components of the
              marshes, and also the nature of inherent space and time scales in these
              systems.  Regarding time scales, we will develop a research program to detect
              the existence of nonlinear, chaotic phenomena.  The locations of the New York
              area marshes to be studied are: (1) the New York shore of the Arthur Kill, in
              Staten Island, highly impacted by oil pollution; (2) the Meadowlands of New
              Jersey, with high levels of mercury and other heavy metals; (3) Tuckerton, in
              Southern New Jersey, relatively unimpacted by anthropogenic sources.  The group
              will hold several workshops at the Meadowland Environmental Research
              lnstitute's environmental center to which the FSU scientists will be invited,
              and will also participate in workshops held at FSU.  At these workshops we will
              plan the scope and operational details of an eventual full scale research
              proposal.
