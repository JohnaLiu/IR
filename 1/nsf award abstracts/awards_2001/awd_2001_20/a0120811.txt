Abstract    :
              The Semantic Web is a vision: the idea of having data on the Web defined and
              linked in a way that it can be used by computers not just for display purposes,
              but for automation, integration and reuse of data across various applications.
              The goal of the International Semantic Web Working Symposium (SWWS) (July
              30-August 1, Stanford, California) is to bring together researchers and
              practitioners (1) to present the state-of-the-art in the development of the
              Semantic Web; (2) to examine the research issues that relate to the different
              components of what constitutes the Semantic Web technology; (3) to
              cross-fertilize ideas on the development of Semantic Web information systems
              among different domains. SWWS is both the first workshop on this topic in North
              America and the first one sponsored or in corporation with three major funding
              agencies from the U.S. and from Europe, namely NSF, DARPA, and the European
              Commission. It also has strong ties with the W3C Semantic Web Activity. The
              expected outcome of the workshop is a better common knowledge and synergy for
              those wishing to develop new exciting basic technology and applications for the
              Semantic Web. It should guide the future cooperation for enabling future
              standards to be adopted worldwide. A written report will be produced following
              the workshop, summarizing the main conclusions and research directions to
              follow, which will be published at http://www.semanticweb.org/SWWS/. We expect
              that this workshop and the follow-up report can serve as guidance for future
              international collaboration in research projects on the Semantic Web topic.
