Abstract    :
              The Multi-university Center for Dielectrics will target research in three focal
              areas:  evolutionary, revolutionary, and basic.  Evolutionary topics will
              emphasize near-term industrial needs such as dielectric degradation mechanisms,
              which affect component reliability.  Revolutionary research involves a paradigm
              shift in the industry.  For example, nanoparticle deposition by electrophoresis
              will produce new capacitor structures with submicron layers.  Basic topics will
              permit in-depth investigation of defect chemistry and microwave dielectric
              relaxation mechanisms which opens new research areas in pulse power and
              wireless components.
