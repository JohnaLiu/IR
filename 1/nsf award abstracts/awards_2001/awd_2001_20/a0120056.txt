Title:   Getting the Media Message:  The
              Portrayal of Gender, Race, and Information Technology in the Media Environment
              of Middle School Students.  

This award provides support for a study
              examining media messages about Information Technology (IT) careers that middle
              school students receive from television, popular magazines, videotapes, movies,
              and from books, brochures and Internet sites that provide career information.
              The analysis will concentrate on the media portrayal of IT occupations,
              especially in terms of gender and race, that students are likely to encounter
              during the middle school years.  Sixth and Seventh grade students in 12
              demographically diverse classrooms across the nation will participate in
              classroom-based action research employing mathematics, language arts, and
              social science skills in surveying their peers and conducting their own content
              analysis of media messages about IT careers.
