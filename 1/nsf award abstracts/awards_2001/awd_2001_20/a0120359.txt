Abstract    :
              A Bayesian statistical approach and size-exclusion DNA microarray
              experimentation, which complement each other, will be developed to achieve the
              complete mapping of operons. With the precise operon structures determined, the
              regulational analysis can accurately address the regulation on each mRNA
              species.   This project addresses the fundamental issue of deducing regulatory
              circuitry at the genomic scale. It is one of the early attempts for combining
              prior mechanistic knowledge with large amounts of DNA microarray data. The
              project also attempts to represent the genome-wide regulation features by a
              smaller subset of regulatory proteins.
