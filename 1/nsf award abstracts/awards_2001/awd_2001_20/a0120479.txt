Abstract    :
              This proposal discusses the planning phase of a proposed I/UCRC Research Site of
              the Ohio State University Center for Advanced Polymer and Composite Engineering
              (CAPCE) at FAMU-FSU College of Engineering.  CAPCE is an existing, successful
              I/UCRC.  The proposed Florida Research Site compliments CAPCE by bringing to
              the joint I/UCRC (1) strong partners in the aerospace and construction
              industries as well as federal labs, and (2) additional capabilities in
              composite process design, modeling and simulation, and advanced material
              testing and characterization.  This is in addition to conducting advanced
              polymer and composite materials research and manufacturing technology research
              similar to CAPCE's research focus.
