Abstract    :
              This effort will develop the computational tools that will enable the
              integrative analysis of the multi-genetic functions that metabolic maps
              represent.  Transcriptional regulatory events will be represented by applying
              time-dependent Boolean constraints. With this description one can potentially
              interpret, analyze, and predict the effects of transcriptional regulation on
              cellular metabolism. Additionally, it is proposed to extract how different
              regulatory mechanisms can drive the solution to the edges of a solution space,
              where optimal solutions are calculated and where experimental data is
              available.  Overall, integrating metabolic fluxes with the Boolean
              representation of regulatory structures will lead to the broadening of
              genome-scale models of microbes, by which optimal growth and metabolic
              secretion patterns are represented.  Several graduate students will acquire
              cross-training in computation, life science, biochemical engineering, and
              biotechnology.
