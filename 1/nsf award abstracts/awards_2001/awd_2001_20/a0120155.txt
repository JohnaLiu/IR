SGER:  Application-Oriented
              Object Architecture

ABSTRACT

This SGER project studies the feasibility of
              an application-oriented object architecture (AOA) to revolutionize the way
              computer systems are built and drastically reduce the problems of obsolescence
              and reengineering.  The proposed 2-layer architecture consists of an
              application unit (AU) and an application object (AO).  The two form a
              substrate-software pair with all software functionality in the AO: no
              additional software is needed and the AU is optimized for the particular AO. 
              This architecture is demonstrated by using an existing computer system such as
              a desktop and a commonly used resume document application, using a simulation
              environment prototype for the AU. The work is exploratory in nature and intends
              to lay the groundwork for a more substantial project. The project intends to
              make significant contributions to computer systems development and redefine the
              roles of traditional software, hardware, and applications, providing a new
              foundation for computer systems based on applications instead of environments.
