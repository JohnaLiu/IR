Abstract    :
              The secretion of heterologous proteins that contain disulfide bonds is not at
              its full potential.  Evidence suggests that the regulation of the redox state
              of the endoplasmic reticulum may be a bottleneck.  A multifaceted approach is
              proposed to probe and manage the redox state in yeast in order to investigate
              the bottleneck hypothesis further and to ultimately increase secretion
              efficiency.  The four elements of the proposed work are: (1) amplify the
              products of the individual genes now thought to be involved redox management to
              assess the effect, (2) use display methods to uncover possibly missing pathway
              elements, (3) add redox altering compounds to the growth medium to alter redox
              state, and (4) develop a tachyplesin I substrate-based diagnostic system.
