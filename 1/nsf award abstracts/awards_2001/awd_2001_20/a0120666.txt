Abstract    :
              This project features seven interrelated activities designed to advance
              community college leadership in science, mathematics, engineering, and
              technology (SMET) education, to encourage the development of ATE-related
              programs in more community colleges, and to share information about the value,
              accomplishments, and community impact of the ATE program in and beyond the
              education field. The activities build upon the successes of AACC's previous
              efforts supported by the National Science Foundation. They support the network
              of community colleges dedicated to improving SMET education, and help to expand
              and focus the future of the ATE program as it positions itself to meet the
              challenges presented by a new century and an increasing demand for a trained
              technical workforce. 

There is activity in seven areas:
* Three National
              ATE Principal Investigators Conferences in 2002, 2003, and 2004,
* Development
              of an ATE Leadership Program to include three ATE Centers Meetings, three ATE
              Presidents Meetings, and a Summit on Technological Education that combines
              community college and business representatives to develop strategies to
              strengthen the nation's technical workforce and faculty pipeline,
*
              Continuation of the AACC ATE Mentoring Program to help ten community colleges
              establish new programs in science, mathematics, engineering, and/or
              technology,
* Two AACC Briefs, one focusing on the outcomes of the ATE
              Mentoring Program, and one focusing on impact and results of the ATE PI
              Conference.
* A summary of recommendations and findings from the Summit on
              Technological Education,
* Dissemination of information about ATE programs and
              goals through AACC publications, presentations, feature stories, conference
              proceedings, a listserv, and a Web page, and
* Evaluation.
