Abstract    :
              The objective of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center is to
              establish a leading edge Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Technology and Innovation Management (CTIM), challenge and advance the field of
              technology and innovation management with emphasis on creation and analysis of
              concepts, tools and processes.  The Center will leverage and apply the unusual
              industry-academic partnership of the Northwestern University and the MATI - a
              consortium of 17 multi-billion dollar, multinational, technology-intensive
              firms and the central node in a domestic and international network of other
              industry-academic collaborations.

This Center will contribute to the
              practical knowledge and application of technology and innovation management. 
              Practice-driven, CTIM will constantly interact with domestic and global firms
              and institutions.  This link will highlight fertile and important topics and
              provide a dynamic laboratory for research and review of Center output. 
              Membership will consist of actively participating industrial, consulting, legal
              and other firms and affiliates.
