This award will support Drs. Paul D. Fullagar  and Timothy
              J. Bralower, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in collaboration with
              Maria Lorente,  and Eglee J. Zapata, Universidad Central de Venezuela, for a
              study to determine the strontium- and carbon-isotope stratigraphy for La Luna
              Formation, a major source of  petroleum in Venezuela.  The proposal plans to
              provide a chemostratigraphy framework (based on strontium and carbon isotopes)
              that would allow correlation of La Luna Formation sections in Venezuela, and
              thus a better understanding of  its environment of deposition and the
              accumulation of these organic carbon-rich deposits.   

 This stratigraphy 
              will be an integral part of a nearly completed
              biostratigraphic-chemostratigraphic age model for the formation.  The
              investigation will enhance our understanding of the processes that control the
              accumulation of marine Cretaceous organic carbon-rich sediments (CORG) known as
              "black shales" deposits throughout earth history.
