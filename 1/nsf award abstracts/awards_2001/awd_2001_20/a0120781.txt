Abstract    :
              This study investigates the impact of interpersonal and interorganizational
              networks on the formation of high technology strategic alliances in two
              countries: the United States and Israel. The project significantly expands the
              purview of prior work, making use of a model recognizing that different
              exchanges create two types of relationships - interpersonal and
              interorganizational - which represent the starting points for network formation
              processes reported by Doz, Olk & Ring (2000). This study extends that research
              by examining the relevance of variations in interpersonal and organizational
              networks for strategic alliance development, examining organizational
              relationships in terms of prior and current relationships; and interpersonal
              relationships both in terms of formal, role-based relationships and informal
              friendship ties, and their relationship with strategic alliance
              characteristics. The study will control for the influence of the alliance's
              technology, the strategic interests and organizational characteristics of the
              partners and the institutional settings, while examining these networks'
              relationship to the performance of the strategic alliance.
The study focuses
              on two of the world's extremely high-growth high technology communities of
              similar size and growth rates, Colorado and Israel, taking advantage of the
              formation of some 40 strategic alliances in the immediate vicinity of two
              institutions - the University of Denver and the Technion - with relationships
              to the communities. It is anticipated that this study will be the first, pilot
              stage of an eventual multi-stage project.
