Obtaining a suitable tracer that can estimate lateral
              mixing of shelf waters into the open ocean or can determine the intensity of
              upwelling in response to ENSO forcing has been hindered by (1) the timescale of
              these processes (decadal), (2) the fact that simple mixing of radioisotopes
              with older water masses can result in an aging artifact, and (3) the effects of
              multiple endmembers.  Based on some preliminary results, a PI from the
              University of South Carolina-Columbia has demonstrated that the activity ratio
              of 228Ra/227Ac shows great promise as a tracer of lateral mixing processes in
              the ocean.  Because this proposed application is so novel, the PI will use SGER
              funds to improve the analytical technique for determining these radionuclides
              and the parent isotopes, as well as carry out additional field tests to verify
              the utility of this approach.  The PI also plans to develop an in-line
              cartridge system that can be installed on ships of opportunity thereby
              increasing the spatial distribution of ex228Ra/ex227Ac activity ratios of
              surface waters to determine the stability of lateral mixing rates on timescales
              of years to decades.
