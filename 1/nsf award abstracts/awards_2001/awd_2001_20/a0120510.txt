              ABSTRACT

Workshop: Computational Approaches to Theoretical
              Morphology

Increased
              computer graphics capability and new software tools has facilitated the
              development of new approaches to Theoretical Morphology, the analysis of
              potential morphologies of groups of organisms independent of the morphologies
              which are known from today or from the fossil record. This workshop will bring
              together computer scientists, paleontologists and biologists to develop new
              theoretical morphological models.  The focus of the workshop will be to further
              develop a mathematical model and associated computer simulation of the
              multi-plate sea urchin skeleton.  The wealth of paleontological, evolutionary
              and developmental information about sea urchins makes this an excellent choice
              for such a model.  Moreover, sea urchin growth involves multiple plates in a
              close-packing configuration, which is also true of a number of other groups. 
              At this workshop we will further develop this sea urchin morphometric model,
              consider several, alternative, previously developed models, and consider
              initial tests of the model.
