Proposal Number: 0120234


The aim of the proposed
              work is to combine molecular genetics with computational analysis to map the
              signal transduction pathways in eucaryotic cells.  Of special interest is the
              topology/connectivity of the metabolic pathways.  The initial system will be
              the Ras and Tor signaling pathways in Saccahromyces cerevisiae.  Data for whole
              genome expression will be used to develop and validate pathway maps.
