Abstract    :
              This 1-year empirical pilot study will investigate the reasons for the
              under-representation women majoring in Information Technology(IT) related
              disciplines in institutions of higher education.  The study will focus on two
              questions:  1) Why do women who have the potential to succeed in the study of
              IT disciplines, take alternative educational paths?  2) What barriers and
              obstacles must be overcome to attract more women to IT education and careers?
