This award will support a
              design study for a 6000+ Meter human occupied submersible for the National Deep
              Submergence Facility (DSF) operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and
              dedicated to support ocean science research.  The Ship Acquisition and Upgrade
              Program provides funds for ship constructions, upgrades, acquisitions, and
              design studies. 

This project will allow the PI to begin a conceptual design
              study for a deep submergence vehicle that may eventually replace the aging deep
              submergence vehicle (DSV) Alvin.  A submersible capable of operating to depths
              greater than 6000 meters would provide US scientists access to an additional
              35% of the ocean floor to carryout studies pertaining to biodiversity, biomass,
              and processes at work on the abyssal plain and in deep sea trenches.  The study
              will include a detailed evaluation of new technology and hardware options. 
              Other countries, such as France, Japan, and Russia, already have manned
              submersibles capable of operating to this depth.

The Project Director,
              Barrie Walden is fully qualified to direct this project having had considerable
              experience in supervising the DSV Alvin, and other submersibles through his
              management of the DSF. ***
