              word abstract by Gautam Dasgupta, Columbia University

After a productive
              International Conference on Theoretical, Applied,
Computational and
              Experimental Mechanics efforts are made to invite US  researchers  from 
              Civil,
Mechanical, Aerospace, Bio and Environmental Engineering at the
              ICTACEM
12/01 and post conference symposia in IIT Madras and Delhi. The focus
              is 
on new technology, mechanics education/research  and future joint
              NSF
proposals with  Indian researchers. Only 50%  air fare is requested for
              three female and seven male
participants: four chair professors, two full
              professors, two associateprofessors, and two PhD students. 
A modest sum to 
              disseminate proceedings (printed/CD
and free web download) is included.
