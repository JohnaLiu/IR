A grant has been awarded to an interdisciplinary team of
              researchers  from Duke University, University of Maryland, University of
              Maryland  Biotechnology Institute, North Carolina State University, and the 
              Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. This grant will support  the
              largest effort to date to solve the major questions in the  evolution of the
              arthropods.  The arthropods --  which include  insects, shrimp, centipedes,
              horshoe crabs, spiders and ticks --  represent more species than the rest of
              the animals combined.  Despite more than a decade of molecular work, the
              relationships of  these major groups of arthropods are not known. This grant
              will use  information from the three completely sequenced animal genomes 
              (human, worm, and fly) to help us obtain a giant dataset of nuclear  protein
              coding sequences from 85 representative arthropod species.  This dataset will
              include approximately 50,000 base pairs of DNA  sequences per species, which is
              more than 10 times larger than the  largest existing dataset.

This project
              will not only decide the  relationships of the major groups of arthropods, but
              will tell us  which group of marine crustaceans (shrimps , lobsters and crabs)
              are  the closest relatives to the insects, which represent the most  successful
              invasion of land by any animal group.  This grant will  also support
              development of new statistical methods to estimate the  dates of the major
              events in arthropod evolution, and, includes an  innovative plan to develop
              teaching modules to expose underprivileged  K-12 students in the Los Angeles
              region, and elsewhere in the country, to the evolution of the charismatic
              Arthropoda.
