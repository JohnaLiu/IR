Abstract    :
              This project will intercompare three techniques that focus on air-sea gas
              exchange of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) to help evaluate the utility and accuracy of
              flux measurements in the field. Accurate measurements of DMS flux are important
              in estimating the oceanic source of reduced sulfur to the atmosphere and
              calculating the uptake of CO2 by the oceans. This research is important for
              climate change research since DMS can lead to sulfate aerosols that in turn can
              lead to cloud formation. The P.I. will use a gradient flux in-situ method to
              measure DMS flux and compare their results with several eddy correlation
              methods being used by other researchers from a highly instrumented platform in
              the North Sea off the Netherlands.
