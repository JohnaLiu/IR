Abstract    :
              The long range goal of this project is to build methods to infer genetic
              networks from gene chip or microarray transcription profiles. The methods
              developed are also envisioned to enable experimental design. The approach
              proposed is a staged one consisting of initially building a low-resolution
              dynamic model that fits observed data, and then to improve such a model to
              identify hidden variables in order to increase its predictive power.  To
              achieve that objective, a series of kinetic functions for gene expression will
              be developed and made available on the Internet (where they will be
              peer-reviewed).  These models will be used to generate artificial gene
              expression data.  The data analysis algorithms will thus be developed and
              tested using a known in silico source to assess robustness and areas for
              further improvement.
