Abstract    :
              The goal of the Fifth Annual Conference on Computational Genomics (CG2001) is to
              bring together leading scientists from around the world to discuss advances in
              computational methods for analysis of genome sequences.  The meeting addresses
              these topics from the perspective of biological scientists attempting to make
              sense of the vast quantities of data now becoming available.  The goal of the
              meeting is to provide a forum for a combination of invited speakers, speakers
              selected from submitted abstracts, and poster presenters to discuss their work
              and exchange ideas.  The support from NSF will provide new funding for student
              travel fellowships, in order to increase the level of student participation in
              the meeting.  This will also help in the professional development of the
              students and the long-term development of the field of computational genomics.
