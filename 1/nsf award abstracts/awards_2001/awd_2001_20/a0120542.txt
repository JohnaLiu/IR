Abstract    :
              The Triangle Coalition for Science and Technology Education initiated the Albert
              Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship program in 1990.  This program
              provides outstanding secondary mathematics and science teachers with an
              opportunity to serve in the national public policy arena.  NSF funding will
              support an Einstein Fellow in the Informal Science Education (ISE) program. 
              The Fellow will bring practical insight derived from being a classroom teacher
              to ISE and contribute to the program development and management.  The ISE
              program supports large regional and national projects targeting informal
              learners that include linkages to formal education.  The Einstein Fellow can
              contribute feasible suggestions on how those linkages can occur, while learning
              about the proposal development, submission, peer review and award process.  The
              11-month experience will enable the educator to learn about the field of
              informal science education from a national perspective through direct
              interaction with practitioners and participation in professional development.  
              Collegial exchange occurs monthly as Fellows serving in other Federal agencies
              meet to discuss their experiences.  Additionally, participants are required to
              submit three written reports to document their experiences.
