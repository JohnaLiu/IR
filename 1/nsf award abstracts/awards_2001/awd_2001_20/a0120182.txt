Abstract    :
              This is funding to subsidize travel and housing expenses of students selected to
              participate in the Student Research Workshop to be held in conjunction with the
              2nd Annual Meeting of the North American Chapter of the Association for
              Computational Linguistics (NAACL-2001), which will take place June 3-7, 2001 in
              Pittsburgh.  The intimate workshop format will  encourage student participants
              to begin building a rapport with established researchers.   Students will have
              sufficient time to present their research (25 minutes) and then receive
              feedback from a panel of established researchers in the field (15 minutes).  
              The workshop will provide students with invaluable exposure to outside
              perspectives on their work at a critical time in their research, and will also
              allow them to put their work into perspective based on feedback from the panel
              and from fellow participants.
