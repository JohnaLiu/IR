Abstract    :
              The FASEB Summer Conference on Prokaryotic Transcription Initiation will be held
              July 14-19, 2001, at the Vermont Academy in Saxton's River, Vermont.  The
              meeting will bring together biochemists, biophysicists, and geneticists.  It
              will focus on eubacteria, but there will be consideration of both archaea and
              eukaryotes where comparison is interesting.  Areas of intense study that will
              be featured at the 2001 FASEB conference include the following:

1. Structure
              of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases
2. Sigma factors and core interactions
3.
              Promoter recognition and initiation
4. Transcription activation
5. Complex
              regulation
6. Global regulation
7. Formation and stability of elongation
              complexes

All cells regulate the flow of information from DNA to protein at
              several different levels. A primary, and most economical, target of regulation
              is the initiation of transcription, the process by which the information in a
              gene on a chromosome is encoded in a small (relative to a chromosome) mobile
              form for use by the cell.  Using easily manipulated bacterial systems,
              scientists have discovered many fundamental principles of transcriptional
              regulation and are exploring many more today.  This meeting will facilitate the
              free exchange of experimental results and ideas so essential to this scientific
              search.  The financial support provided by the National Science Foundation will
              enable students and postdoctoral fellows to attend this important
              meeting.
