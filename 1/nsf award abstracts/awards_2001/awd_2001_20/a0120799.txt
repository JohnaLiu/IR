Abstract    :
              The SERC addresses the needs for software productivity and quality.  It also
              provides a focal point for the exchange of ideas among industry and academia 
              and serves as a direct infusion of these ideas, thereby accelerating technology
              transfer.  SERC resources include over 50 faculty and 100 students at 9
              universities working with practitioners from software intensive industries to
              solve software problems and advance the state-of-the-practice in software
              engineering.
