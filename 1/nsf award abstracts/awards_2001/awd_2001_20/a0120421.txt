It is important to understand and
              quantitatively model the linear and nonlinear rheology of highly concentrated
              micellar and colloidal systems.  The goal of the proposed research is to
              reproducibly formulate two types of systems with prescribed rheology.  These
              are the highly viscous and viscoelastic micellar solutions of telechetic
              polymers, as well as nanosize particles bearing terminally grafted chains that
              form brushes.  Although considerable work has been done to understand the
              behavior of associative polymers, this study will provide the fundamental
              understanding of the underlying structure of the micelles.  There is little
              information on the rheology of the nanosized brush-like particles.  Therefore,
              this study should provide new and exciting insight in the rheology of soft
              particles with the potential for unusual variations with concentration and the
              stress field.
