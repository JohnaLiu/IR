This grant provides support for the 3rd Biennial Geochemical
              SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) Workshop to be held at The Buttes Hotel
              and Conference Center in  Tempe, AZ, October 12-14, 2001. The third in a series
              of biennial workshops, this meeting will bring together the bulk of U.S.
              geoscientists who either manage, maintain and/or utilize secondary ion mass
              spectrometry for microspatial trace element and isotopic analyses of natural
              and man made materials.  The workshop will focus on presentations from the
              community that address developing new SIMS techniques for geological and
              cosmochemical applications, providing improved service to the community through
              NSF-sponsored SIMS facilities (i.e. WHOI; EAR-0115433 and  UCLA; EAR-0113563)
              and the sharing and development of laboratory standards.  The PI, Laurie
              Leshin, currently oversees a newly established (EAR-9871270) CAMECA 6f SIMS
              facility at Arizona State University and has included a list of invitees from
              the preeminent SIMS labs in U.S. academia and government labs.  Additional
              attendees will include representatives from the manufactures of SIMS instrument
              (CAMECA and Australian Scientific Instruments) and should ensure that the
              analytical needs of U.S. geoscientists who use SIMS will be effectively
              transmitted to the private sector capable of facilitating instrumental
              improvements.
