Abstract    :
              Middle Tennessee State University is using a planning grant to design a
              demonstration program, WISUP@MTSU, (Women in SMET Undergraduate Programs @
              MTSU). The project team is investigating and identifying the best practices to
              attract and to retain women in all fields of science, mathematics, engineering,
              and technology and to to build on successful programs already in place at MTSU.
              The goal is to design a technology intensive and supportive program to attract
              and to retain high school senior and undergraduate freshmen women into SMET
              disciplines at MTSU. The experience, technical and scientific talents of the
              WISUP Team and the strong support from the College of Basic and Applied
              Sciences and the university will result in a successful planning grant and the
              submission of a full demonstration proposal in the next NSF/PGE funding
              cycle.

MTSU is currently graduating slightly less than the national
              percentage of women in the SMET disciplines, yet university-wide the majority
              of both undergraduate and graduate students are female (54%). The institution
              is uniquely situated to serve rural and urban, low-income, and first generation
              students. MTSU also graduates more teachers than any university in Tennessee
              (more than 25% of all teachers in the entire state). The full program to be
              proposed should reach not only potential SMET students but also public school
              teachers who can encourage their student to consider SMET majors and careers.
