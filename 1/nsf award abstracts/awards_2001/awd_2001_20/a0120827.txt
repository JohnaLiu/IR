              Project Abstract:
The proposed research examines distributed sensing and
              control as an integral component of self-healing structures. This research
              integrates structural health monitoring methods with smart materials,
              statistical pattern recognition, and control to produce a class of structures
              having the ability to detect damage and to perform active control to compensate
              for the damage.  

The objectives of the proposed research consist of:
1)
              Integrating pattern recognition and data compression into the impedance-based
              health monitoring technique;
2) Integrating elements of health monitoring and
              control to create self-repairing structures and machines;
3) Investigating
              temperature and pressure effects on simultaneous health monitoring and
              control;
4) Experimentally verifying our results and using the results of our
              experiments to modify and improve our theories;

The engineering results of
              this research are systems that detect a problem, warn of the existence of the
              detected damage and then make a temporary repair, all while remaining in
              service.  This scenario would allow systems to remain in service after a
              problem develops and to continue in operation until a convenient time for a
              more permanent repair is possible. By making the structures substantially
              easier to inspect and resistant to failure, costly periodic "down-time" of
              equipment will be significantly reduced.  Industrial structures such as
              airframes, automobiles and machines can benefit from the application of the
              technology developed in this proposal.
