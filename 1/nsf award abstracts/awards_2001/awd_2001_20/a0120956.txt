Abstract    :
              The PI will address large-scale low-frequency phenomena that dominate tropical
              processes and have sources either within the tropics or higher latitudes. The
              principal phenomena of interest are the Asian-Australian monsoon and El Nino
              Southern Oscillation and their component modes, all of which range in time
              scale from intraseasonal to interannual. The PI proposes to focus on the
              following four specific research themes:

(1) the monsoon as a coupled
              ocean-atmosphere phenomena; 
(2) monsoon intraseasonal variability in a
              coupled ocean-atmosphere context;
(3) mechanisms by which the tropics
              influence the extratropics and vice versa on time scales that range from
              synoptic to interannual; and
(4) the variable nature of the long-term
              relationships between boundary forcing and climate variability. 

The work is
              important because it will lead to improved understanding of major climate
              phenomena, especially the monsoon over a wide range of time scales.
