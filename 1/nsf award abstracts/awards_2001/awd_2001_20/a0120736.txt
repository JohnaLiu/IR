Abstract    :
              The central goal of this project is to understand the complex linkages between
              biogeochemical cycles, vegetation, disturbance, and climate across the full
              summer temperature gradient in the Arctic in order to better predict ecosystem
              responses to changing climate. The project focuses on frost-boils because: (1)
              The processes that are involved in the self-organization of these landforms
              drive biogeochemical cycling and vegetation succession of extensive arctic
              ecosystems. (2) These ecosystems contain perhaps the most diverse and
              ecologically important zonal ecosystems in the Arctic and are important to
              global carbon budgets. (3) The complex ecological relationships between
              patterned-ground formation, biogeochemical cycles, and vegetation and the
              significance of these relationships at multiple scales have not been studied.
              (4) The responses of the system to changes in temperature are likely to be
              nonlinear, but can be understood and modeled by examining the relative
              strengths of feedbacks between the components of the system at several sites
              along the natural arctic temperature gradient.
