Abstract    :
              The organizers are requesting funding to support a student-organized symposium
              and workshop to be held at the next annual meeting (November 9-12, 2001) of the
              Western Society of Naturalists (WSN). 

The symposium, entitled "Integrative
              Approaches to Natural History", will explore the role of non-traditional
              research to the study natural history. The proposed speakers represent diverse
              fields, ranging from evolutionary biology and ecology to molecular biology;
              some work in terrestrial systems and some in marine systems. The common thread
              uniting these scientists from different disciplines is the way that they use
              techniques from other fields of biology (e.g. genetics, biochemistry, molecular
              biology, physiology) to gain insight into the ecology and evolution of their
              systems. 

The workshop, entitled "Communicating Science to Non-scientists",
              will be an interactive tutorial on how to disseminate research results to the
              media, policy makers, and general public. Therefore, unlike most symposia and
              workshops at ecology or evolutionary biology meetings that focus on specific
              topics within a field, these events seek to cut across diverse biological
              fields to discuss general themes in the way scientists conduct and disseminate
              their research. The purpose of the symposium and workshop is not only to
              explore these important and timely topics, but also to provide students with
              the valuable experience of organizing and running their own events and
              participating in the governance of a scientific society.
