Title:   Designing for Diversity: 
              Investigating Electronic Games as Pathways for Girls into Information
              Technology Professions

This award provides support for a 2-year study to
              research design criteria of electronic games that affirm and support 8-14 year
              old girls' positive notions of (Information Technology) IT professions.  While
              much is known about general characteristics of games that appeal to girls and
              boys, there is a little information about the specific game design features,
              characteristics and problems that might successfully attract different children
              into IT.  The study is expected to result in the development of specific design
              criteria for game designers and practical guidance for educators interested in
              using games to foster children's IT skills and interests.
