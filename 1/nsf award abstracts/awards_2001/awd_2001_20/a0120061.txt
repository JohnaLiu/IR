              Abstract

In this renewal proposal, Dr. Klewicki plans to carry out further
              experimental investigations on the effect large Reynolds number on the
              cross-stream transport in a turbulent boundary layer.  Even though much has
              been learned form the experiments carried out under the current Grant
              CTS-9905526, better understanding of such transport mechanisms can be obtained
              when the experimental parameter range is extended, and additional transport
              terms measured.  The experiments will be carried out in a wind tunnel and in an
              environmental test facility in the Great Salt Lake Desert in Utah.  In the
              current Grant, 3 undergraduate students participated in the experimental work
              through the REU program.
