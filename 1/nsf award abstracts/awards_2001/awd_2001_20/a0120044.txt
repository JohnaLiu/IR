This award will support Dr. Dong-Shik Kim, Assistant Professor
              at the University of Toledo, for a planning visit to develop collaborative
              research with Dr. Sang Jun Sim, Senior Research Scientist at the Korea
              Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), in the area of water treatment
              design.  A hybrid water treatment system, using both ozonation and
              biofiltration, will be explored.  Dr. Kim has expertise on biofilms, while KIST
              offers expertise in system design and pilot plant operation.  This planning
              visit is meant to enable Dr. Kim to develop detailed plans for a synergistic,
              mutually beneficial collaborative research project.
