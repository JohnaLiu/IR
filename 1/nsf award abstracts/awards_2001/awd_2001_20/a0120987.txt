With this award under
              the MPS Internships in Public Science Education Program, the Adler Planetarium
              will sponsor a unique graduate fellowship program. The Adler Public Education
              Fellowship is aimed at drawing young researchers into closer ties with public
              education and outreach.  Each year, a graduate student actively involved in
              research will be selected as a Fellow and will be responsible for planning,
              developing, managing and teaching a 4-5 week summer program for local high
              school students and carrying out a program of public observing/demonstrations
              on the Apache Point 3.5meter telescope.  The Astro-Science Workshop will be a
              themed, research-based experience combining lectures by prominent
              astronomers/astrophysicists and hands-on student research and exploration. 
              Because the Fellowship is intended to promote the development of
              researchers/educators, the Fellow is also expected to continue a vigorous
              program of research at their home institution.  

This award is funded by the
              MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.
