Title:   Entry, Earnings Growth, and
              Retention in IT Careers:  An Economic Study

This proposal provides support
              for the University of California Santa Barbara to conduct three studies which
              together address questions pertaining to the college major choices of young
              women, and to the persistence and labor market success of college-educated
              women in Information Technology Workforce (IT) careers.  The first study will
              examine the career paths of women who already have IT degrees and will explore
              whether there are labor market barriers that make IT careers less appealing to
              women.  The second is a longitudinal study that will utilize decision theory to
              scrutinize common assumptions of economic models of career choice.  The third
              study will survey young women's beliefs (or stereotypes) about the
              characteristics of IT jobs and the women who fill them.  The information from
              this last survey will be linked to the longitudinal second study so that
              correlations between these beliefs and later career outcomes can be
              determined.
