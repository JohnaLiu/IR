Title:  Paths to Retention and Turnover in
              the IT Workforce: Understanding the Relationships Between Gender, Minority
              Status, Job and Organizational Factors

This ITWF award provides support for
              the University of Wisconsin to conduct a study that will identify the job,
              organizational and quality of working life (QWL) factors that influence
              turnover intention within the current IT workforce, and the way gender and
              minority status play a role in the relationships between job and organizational
              factors, QWL and intention to turnover.  Two different models of the role of
              gender and minority status will be used and tested and compared in a sample of
              IT employees across a range of companies and jobs. The first research model
              postulates that gender and minority status have direct effects on job and
              organizational factors and both direct and indirect effects on QWL and
              intention to turnover. The second research model postulates that gender and
              minority status play a moderating role in the relationship between job and
              organizational factors and QWL and intention to turnover.
