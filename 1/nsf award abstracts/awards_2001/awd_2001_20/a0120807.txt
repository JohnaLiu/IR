Abstract    :
              This award establishes a research site at the Arizona State University of the
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Water Quality
              (WQC) located at the University of Arizona.  The research will focus on applied
              health-related water microbiology and environmental engineering.  The overall
              objective is to perform research to improve the quality of drinking water and
              investigate physical, chemical and microbial processes that affect the quality
              of potable water supplies.  In addition, the IUCRC at Arizona State University
              will establish an undergraduate training program for the minority students.  A
              number of area municipalities and industries will form an industrial consortium
              to provide financial and intellectual support of the research site.
