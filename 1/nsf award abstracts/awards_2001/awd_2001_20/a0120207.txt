              ABSTRACT

Building Diversity in,  and through, Environmental
              Journalism

This award seeks to strengthen the understanding of the Earth and
              environment among populations underrepresented in geosciences by improving the
              quality and quantity of coverage of the environment in media that reach these
              communities.  The Society of Environmental Journalists and the Earth &
              Environmental Science Journalism Program at Columbia University will work with
              minority journalists, with journalists employed by minority-serving media
              organizations, and with the professional societies of minority journalists (the
              Native American Journalists Association, the National Association of Black
              Journalists, and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists) to raise
              interest in covering the Earth and environment among journalists of color and
              journalists who serve minority communities; raise awareness among non-minority
              journalists and editors of how minority audiences can be served through
              environmental reporting; exchange skills and information resources for better
              reporting on environmental issues of special interest to minority communities;
              foster grassroots collegial relationships and collaborations between individual
              journalists of color and environmental journalists; foster institutional
              partnerships between the professional societies of environmental journalists
              and minority journalists; showcase and reward exemplary environmental
              journalism by journalists who are members of underrepresented minorities.
