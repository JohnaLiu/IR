Abstract    :
              The ultimate goal is to engineer artificial viruses for deployment as gene
              therapy vehicles.  The goal of the proposed work is to unravel how DNA/polymer
              complexes navigate through the cell.  In particular, the movement between
              endocytic vesicles and transit across the nuclear envelope will be explored. 
              Polymers will be chosen and functionalized to have different buffering and
              nuclear import properties in order to facilitate the tracking within the cell. 
              Single cells will be observed as well as cell populations.  Success will
              contribute to improving the understanding and efficacy of cell transformation
              and gene therapy technologies.
