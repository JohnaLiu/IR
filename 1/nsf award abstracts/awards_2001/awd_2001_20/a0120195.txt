Abstract    :
              This award is for the partial support of the International Conference on
              Differential Equations and Mathematical Physics. The conference is a part of
              the series of conferences that were held six times at the University of Alabama
              and twice at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The conference will cover a
              broad range of topics, including: analysis of Schrodinger operators, quantum
              electrodynamics, fluid dynamics, conservation laws, evolution equations,
              spectral and scattering theory, inverse problems and many related topics. The
              list of plenary speakers includes many world class established researchers and
              young talented mathematicians.
