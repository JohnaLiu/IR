Abstract    :
              Numerical integrations will be performed to study the 2-day wave in a
              generally-unstable mean flow.  Modal period and structure and its amplification
              will be calculated in the presence of zonal-mean structure representative of
              observations.  Those calculated features will then be compared with observed
              space-time behavior of the 2-day wave.  Finite amplitude considerations,
              leading to transport and to interaction with other planetary waves, will be
              addressed in fully-nonlinear integrations.  Together with observed behavior,
              those integrations will be used to evaluate the impact that 2-day wave
              nonlinearity has on dynamical and chemical structure.  The research outlined
              here promises a unified understanding of the 2-day wave and its role in the
              general circulation of the middle and upper atmosphere.
