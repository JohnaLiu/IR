Title:  Information Technology Educational
              Pathways of African-Americans:  A Synthetic Study with NELS 1988-2000 Data and
              Case Studies.

This award to CSR, Incorporated provides support for a 3-year
              study to examine the secondary and postsecondary educational pathways that
              African-American youth follow to pursue information technology(IT) careers. 
              The study will distinguish specific factors linked to the successful pursuit of
              IT education from other generic predictors of educational attainment.  The
              finding are intended to guide sound policy and program decisions that will
              support an equitable participation of African -Americans in the IT education
              and workforce.  The study will compare the educational pathways taken by
              African-Americans to pursue careers in IT with similar pursuits in
              other"pre-professional" careers in law, medicine, and business administration,
              and the fields of science, mathematics, engineering, and technology
