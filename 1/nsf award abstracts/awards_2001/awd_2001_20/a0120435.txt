Biogeochemical Cycles of Carbon and Nitrogen in an Ice-Covered
              Volcanic Crater Lake

Project Description

This is a 1 year research
              planning and exploratory proposal to investigate the microbial ecology of and
              ice-covered crater lake within the active Grimsvotn Volcano in Iceland.  The
              proposal anticpates that there is an active microbial community under the
              Grimsvotn ice-covered lake.  Because of the simplicity of the biogeochemical
              environment and its isolation from other inputs other than volcanic and
              glacial, it is suggested to be an excellent location to pursue coupled
              biocomplexity studies.  The proposal will evaluate four hypotheses by sampling
              the lake through the ice using hot-water drilling equipment.  Samples will be
              collected from different lake depths and examined using: microscopy,
              cultivation, stable isotopic analyses, molecular biological tools, C and N
              fixation assays, and phylogentic analysis of genes involved in N
              fixation.
