The 23rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE/EMBS
              (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers/Engineering in Medicine and
              Biology Society) is to held in Istanbul, October 25-28, 2001. The technical
              program of the meeting includes the five mini-symposia of Bioinformatics,
              Nanotechnology in Biomedicine, Functional Imaging, Modeling as a Tool in
              Neuromuscular and Rehabilitation Research, and Neural Imaging and Computational
              Imaging. The mini-symposia will introduce prospective investigators to the
              state-of-the-science in these increasingly important areas of biomedical
              engineering research.

Support is being provided to cover partial travel
              costs for 20 speaker-participants in the mini-symposia. Individuals who receive
              support are to be selected based on the following: participation in the
              mini-symposia; young investigators; diversity (gender; minority; disabled);
              symposia organizers.

Participants in the mini-symposia will learn about
              current research that will contribute to the development of technologies
              leading to new applications in medicine.  Each recipient of support is expected
              to submit a report describing the research discussed at the mini-symposia
              having the greatest potential for dramatically influencing the development of
              new medical technologies.
