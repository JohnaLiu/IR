This is a renewal proposal of the Grant CTS-9634261 "Mechanism of
              sediment transport 
in complex flows" which ended in August 2001.  In this
              Grant, the research is focused on the interaction mechanisms between the bed
              forms and the flow, and the processes by which the flow field moves the
              sediment grains as bedload or suspended load.  The investigations were carried
              out by experiments in a flume and simple method of predicting sediment flux
              over a two-dimensional dune was developed.  In the present proposal, the PI
              plans to investigate the processes governing how gradients in sediment flux
              give rise to changes in bed topography.  More specifically, it is proposed to
              investigate five different types of flow with increasing complexity.
