              Abstract

In this renewal proposal, the PI proposes to continue his
              investigation of turbulent flow especially in terms of Large Eddy Simulation
              (LES) modeling.  In order to obtain accurate LES modeling, transport in the
              small scales, sub-grid scale, of momentum as well as scalar quantities such as
              temperature and concentration need to be known.  In this proposal, the PI will
              concentrate on the study of passive scalar dynamics in turbulence.
Experiments
              will be performed on heated cylinder wake, heated jet, and grid turbulence with
              temperature gradient to obtain the sub-grid scale transport of heat and
              momentum in these flows.  Results of the experiments will used to formulate
              appropriate SGS modeling for application in LES.
