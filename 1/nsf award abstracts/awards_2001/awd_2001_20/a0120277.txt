Abstract    :
              The aim of the proposed work is to extend the use of linear and other network
              analysis tools.  The addition of logical information in model constraints to
              emulate regulatory logic will be pursued.  Mixed integer linear programming
              will be among the tools employed.  Two general approaches will be used.  The
              first entails encoding a check to see if a flux solution is consistent with the
              kinetic and regulatory structure of the network.  The second involves
              superimposing transcript ratio data from DNA arrays within probabilistic
              framework that account for the lack of linearity between transcript level and
              gene product activity.
