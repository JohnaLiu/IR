Abstract    :
              This project will extend a long-term program to measure trends of atmospheric
              carbon dioxide (CO2) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in seawater, and
              their 13C/12C isotopic ratios.  These measurements, that date back several
              decades, will be used along with other climatic data, such as satellite-borne
              radiometric data of greenness of land vegetation, to estimate net exchanges of
              CO2 between the oceans, the atmosphere, and the terrestrial biosphere.  This
              research is relevant to understanding the impacts of climate and human
              activities on the global carbon cycle.  Data collected as part of this project
              will become part of the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) data
              archive.
