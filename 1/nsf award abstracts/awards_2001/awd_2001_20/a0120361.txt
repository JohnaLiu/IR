Abstract    :
              The long range goal of this project is to develop models of how the cellular
              environment influences gene expression and metabolic network response.  The
              approach entails probing and modeling how viruses can redirect metabolic
              function in a host.  Viruses "encode" a manageable amount of information and
              thus a virus-host system may prove to be a tractable system.  After performing
              quantitative kinetic studies of the growth of duck Hepatitis B (duck) virus,
              stochastic and deterministic models will be developed and contrasted.
