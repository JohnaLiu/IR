OPP-0120174

The international survey of living conditions among
              indigenous peoples across the Arctic involves a partnership of researchers and
              indigenous organizations in Greenland, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland,
              Denmark, Russia, and the United States.  This portion of the project focuses on
              indigenous households in Alaska's North Slope, Northwest Arctic, and Bering
              Straits regions.  The goal of the international study is to develop an
              integrated set of individual, household, community, and regional databases for
              use in comparative analyses of living conditions among Arctic populations.
