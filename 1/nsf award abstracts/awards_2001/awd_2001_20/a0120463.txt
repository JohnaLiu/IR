Abstract    :
              This project aims to use hydrothermal synthesis techniques to expand the
              inorganic materials chemistry of metal oxides and specifically to discover new
              open framework structures with potential for use as sorbents or heterogeneous
              catalysts. An important direction is an emphasis on microporous solids with
              stability and intracrystalline reactivity. Two major classes of inorganic
              materials have been targeted, the group VB transition metal phosphates, and the
              group VB transition metal silicates and germanates. Initial studies indicate
              that many new microporous framework silicates can be constructed and this a
              major focus of the research. New synthesis techniques that will be developed
              include the modification of standard hydrothermal reaction conditions and the
              use of higher pressures where necessary. Training of both undergraduate and
              graduate students will be emphasized. In particular the participation of women
              and other underrepresented groups in the research will be emphasized. 

New
              nanoporous inorganic solids with improved properties that will have
              applications in molecule separations and as catalysts in chemical reactions are
              vital to the needs of the petrochemical industry in areas that include oil
              refining and chemicals production. Improvements in chemical processing are
              important for more effective use of U.S.  hydrocarbon resources and to increase
              energy efficiency.
