Abstract    :
              Xavier University of Louisiana is using a planning grant to develop a research
              project aimed at understanding more about African American female students who
              are drawn to and succeed in computer sciences. The research plan is to
              characterize students in this group who are interested in computing sciences,
              find the motivating factors of success, and classify the views they have of the
              profession. Based on this research, undergraduate programs could be shaped to
              increase the numbers of African American females entering undergraduate
              computing sciences and encourage those in the field of study to continue
              through graduate school.

Xavier is developing partnerships with other HBCUs
              and universities to collaborate in the future project, develop corporate
              partners, develop graduate school partners (in particular those experience with
              research procedures and women's issues), establish an advisory board, and
              obtain definitions of roles and cooperative agreements.
