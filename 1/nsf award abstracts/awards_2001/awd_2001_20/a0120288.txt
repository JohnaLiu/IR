Abstract    :
              The overall aim is to elucidate the operating and design principles of metabolic
              and genetic networks. Two complementary strategies will be merged. The first is
              a theoretical analysis of small, modular pathways, which form the building
              blocks of biochemical systems, and of composites of these modules. The analysis
              will elucidate the dynamic activation profiles of enzymes that yield optimal
              responses to demands like brief peak availability of a metabolite or sustained
              change in metabolite composition. The second strategy will entail
              reconstituting sphingolipid metabolism in E. coli and using this as an
              experimental model for studying fluxes and the effects of specific regulatory
              interventions.  The system thus has the potential to provide an in vivo
              laboratory for studying de novo pathway design.
