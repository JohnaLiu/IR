More than a century of metal mining in the Northwest region
              of the U.S. has created numerous open water extreme environments with unusual
              metal and chemical composition.  In addition to their status as Superfund
              sites, these environments also represent large-scale outdoor laboratories in
              which it is highly likely that unusual biogeochemical cycles and microbial
              metabolic strategies exist.  We are requesting one year of funding through the
              SGER component of this program to facilitate development of a
              multidisciplinary, polyphasic approach that is generally applicable to
              resolving the chemical and biological components of biogeochemical cycling in a
              series of these extreme and unusual aquatic environments that vary in key
              biogeochemical parameters.
Considering the unique nature of these
              environments, and the paucity of information on the biological component of the
              biogeochemical cycles, preliminary fundino, is necessary to develop appropriate
              sampling strategies, equipment and analytical techniques, assemble the
              requisite expertise, determine the key parameters to measure, and develop a
              model framework adequate for dealing with a suite of extreme aquatic
              environments proposed for future study.  The requested year of funding will
              provide preliminary data, methodologies, and demonstration of feasibility that
              will allow us to prepare a full proposal for the 2002 Biocomplexity Program
              Call.
