Abstract    :
              On several billions of hectares, modern land uses are transforming soil
              biocomplexity, the interactions between the extremely diverse soil biota and
              biogeochemical pattern and process. Regrettably, our understanding of this
              transformation lags far behind our impact.  This award constitutes  an
              ambitious planning grant, composed of a variety of the nation's  leading soil
              biologists and biogeochemists as well as highly talented young scientists, to
              evaluate how and why soil biocomplexity is altered by long-practiced land uses.
              The project features the soils of the old cotton belt of the southern United
              States, soils highly disturbed by long-continued agriculture and forestry. The
              team will meet on two occasions as a full group to conceptualize a model of
              land use impacts on soil biota and biogeochemistry, and perform preliminary
              work on novel collections and samples from the long-term Calhoun Experimental
              Forest, located near Spartanburg, South Carolina. The team will apply new
              expertise in a variety of complex analytical and sampling techniques.
