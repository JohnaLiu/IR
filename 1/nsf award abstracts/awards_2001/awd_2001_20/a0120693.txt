Abstract    :
              The goal of this Biocomplexity incubation study is to develop an approach for
              studying coupled biogeochemical cycles in urban and agricultural ecosystems,
              with a primary focus on nitrogen. A series of focused workshops will be held
              addressing topics including: identification of knowledge gaps regarding key
              processes, issues regarding temporal and spatial scales, developing a modeling
              framework, and integration and education. The study regions for the full-scale
              research program will be the Central Arizona-Phoenix ecosystem (currently site
              of a Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program) and the Minnesota River-Twin
              Cities ecosystem (currently subject of an interdisciplinary watershed study).
              The existing extensive databases from these and other studies will facilitate
              the initiation of this project. Understanding coupled biogeochemical cycles in
              human ecosystems (cities and farms) will lead to a holistic, integrated
              approach for effective pollution management.
