Abstract    :
              This award will support an international workshop entitled "10th International
              Conference on Luminescence and Electron-Spin-Resonance Dating."  The conference
              will examine the utility of trapped-electron dating (TED) for establishing the
              age of geologic and archaeological materials.

The purpose of the conference
              is to bring together international experts, practitioners, and students to
              share the latest developments in this dating technique.  NSF support for this
              conference will enable the University of Nevada Desert Research Institute to
              serve as the first host of this conference in the Western Hemisphere.  This is
              important because TED is gaining use among American scientists as a dating
              technique.  Having experts from Europe gather in the United States is a
              cost-effective way for American researchers to gain first-hand knowledge of the
              technique.
