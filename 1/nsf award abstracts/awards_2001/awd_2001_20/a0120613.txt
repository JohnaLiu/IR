Abstract    :
              Ruben G. Carbonell of North Carolina State University, Mary A. Brittain of the
              North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, and Joseph M. DeSimone of the
              University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill have support from the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities to establish a Math and Physical
              Sciences-Internship in Public Science Education (MPS-IPSE) in the area of
              Carbon Dioxide in Nature and Technology.  The program is a joint effort of the
              Kenan Institute for Engineering, Technology and Science at NC State University,
              the NSF Science and Technology Center for Environmentally Responsible Solvents
              and Processes (CERSP) led by UNC Chapel Hill, and the North Carolina Museum of
              Natural Sciences.  Outstanding math and science K-12 teachers from the Research
              Triangle area in North Carolina will be recruited as MPS Fellows for a
              three-year program.  During this time period, the Fellows will have summer
              internships at the NC Museum of Natural Sciences and the NSF CERSP facilities
              at NC State University and the UNC Chapel Hill.  Scientists in the CERSP and
              staff in the museum will serve as mentors throughout the three-year program to
              help the teachers develop novel curriculum tools for K-12 education, and
              educational programs and displays for the museum public.  At the same time, the
              teachers will be able to obtain graduate credit for advanced degrees in
              education at local universities, and they will participate in professional and
              personal leadership training programs throughout the academic year.
