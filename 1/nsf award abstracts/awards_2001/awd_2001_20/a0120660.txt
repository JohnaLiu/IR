Abstract    :
              This award supports the planning and meeting of groups of researchers working on
              Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites ranging from the Alaskan tundra to
              the Florida Everglades to compare data and develop a cross biome study
              comparing carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous dynamics to test the central
              scientific hypothesis that in systems characterized by low nutrient
              availability, there exists a pattern of differential nutrient limitation among
              the primary producers and the heterotrophs.
