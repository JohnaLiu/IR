Abstract    :
              DEB-0121050 - Karban
Over the past two decades ecologists have come to
              recognize that indirect effects are widespread and important in many
              communities.  Induced resistance represents one type of indirect effect that
              has received a lot of study, although ecologists are very skeptical about
              plant-plant communication as a mechanism for induced resistance.  In fact, most
              ecologists discount the possibility of communication between plants because
              early reports of this phenomenon were not convincing.  However, my recent
              fieldwork suggests that wild tobacco plants "eavesdrop" on clipped sagebrush
              neighbors and induce higher levels of resistance to their shared herbivores. 
              This communication appears to be mediated by an airborne cue released by
              sagebrush, perhaps methyl jasmonate.  This proposal asks two questions: 1) How
              general is eavesdropping?  2) Is methyl jasmonate the airborne cue?  If
              eavesdropping proves to be widespread then the spectrum of interactions within
              plant communities may be much richer than we now appreciate.  Widespread
              eavesdropping suggests a much greater role for associational resistance and
              susceptibility, and for spatial structure in general.
