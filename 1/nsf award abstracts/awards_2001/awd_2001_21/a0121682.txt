Defining and understanding
              the evolutionary relationships among species is fundamental to contemporary
              biology and the application of the comparative method in the life sciences. 
              The results of such evolutionary research can be represented by a branching
              sequence of relatedness among species known as a phylogeny.  Because of the
              geometric resemblance of a phylogeny to the branches of a tree, a phylogeny can
              be thought of as a tree of life.  The proposed collaborative research by
              biologists and computer scientists at University of Texas-Austin and at
              CUNY-Lehman College in New York will provide specialized visualization and data
              mining tools to facilitate creation of a "Tree of Life" for all living
              organisms on the earth.  This includes the development and refinement of
              algorithms to visualize and analyze multiple complex data sets for large
              numbers of species.  More specifically, this project will:  (1) integrate
              biological data through visualization and clustering techniques developed by
              computer scientists, and (2) apply these tools to taxa which comprise very
              large numbers of species with topologically complex and varied tree structures.
               The interdisciplinary team of biologists and computer scientists will
              integrate their newly developed software with existing computational tools in
              systematic biology, and make them freely available to and easily used by the
              scientific community.  The project involves substantive efforts to provide
              undergraduates and students from under-represented groups with the opportunity
              to collaborate with scientists throughout the academic year and summer.
