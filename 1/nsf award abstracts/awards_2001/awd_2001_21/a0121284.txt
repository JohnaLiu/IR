Abstract    :
              The conference is to cover the topic of "Nonhomogenous Harmonic Analysis".   The
              principal lecturer will be Sasha Volberg. He will show how the Bellman
              technique from the area of Operations Research can be modified to solve many
              difficult problems in the area noted. He will in particular address deep
              questions to Calderon-Zygmund kernels, Tb theorems, two weight problems, 
              capacity problems, some questions in Quasi-conformal mappings as well as
              several other topics. The material will cover the topics in the  most
general
              settings (i.e. R^n), non-regular  measures, etc..
