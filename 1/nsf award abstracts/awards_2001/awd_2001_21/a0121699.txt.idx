Abstract    :
              The Reciprocal Net project is constructing and deploying an extensive
              distributed and open digital collection of molecular structures. Associated
              with the collection are software tools for visualizing, interacting with, and
              rendering printable images of the contents; software for the automated
              conversion of local database representations into standard formats which can be
              globally shared; tools and components for constructing educational modules
              based on the collection; and examples of such modules as the beginning of a
              public repository for educational materials based on the collection. The
              contents of this collection come principally from structures contributed by
              participating crystallography laboratories, thus providing a means for
              teachers, students, and the general public to connect with current chemistry
              research. The collection will be fully integrated into the emerging NSDL
              framework, constituting a resource of outstanding value for education at every
              level. The methodologies and tools of the project enable it to be fully
              distributed and self-sustaining after the initial startup period.
