Abstract    :
              0121726 Orcutt  This project seeks to integrate disparate efforts in both the
              Earth sciences and information technology to develop a model approach for
              modern data collection and integration. The approach is to build upon existing
              sensor networks and wireless communications to develop the hardware and
              software needed for supporting research of the future and to make information
              available for emergency response, informed decision-making, outreach and
              education, and enhanced scientific discovery. In particular the existing
              southern California scientific and educational wireless network will be
              extended along the coast from San Diego to Santa Barbara and to the oceans
              beyond the Channel Islands. Because of southern California's reliance on water
              from the Sierra snow pack and the dependence of this source of water on
              climate, we will extend the network to include Yosemite National Park. Using
              this test bed the requirements and utility of wireless networks for collecting
              and streaming environmental sensor data in real-time will be demonstrated.
              Multidisciplinary data sets (e.g. earthquake, ocean current,
              hydrometeorological, and ecological) will be integrated to advance our
              understanding and management of coastal, ocean, riparian, and terrestrial
              geophysical phenomena and ecosystems in Southern California and well off shore.
              The software tools which must be developed for this integration do not exist,
              although limited prototype systems are available. In particular, existing
              concepts in object ring buffers (ORB) for collecting disciplinary data to
              virtual ORBs (VORB) for managing multiple connections to multiple field sensors
              will be extended. These VORBs will not only provide data to multiple users in
              real time, but will provide interfaces with archival ORB and more traditional
              databases. Many of these interactions will be mediated through XML wrappers
              which will provide the basis for data discovery. A rule-based programmable
              interface will be developed to dynamically reconfigure and prioritize data
              capture and analysis from this multiplicity of sensor networks. This approach
              should be scalable as network speeds increase and data volumes grow, likely
              geometrically.  Funding is provided under the Information Technology 
              Research Initiative.
