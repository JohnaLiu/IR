Abstract    :
              Our primary research goal is to develop a prototype voice-enabled translating
              communicator which will deliver information services across the linguistic
              divide for minority languages in order allow remote linguistically-diverse
              users to communicate directly with Internet content and databases, and more
              importantly to communicate with others speaking a different language from
              their own. The latter will enable information, education, and, for example,
              health services, to reach remote minority-language communities. Achieving this
              goal requires major advances in machine learning for translation and in
              cross-language speech-recognition adaptability to wider language
              phenomena.  Traditional transfer-rule-based MT requires up to a
              person-century to build and perfect a new language pair. Statistical
              and Example-Based MT replaces human coding effort by vast amounts
              of bilingual training data, which are virtually unobtainable for
              most minority languages. Without a radical advance, leading to
              an over-an-order-of-magnitude improvement in development time, the only
              commercially justifiable MT applications involve the major European languages,
              Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic and perhaps a couple more relatively-popular
              languages.  The vast majority of human languages are currently relegated to
              the proverbial MT dust heap.  We propose new MT approaches based on extended
              and new machine learning methods. The first approach consists of statistical
              MT methods that learn from orders of magnitude less training data, and that
              can more effectively incorporate prior linguistic information (including
              dictionaries, word classes, and known linguistic rule classes or constraints)
              by using the joint source-channel modeling approach combined with exponential
              (maximum entropy) models. The second approach is a new method for acquiring
              high-quality MT transfer rules from native informants which decreases
              dependence on human experts and reduces development time.
              Semantically-conditioned transfer rules are generalized via a new
              locally-constrained Seeded Version-Space method based on a controlled
              bilingual corpus and interactive tools to elicit information from native
              informants. The third method builds general phone models across multiple
              language families for speech recognition and adapts the recognizer to
              new languages with minimal new- language training data. All of these methods
              are based on new and existing machine learning algorithms that combine prior
              knowledge with limited amounts of new data in order to converge quickly on
              working machine translation and speech recognition and synthesis
              systems.  The primary societal impact will be a significant contribution to
              the global democratization of informa- tion, a process that requires bridging
              current linguistic barriers, especially for low-density or economically-
              disadvantaged languages. Additionally, preservation and teaching of endangered
              languages will be directly enabled by the new linguistic and acoustic
              knowledge coupled with existing tutorial software. If successful, Avenue
              (Adaptable Voice-Enabled Natural-translator for Universal Empowerment) will be
              the prototype of an MT system that will empower world-wide access to
              multilingual information.
