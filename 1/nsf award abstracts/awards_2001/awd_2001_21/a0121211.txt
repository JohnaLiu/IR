Abstract    :
              ITR/\(PE+SY\): Responsive Virtual Human Technology Research

Responsive
              virtual human technology (RVHT) is used in diverse fields (computer generated
              forces, manufacturing, medicine, theater), but not for interaction skills
              training. Yet interaction skills are usually critical. Specific situations
              identified where improved interaction skills would be important include:
              
Medical practitioners taking patient histories or interacting with
              children;
Law officers handling crisis situations involving mental illness,
              trauma, or violence; and Military officers interviewing refugees or settling
              stressed civilians.
This project will address multiple research issues
              relevant for RVHT to reach the sophistication required for robust interaction
              skills training. Important questions to be answered include:
    How is
              behavior modeled under normal conditions (i.e., a calm adult) and derivative
              conditions (e.g., anger, schizophrenia, pain, and childhood)?
   What
              expressions, gestures, movement, and other behaviors will users interpret as
              serene, angry, schizophrenic, pained, or childlike?
What skills can be
              acquired, practiced, and validated using RVHT? What is involved in providing a
              convincing simulation of human interaction where acquired skills transfer to a
              live environment?
The research results will expose a range of additional
              training and educational opportunities, such as interviewing risky behavior and
              presenting rare, traumatic events. Combinations of RVHT-based training and
              instructor-led training offer significantly reduced training development and
              delivery costs, and increased student throughput, while maintaining training
              effectiveness and consistency.
