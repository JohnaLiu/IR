Abstract    :
              Under the auspices of the Association of Research Libraries this project is
              modifying and repurposing the existing LibQUAL+ protocol for assessing the
              services provided for the user community of the National Science, Math,
              Engineering and Technology Education Digital Library (NSDL) program. Project
              goals include: (a) defining the dimensions of digital library service quality
              from the perspective of the users; (b) creating a tool for measuring user
              perceptions and expectations of digital library service quality across NSDL
              digital library contexts; (c) identifying digital library "best practices" that
              permit generalizations across operations and development platforms; (d)
              enhancing student learning by managing effectively user perceptions and
              expectations of digital library services; (e) establishing a digital library
              service quality assessment program as an integral part of the library service
              quality assessment program at the Association of Research Libraries; and (f)
              institutionalizing continuous product and process evaluation efforts directed
              toward positive and timely management of outcomes.
