Abstract    :
              The construction industry suffers from costly remedies associated with late
              defect detection at construction sites.  Frequent and accurate assessment of
              the status of work-in-place, identifying critical spatio-temporal and quality
              related deviations, and predicting the impacts of these deviations during a
              construction project are necessary for active project control and for
              developing an accurate project history. This research project builds on,
              combines and extends the advances in generating 3D environments using laser
              scanners, collecting quality information about built environments using
              embedded sensors, and generation and utilization of semantically-rich
              Architecture/Engineering/ Construction (A/E/C) project models, in developing an
              integrated early defect detection system.  The research objectives include: (1)
              formulating strategies/mechanisms to utilize laser scanning and embedded sensor
              systems for frequent and accurate collection and representation of spatial and
              quality related as-built data, (2) developing mechanisms for integrating and
              interpreting data acquired from these systems with the project model, (3)
              developing a general, flexible and integrated representation schema to model
              product, process and as-built information, and (4) formalizing mechanisms for
              automated defect detection and management. The expected contributions of this
              research fall within the fields of robotics, embedded sensing in civil
              engineering, A/E/C project modeling and analysis.  The societal impacts of this
              research include potential savings in rework and maintenance costs.
