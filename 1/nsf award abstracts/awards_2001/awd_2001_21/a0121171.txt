This Americas Program thesis enhancement project will support
              thesis dissertation research by Mr. Cameron Adams under the supervision of Dr.
              Eloise A. Berlin of the University of Georgia.  The study, in collaboration
              with El Colegio de la Frontera Sur (ECOSUR) in Chiapas, Mexico, aims to use
              cognitive methods to establish whether the Highland Maya have a shared
              ethnophysiology. A model of such a physiology will be developed and transcripts
              of open-ended interviews will be analyzed for structured metaphor
              usage.

Because perceptions of body function inform much of culturally
              defined medical behavior, including practices such as behavioral and medicinal
              prescriptions and /or proscriptions, researchers have argued that a thorough
              understanding of concepts of physiology lead to a greater understanding of any
              medical system. Through its modeling of Highland Maya ethnophysiology, the
              proposed research will serve to address various issues in medical and cognitive
              anthropology and advance efforts at developing culturally appropriate health
              care delivery systems for indigenous populations in Mexico and elsewhere.
