Abstract    :
              This project is a partnership is a partnership between the ERC for Particle
              Science and Technology at the University of Florida and the National Institute
              of Standards and Technology (NIST).  The objective is to provide fundamental
              information concerning the effectiveness of polymeric and surfactant dispersant
              layers during chemical and mechanical interactions with surfaces.  Direct
              measurement of surfaces force and characterization of dispersant layers under
              high applied loads, shear rates, and solution conditions will be used to
              develop dispersant selection criteria for optimal performance in extreme
              conditions.  The ERC's graduate students and researchers will be working in
              NIST laboratories and NIST personnel will visit the ERC to present seminars and
              teach students in new characterization techniques.
