Abstract    :
               0121767 Reible  This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) award,
              jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will consist
              of an intense two-week training course on many aspects of environmental
              contamination.  The goal of the course is to familiarize young and mid-career
              professionals in the field of remediation of contaminated sites with the latest
              research on in-sites assessment and clean up methods.  Organized by Dr. Danny
              D. Reible of Louisiana State University, the course will be held in Rio de
              Janeiro, Brazil, July 15-27, 2002 and will involve approximately 50 students
              and 12 leaders in the field.  Publications of the lectures and supporting
              information will be made available in audio-linked web format for the use of
              others unable to attend and participate in the PASI.
