Abstract    :
              In many important combustion applications, heat transfer is dominated by thermal
              radiation from combustion gases and soot.  Thermal radiation from combustion
              gases, even in the absence of turbulence interactions, is extremely
              complicated; accurate and efficient predictions are only now becoming possible.
               The coupling between turbulence and radiation has to date essentially been
              ignored due to their extreme complexity, although preliminary calculations have
              shown that turbulence-radiation interactions (TRI) can more than double the
              radiative loss from a flame.  Integration of finite volume and finite element
              methods, stochastic methods based on a probability density function (PDF), and
              ray tracing Monte Carlo schemes, exploiting the strengths of each method, can
              potentially produce a formidable computational tool to describe the highly
              nonlinear interaction between turbulence, chemical reactions and thermal
              radiation in turbulent flames over a broad range of conditions.  An
              interdisciplinary team of Co-PI's, together with collaborators from industry
              and national laboratories, will address these issues using an innovative
              IT-based approach.  The goal of this study is to develop modular, portable,
              scalable, parallel computational tools that address the interactions of all
              three phenomena.
