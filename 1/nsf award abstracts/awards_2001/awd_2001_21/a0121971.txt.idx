Abstract    :
                     Abstract EEC-021971 Silevitch  This project is in partnership
              between the ERC for Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems (CenSSIS) at the
              Northeastern University and the ERC for Computer-Integrates Surgical Systems
              and Technology (CISST) at the Johns Hopkins University. The common objective of
              the two collaborating groups is to develop core imaging and computer
              technologies to assist the physician in the treatment of diseases of the eye.
              The two teams will address the problem of integrating a variety of medical
              images into a common description in the form of a quantitative anatomical atlas
              of the human eye.  The research is expected to deliver an interventional tool
              to the correct area on the retina, in a manner that maximizes the dosage to the
              region of interest and minimizes the dosage to healthy areas.  The ERC at
              Northeastern University will bring its expertise in subsurface sensing, and the
              ERC at the Johns Hopkins University will contribute its expertise in steady
              hand robotics.
