              Abstract

This proposal is one part of a collaborative research effort between
              Dr. Yeung of Georgia Tech and Dr. Sreenivasan of Yale University (CTS-0121007)
              on the Reynolds and Schmidt number scalings in turbulence and turbulent mixing.
               The research will include simulations and experiments.  Dr. Yeung who has
              access to the Teraflop IBM SP at the San Diego Supercomputer Center under NPACI
              will make direct numerical simulations of the flow.  With Teraflop capability,
              simulations will be carried out at much higher resolutions than here-to-fore. 
              Dr. Sreenivasan will carry out experiments in a tunnel using cryogenic liquid
              helium or nitrogen as the working fluid, which will result in much higher
              Reynolds number flows.  The data generated at high Reynolds numbers both by DNS
              and cryogenic experiments will be used together with existing data at lower
              Reynolds numbers to test the scaling laws.  Both proposals were sent to the 
              reviewers at the same time, and they were requested to return a single
              evaluation.
