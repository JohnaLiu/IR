Abstract    :
              0121956  Huang  The objective of the proposed research is to study the role of
              black carbon and kerogen in soils on the sorption of organic pollutants.  The
              goals of this research are to: (1) develop a comprehensive chemical procedure
              for the isolation and fractionation of black carbon and kerogen, (2)
              characterize the isolated materials, (3) measure hydrophobic organic chemicals
              (HOCs) sorption and desorption for the isolated materials as well as the
              original soils, and (4) establish a predictive relationship among sorption, the
              contents and properties of black carbon and kerogen, and the properties of the
              tested HOCs.  This research could provide improved understanding of both the
              chemistry of soil organic matter and the mechanisms for the binding,
              sequestration, and attenuation of HOCs in soils.  This could have impact on our
              knowledge of contaminant fate and transport, and pollutant attenuation in the
              environment. ***
