Abstract    :
              California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State LA) and the University of
              Southern California (USC) propose to establish a Collaborative to Integrate
              Research and Education (CIRE) in the areas of controls and multimedia
              technologies.  Under this collaboration the collective strengths of the
              Structures, Pointing and Control Engineering (SPACE) laboratory-a NASA
              supported facility within the School of Engineering and Technology at Cal State
              LA-the Integrated Media Systems Center, an Engineering Research Center at
              USC-will be combined.  The major goal of the program is to increase the number
              of underrepresented minority students exposed to interdisciplinary research and
              cutting-edge technologies and prepare them for future employment and advanced
              degrees in engineering.
