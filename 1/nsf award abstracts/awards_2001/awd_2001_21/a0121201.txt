ITR/PE: Latent
              Semantic Analysis: Theory and Technology


This research program is designed
              to motivate, create and evaluate a new theory and methodology of learning, in
              which computer analysis of writing and speech is used to teach students to
              process and comprehend information more effectively.  This work will inform
              educators on instructional and assessment strategies for improved reading
              comprehension to a degree not yet present in schools today.  The methodology
              will teach students to read more effectively and to comprehend and learn more
              from what they read.  Since the methodology can be applied to any text, it can
              be incorporated into reading programs to improve reading achievement, and be
              used as an effective tool to improve achievement in science and
              mathematics.

The work is intended to achieve both theoretical and research
              breakthroughs in four areas:  (1) extend LSA to incorporate syntactic as well
              as semantic information; (2) extend the power and scope of LSA by advancing its
              conceptual and mathematical framework to include other psychological process
              models that handle phenomena such as metaphor and causal inferences; and (3)
              extend LSA to process transcriptions of natural continuous speech, enabling LSA
              to be used to teach comprehension of both read and spoken text by children who
              cannot write or type well enough to produce textual responses; and (4)
              demonstrate that these theoretical advances improve comprehension of speech and
              text by students in different grades, ethic backgrounds, and in different
              subjects.
