5th Annual Green
              Chemistry and Engineering Conference


This award supports partially the
              expenses for participation by 15 graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and
              young faculty in Fifth Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference, which
              will be held at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, DC, on June
              26-28, 2001.  The subtitle of this conference " A New Generation of
              Professionals---A New Generation of Processes".  Like its predecessor
              conferences, this meeting is organized around the Presidential Green Chemistry
              Challenge Awards and is intended to accelerate the adoption of cleaner
              processes in all sectors of industry.  In addition to presentation by award
              winners, research papers and posters on relevant topics are given.  This year's
              conference is also putting emphasis on improving education to support the
              development of clean processing.

The NSF support is given to expand exposure
              and participation of young scientists and engineering and thus to contribute to
              education and expansion of research activities in this important environmental
              area.
