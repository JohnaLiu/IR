Abstract    :
              An oceanography collection providing access to nearly 50 years of shipboard
              data, integrating historical documents, samples, research publications, and
              maps from global databases is being developed into a searchable digital
              library. This project uses modern technologies to bridge the gap between
              content-related, but disparate holdings within libraries, data archives, and
              historical archives to create a digital library that facilitates both research
              and learning. The digital library is being presented to the user as an in Ocean
              Exploration Center supporting inquiry into the history of ocean exploration as
              well as oceanographic databases. From a global map of approximately 3000
              oceanographic cruises, users are able to identify
and retrieve relevant
              materials appropriate to their interest and educational level, from photographs
              and
diaries to scientific papers and data. The maps and archival images
              provide K-12 and college educators with content and tools to communicate the
              excitement of oceanographic discovery. At the same time, students and
              researchers are able to use the site to locate and download data for further
              analysis and research.
The project is serving as a model for other fields by
              merging materials previously segregated and
accessible only to specialists and
              making them available to a broad audience.
