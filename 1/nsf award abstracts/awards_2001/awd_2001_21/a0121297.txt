Abstract    :
              The MavHome project views a smart home as an intelligent agent, which is able to
              perceive its environment through the use of sensors and act upon the
              environment through the use of actuators. The home has overall goals, such as
              minimizing the cost of maintaining the home and maximizing the comfort and
              productivity of its inhabitants. In order to meet these goals, the house must
              be able to reason about and adapt to information using knowledge about
              databases, machine learning, multiagent systems, robotics, smart sensors,
              wireless mobile computing, and multimedia computing. Smart homes can
              potentially minimize home operating costs in a time when utilities fees are
              becoming prohibitive, and can assist individuals with disabilities to lead
              independent lives.  Through the university visitor program, minority
              recruitment, course development, and dissemination of results, the project will
              impact research and education in the area of "smart space technologies."
