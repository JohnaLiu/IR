Abstract    :
              Embedded systems, such as controllers in automotive, medical, and avionic
              systems, consist of a collection of interacting software modules reacting to
              and controlling an analog environment. Engineering disciplines such as control
              theory focus on continuous dynamics, and offer foundations for designing robust
              control laws for ensuring optimal performance of dynamical systems. Computing
              disciplines such as software engineering focus on discrete programs, and offer
              structured ways of implementing complex control and analysis tools for
              validating distributed software. For networked embedded devices with multiple
              modes of operation, the combination of the complexity in both discrete and
              continuous aspects leads to  fundamental problems that are not yet well
              understood, and this makes the programming of reliable embedded systems a
              particularly challenging task.  A systematic approach to designing embedded
              devices requires combining tools from control theory and modern software
              engineering, and the emerging theory of hybrid systems---systems with tightly
              integrated  discrete and continuous dynamics, has the potential to provide the
              foundation. Despite the great appeal of hybrid systems as a model, the
              applicability of the state-of-the-art analysis and design techniques for hybrid
              systems has been limited to examples of small size due to complexity. This ITR
              research aims to develop foundations and tools for automatic abstraction and
              hierarchical decomposition as a means of simplification and scalability.  
                To facilitate high-level design of embedded software, modeling concepts
              such as hierarchy, modularity,  reuse, compositionality, and
              object-orientation, are explored to develop a theory of hierarchical hybrid
              systems with an accompanying a compositional calculus of refinement. This will
              be the basis for behavioral interfaces and descriptions of components at
              different levels of abstractions.  For rigorously specifying and evaluating
              design alternatives and correctness requirements, automated techniques such as
              model checking are very effective. To apply these techniques for formal
              analysis of hybrid systems, this research is developing automated schemes for
              constructing abstractions of hybrid models. The technical directions being
              pursued include model checking algorithms that exploit hierarchy, algorithms
              for extracting  finite-state approximations using predicate abstraction,
              counter-example guided refinement of abstractions, property-preserving
              bisimulation-based reductions of continuous differential equations, and
              assume-guarantee reasoning. The results of this research are being integrated
              in software tools for modeling and analysis of hybrid systems. The benefits of
              the techniques for developing embedded systems with higher assurance for safety
              and reliability are evaluated in an experimental testbed of multiple,
              autonomous,  mobile robots.
