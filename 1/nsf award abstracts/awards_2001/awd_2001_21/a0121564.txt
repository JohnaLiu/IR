Abstract    :
              The project will investigate the dynamical influence of the stratosphere on
              tropospheric variability in the middle and high latitudes of the Northern
              hemisphere.  Interest in stratospheric circulation, including sudden warming,
              has recently been rekindled by observational analyses which suggest that a
              primary mode of tropospheric variability in polar latitudes--the annular
              mode--is influenced by the downward migration of annular anomalies from the
              stratosphere.  Variations in stratospheric polar vortex have been linked to
              seasonal anomalies in the tropospheric zonal-mean zonal winds and circulation
              patterns such as the Arctic Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation.  These
              patterns have profound impact on European and North American climate and
              weather.  Drs. Ortland and Dunkerton will conduct a dynamically oriented
              analysis of the mechanisms coupling the troposphere and stratosphere, and the
              subtropics and midlatitudes.  The PIs will use a quasi-linear primitive
              equation model to study the interaction of zonal-mean zonal flow (annular
              component) and the planetary-scale Rossby waves.  The project will advance the
              understanding and modeling of dynamical interactions of the troposphere and
              stratosphere, and shed light on the evolution of the annular mode.  This
              research will also be helpful in understanding the mechanisms producing the
              observed climate trends.
