Abstract    :
              The Decentralized Image Retrieval for Education (DIRECT) project is developing a
              peer-to-peer content based image retrieval (CBIR) service for the National
              SMETE Digital Library program. CBIR allows the user to designate a query image
              so that the service can search the library for images of similar content.
              DIRECT matches images not by text metadata but by the color, texture, and shape
              of the image objects. With such a system the users of the NSDL do not need to
              know specialized languages to initiate a search. Furthermore, the matching
              process does not depend on a match between the cataloguer description and the
              user description. The system is available to all collections in the NSDL
              without imposing new standards or protocols. This offers the promise for the
              NSDL to support images that have not yet been cataloged or have incomplete
              metadata, without the image collection provider or aggregator having to incur
              additional cataloging overhead.
