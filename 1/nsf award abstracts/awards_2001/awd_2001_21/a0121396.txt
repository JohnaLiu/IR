Abstract    :
              Meetings are essential and ongoing processes in almost every enterprise. To
              record meetings is to provide a history of human interactions. However, two
              central challenges remain: (1) how to make sense of the group dynamics in those
              meetings and (2) how to search through a history of those interactions to find
              the information one may want. This research aims to develop automatic
              information processing systems based on the metaphor of a "meeting map", a
              structured representation that supports the presentation of multiple views of a
              meeting at different scales. The project will focus on two broad map
              categories: content maps, portraying topics discussed and decisions made; and
              interaction maps, identifying the roles and relationships of the participants
              and the level of concurrence. Building content and interaction maps will
              involve automatic classification of information from topic changes and salience
              to disagreement/consensus.  These maps will be used for generating simple
              indicative summaries, and off-the-shelf visualization tools will be used for
              map presentation.  The project will build on analyses of 100 hours of meetings.
               Evaluations will use objective recognition accuracies and expert assessments
              of automatic summaries. Meeting maps respect the diversity of information
              present in meeting scenarios, and provide effective support for human-to-human
              interactions.
