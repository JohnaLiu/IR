Abstract    :
              This project is developing a lightweight infrastructure for deploying workflow
              services into digital libraries that can be tailored to meet users' unique
              needs. Such workflow requirements typically involve multiple stakeholders
              distributed across different organizations who must coordinate their actions.
              Recent advances in event messaging systems, hypermedia, and Web-based
              technologies (such as XML), are being used to create a lightweight workflow
              technology to help the stakeholders of a digital library coordinate their
              shared activities. The technology is being designed to support a low entry
              barrier to use, multiple computing platforms, and a certain level of autonomy
              to the individual organizations that adopt it. Evaluation of the project's
              techniques and technology is being undertaken using the workflow processes of
              three "real-world" digital libraries: the Web Portal to the Scientific
              Computing Division of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, the JESSE
              electronic journal, associated with the Digital Library for Earth System
              Education, and the JIME electronic journal.
