Abstract    :
              Building on the American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) Virtual
              Library Project (http://www.communitytechnology.org/aihec_vl/), this project is
              organizing and convening two task force meetings and a larger national
              conference that will result in a plan of action for coordinating and leveraging
              the research, development, and training activities involving digital libraries
              and advanced technologies within AIHEC and the related activities evolving in
              the community of grantees of NSF's National Science, Mathematics, Engineering,
              and Technology Education Digital Library (NSDL) program.  Participants in the
              conferences will include faculty and administrators from tribal colleges,
              librarians, technology experts, experts in Native American culture and
              learning, and leaders of selected NSDL projects.  Goals of the project
              include:  -- determining and implementing strategies for making the NSDL more
              accessible, meaningful, and useful to American Indians; -- providing
              opportunities for tribal colleges to participate in and inform the NSDL during
              its early development and into the future; and -- creating and extending
              metadata and classification schemes that incorporate the cultures and views of
              various American Indians and Alaska Natives.  AIHEC is conducting the project
              in collaboration with the Alliance for Community Technology at the University
              of Michigan's School of Information, which has supported the development of the
              AIHEC Virtual Library with funding from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.
