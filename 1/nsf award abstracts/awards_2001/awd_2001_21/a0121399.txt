This proposal is being recommended as a Small
              Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to document to continuing retreat of the 
              Columbia Glacier, Alaska by rapid calving .  The Glacier is presently
              retreating at a rate of approximately 1.67 kilometers (Km) per year.  This
              rapid retreat has been accompanied by flow speeds up to 34 meters (m) per day,
              making it now the world's fastest-moving glacier.  Since 1982, the glacier
              terminus has retreated more than 12 Km since the mid-eighteenth century and
              thinned seaward (10-15 kilometers) by approximately 200 m.

Significant
              changes may be occurring in the glacier's pattern and speed of retreat during
              the next nine months as the glacier terminus passes through a gap which
              confines its flow.  The activities over the next few months may provide
              important clues about the longer-term fate of Columbia Glacier as the retreat
              progresses up the channel where the glacier bed lies below sea-level.  Recent
              calculations suggest that, depending on whether flow speeds continue at their
              present fast rate or decline moderately, the portion of the glacier grounded
              below sea level (the lowermost 25 km, with an ice volume of ca. 8 x 1010 m3)
              will be removed by flotation or calving within 5 to 20 years.

The Principal
              Investigators are continuing their analysis of photogrammetric data from 1999
              and 2000, and will submit a proposal to OPP/ANS in September 2001. However, the
              present terminus position and newly calculated subglacial topography may mean
              that that the glacier is at a critical state in its retreat, and that
              significant events may occur before the end of 2001.  The funds will allow them
              to continue the aerial photography through 2001 when important changes may
              occur as the terminus enters deeper water and passes a major lateral
              constriction.
