The goals of this project are to produce a
              computer-model which will serve as a data simulator for a new type of radio
              telescope (a 400-km, low frequency, radio telescope that will work in the
              10-240 MHz wavelength range).  The output of this computer model will be used
              to study a variety of different instrument designs as well as develop
              techniques for the post-processing data analysis.  The latter will include the
              development of a network architecture and protocol to support the data rates,
              support for dynamic range and fidelity levels that are beyond the present
              state-of-the-art, and the calibration of the ionospheric propagation delays and
              instrumental characteristics that require new techniques and algorithms.
              

The project is part of the US participation in an international
              collaboration (designated LOFAR for Low Frequency Array) which is projected for
              operation in 2006. An additional $9-10 million is being invested in the design
              by Netherlands Foundation for Research in Astronomy (NFRA, [ASTRON in Dutch])
              and the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL).  The National Academy of Sciences
              Decadal Survey of Astronomy (2001) recommended the project for NSF support. 
              This effort is a major new astronomy initiative. NSF participation will
              guarantee wide access to the instrument by the US astronomical community,
              although the primary funding will come from NRL and ASTRON.
