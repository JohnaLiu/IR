Abstract    :
              As applications enabled by the Internet become information rich, ensuring access
              to quality information in the presence of potentially malicious entities will
              be a major challenge. The goal of this research project is to develop defensive
              techniques to counter denial-of-information (DoI) attacks. Such attacks attempt
              to confuse an information system by deliberately introducing noise that appears
              to be useful information. The mere availability of information is insufficient
              if the user must find a needle in a haystack of noise that is created by an
              adversary to hide critical information. The research focuses on the
              characterization of information quality metrics that are relevant in the
              presence of DoI attacks. In particular, two complementary metrics are explored.
              Information regularity captures predictability in the patterns of information
              creation and access. The second metric,  information quality trust, captures
              the known ability of an information source to meet the needs of its clients.
              The development of techniques to derive the values of these metrics for
              information sources is a key goal of the research.  Other planned research
              activities include the building of a distributed information infrastructure and
              experimental evaluation of defensive techniques against DoI attacks.
