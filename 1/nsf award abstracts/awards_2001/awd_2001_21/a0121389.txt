The explosive growth in demand for broadband wireless data
              services has underscored the importance of low-complexity, bandwidth-efficient
              communication techniques for multipath radio channels.  Recent information
              theoretic results have demonstrated that deploying multiple antennas at both
              the transmitter and receiver can dramatically increase the capacity of wireless
              channels. In order to realize the full potential of this approach, it is
              important to develop new antenna designs and low-complexity signal processing
              techniques that more fully exploit the space-time structure of
              multi-input/multi-output radio channels.

The aim of this project is to
              improve the performance of wireless communication systems by jointly optimizing
              the antenna array geometry, coding and modulation, and receiver processing.
              Four general issues are addressed: (1) design of new antenna arrays inspired by
              information theory; (2) design of space-time constellations that achieve full
              diversity and preserve channel capacity; (3) low-complexity space-time coding
              methods based on multilevel serial concatenation; and (4) new scalable receiver
              architectures for joint iterative space-time decoding and array processing. The
              proposed research is an interdisciplinary effort in communications, signal
              processing, and RF antenna design. The ultimate goal of this work is to
              increase spectral efficiency and reduce the power requirements of wireless
              communication systems.
