              Workshop:  Complexity in Biosystems:  Innovative Approaches at the Interface of
              Experimental Modeling and Computational Simulation  This workshop focuses on
              the new research area of complex biosystems modeling and simulation, bringing
              together scientists who are developing this field along with interested
              newcomers.  It will serve to build a community of researchers across
              disciplinary boundaries in computer and mathematical sciences and biology,
              leading to a continuing collaborative working group in this area.  The workshop
              proposal requests participant support for 3 nonlocal organizers and  18 invited
              speakers, with additional participant support set aside for nonlocal graduate
              student participation.
