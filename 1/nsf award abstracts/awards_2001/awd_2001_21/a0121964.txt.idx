Abstract    :
              The sponsorship and funding of the Division of Electrical and Communication
              Systems (ECS) of NSF, is requested to partially support the International
              Semiconductor Device Research Symposium (ISDRS'Ol), December 5-7, 2001, in
              Washington DC. NSF has been a valued sponsor in the past (ISDRS'99). The
              Symposium is encouraging student participation and provides a highly
              interactive international forum for engineers, scientists, and students in the
              areas of advanced materials for devices, novel semiconductor devices, and
              processing technologies. We propose to use the funds to partially support
              student and faculty participation (partial travel reimbursement), symposium
              supplies and printing, and plenary speaker stipends. The sponsorship,
              participation and endorsement of NSF is invited.
