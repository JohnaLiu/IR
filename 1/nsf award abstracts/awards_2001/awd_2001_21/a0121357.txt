Abstract    :
              Roberto Car and Annabella Selloni of Princeton University are supported under
              the Information Technology Research Program (ITR) by the Division of Chemistry,
              the Division of Materials Research, and the Division of Advanced Computational
              Infrastructure and Research to make ab initio molecular dynamics simulations
              more effective and more accessible on high performance computing platforms. 
              Co-PI's include Josep Torrellas and Laxmikant Kale of University of Illinois,
              Michael Klein of the University of Pennsylvania, Mark Tuckerman of New York
              University, Glenn Martyna of Indiana University, and Nicholas Nystrom of
              Carnegie Mellon University (via collaborative proposals CHE-0121357,
              CHE-0121302, CHE-0121375, CHE-0121367, and CHE-0121273, respectively).  This
              team of computational chemists and computer scientists will develop new
              efficient and high accuracy methods, extensible open source software modules
              with desirable scaling properties, and novel hardware designs that will enable
              modeling of complex events and environments of interest to chemistry, materials
              science and engineering, geoscience, and biology.

Information technology
              (IT) has transformed computational science to the extent that realistic,
              atom-based simulations of key processes in chemistry, nanoscience and
              engineering, and biology can now be addressed using highly accurate
              simulations.  This research can potentially impact the design of
              polymer-generating catalysts, nanoscale electronic devices, and artificial
              biomimetic catalysts.
