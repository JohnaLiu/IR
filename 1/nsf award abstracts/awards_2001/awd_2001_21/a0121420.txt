Abstract    :
              Compact objects (neutron stars or black holes) can be found in nature
in close
              binary systems orbiting each other. Such systems are expected
to emit
              gravitational radiation of high frequency and therefore are
thought to be
              excellent source candidates for the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-wave
              Observatory (LIGO) planned to become operational in
the next couple of years.
              Theoretical studies of such astrophysical
sources of gravitational waves will
              be undertaken by the PI and a
postdoctoral fellow, and a number of questions
              will be addressed:  
(A) what is the predicted frequency with which binary
              compact objects of
interest form in our Galaxy and out to extragalactic
              distances, what
are the uncertainties of these predictions, and what do they
              imply
about gravitational-wave detection, (B) what are the
              physical
properties of these binaries (e.g., masses, eccentricities,
              spins,
velocities) and how can gravitational-wave data analysis methods
              be
optimized for their detection.

Undoubted confirmation of the existence
              of gravitational waves as
fundamentally predicted by the theory of general
              relativity can be
provided only by their direct detection, expected by
              observatories such
as LIGO. The detectability of binary compact objects
              depends on a
number of factors related both to the astrophysical properties of
              the
sources and the capabilities of the observatory. The research
              described
above will contribute to the advancement of our understanding of
              the
most promising gravitational-wave sources, optimize the relevant
              data
analysis methods, and therefore improve the detectability prospects
              for
LIGO.
