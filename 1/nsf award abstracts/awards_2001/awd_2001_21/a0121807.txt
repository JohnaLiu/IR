Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative research project between the Engineering Research Center
              (ERC) for Computational Field Simulations at the Mississippi State Univesity
              and NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and stennis space Center.  The objective
              of the research is to address the issues related to improving the quakity of
              numerical simualtions of rocket engines, both in operational and testing
              environments.  The critical science barriers will be addressed in this grant. 
              NASA will provide funds to develop the test-bed systems that will validate the
              computational and simulation results in the Ejector-Mode Rocket Based Combined
              Cycle (RBCC) engine performance and survivability studies.
