Abstract    :
              The Gender and Science Digital Library (GSDL), a collaborative project between
              the Gender and Diversities Institute at Education Development Center, Inc. and
              the Eisenhower NationalClearinghouse (ENC) at Ohio State University, seeks to
              create a high-quality, interactive library of K-16 gender and science
              resources. The GSDL assists educators in promoting and implementing
              gender-equitable science education in both formal and informal settings. This
              is accomplished by developing, piloting, and launching a cohesive collection
              focused primarily on classroom climate, curriculum, and practice, including
              copies of print materials, videos, interactive websites, and other resources.
              Focus groups with a diverse population of K-16 educators and students, and
              teacher preparation faculty and students are used in developing an intuitive
              interface that allow multiple approaches for users. These approaches are
              integrated into the existing ENC digital library structure. While the primary
              audience is K-16 science educators, teacher educators, and gender
              equity specialists, the collection is also be useful to families, community
              organizations, and to researchers, and students in post-secondary education.
              Materials for the GSDL are from the ENC and Women's Educational Equity Act
              (WEEA) Resource Center, NSF grants, and the collections of various science
              education centers and equity assistance centers. The project also aggressively
              solicits submissions through its websites, listservs, and links to equity and
              science networks and to publishers. Guidelines for submissions to assist
              publishers, or for developers to place their work into the collection are in
              place. Submissions are reviewed, catalogued and abstracted according to a
              criteria developed with our national advisors and collaborating organizations.
              The library infrastructure uses a structured, query-language relational
              database and the USMARC framework, thus aligning the GSDL with the national
              digital library system.
