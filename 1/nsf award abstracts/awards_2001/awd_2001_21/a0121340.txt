It is proposed to carry
              out experimental studies to extend our understanding of the physical mechanisms
              responsible for the instabilities in the path of rising air bubbles in a
              liquid.  Such motion is encountered in a number of industrial processes and
              geophysical phenomena.  The PI proposes to develop a novel three-dimensional
              imaging system that would allow precise measurements of the bubble trajectories
              in the neighborhood of the instability point.  Results of some preliminary
              experiments show two distinct paths of rise depending on the rising velocity. 
              It is expected that with the 3D imaging system, more accurate data will be
              obtained.
