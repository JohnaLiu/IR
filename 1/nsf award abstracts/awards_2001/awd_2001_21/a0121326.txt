ITR/PE: Interaction and
              Participation in Integrated Urban Land Use, Transportation, and Environmental
              Modeling

Patterns of land use and transportation play a critical role in
              determining the economic vitality, livability, and sustainability of urban
              areas. Transportation interacts strongly with land use: different kinds of
              transportation systems induce different patterns of land use, while at the same
              time, different kinds of land use induce demands for different kinds of
              transportation systems.  Both have significant environmental effects. This
              integrated research program will support the construction and deployment of
              sophisticated models of land use, transportation, and environmental impact. 
              The goal is to provide tools for stakeholders, such as urban planners,
              government staff, and citizens' groups, to help predict future patterns of
              urban development under different possible scenarios over periods of twenty or
              more years, allowing them to make more informed choices.  Anticipated
              scientific advances include: in human-computer interaction, more effective ways
              of understanding the results from and interacting with complex simulations, and
              ways of linking stakeholder values with design choices in simulations and their
              interfaces; in graphics, capabilities for producing simulated street-level
              animations of urban environments from a policy-driven simulation; and in
              software engineering, new software structures that allow us to design,
              integrate, and evolve complex and diverse urban submodels.
