Abstract    :
              This project is promoting wide-spread access to quality information, resources,
              and activities in support of learning, teaching, and research in the areas of
              geotechnical engineering, rock engineering, and water and its use. The effort
              is envisioned as a component of a larger national civil engineering digital
              library providing "one-stop" access to resources to meet the learning, teaching
              and research needs of a wide audience including higher education,
              professionals, and the community at large. The project expects significant
              benefits to accrue as citizens gain awareness of the importance of these areas
              of civil engineering activities in their daily lives. In formal educational
              settings a direct impact is expected on undergraduate, graduate and continuing
              education as users gain rapid access to educational resources dealing with
              cutting edge civil engineering advances. A host portal provides access to
              collections of reviewed and ranked resources in the three target areas, and
              growth of the collection is planned in other areas of civil engineering. An
              advisory panel is assisting the project in areas of user needs assessment,
              testing of learning objects, and dissemination of information about the
              project.
