Abstract    :
              This collaborative project (with personnel at the University of Maryland
              Baltimore County) is investigating the creation of a learner-centered
              metathesaurus based on the analysis of transactions between learners and two
              learning resources - the Math Forum and www.smete.org. Three modes of
              interaction are being considered. The first involves data in which many
              students respond to the same problem (the "Problem of the Week" at the Math
              Forum). The second interactional mode involves data from transactions between
              learners and experts (the Math Forum's "Ask Dr. Math" feature). The final
              interactional mode under study uses collections at a third resource,
              www.smete.org, where learner usage is more in the traditional library mode of
              search-retrieve. Additional feedback information in the form of the viewed and
              selected resources enables the construction of a map between the learners'
              language and resource metadata, which has potential to permit the extension of
              the metathesaurus across domain boundaries.
