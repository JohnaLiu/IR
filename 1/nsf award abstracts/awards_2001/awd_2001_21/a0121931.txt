This project will support a pilot program
              for a "University without Walls," including Northeastern University's ERC for
              Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems (CenSSIS), Confocal-microscopy
              Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Biomedical Research
              Partnership (BRP) Laboratory at the Massachusetts General Hospital.
              Collaboration between biomedical researchers and engineers is essential in
              creating breakthroughs in sensing an imaging that will be necessary to solve
              complex biological processes. A three-year program is proposed involving
              graduate students. Each student will have an academic advisor in the home
              institution, responsible for directing the students' academic activity, and two
              technical advisors, one in engineering an done in biology or medicine.  The
              research will focus on three areas: hyperspectral imaging, confocal microscopy
              and quadrature tomographic microscope.
