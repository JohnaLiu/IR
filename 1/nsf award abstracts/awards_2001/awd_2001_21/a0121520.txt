Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59)
This is a project to complete a promising research
              agenda focused on the assessment of engineering education and funded initially
              by the Engineering Education and Centers Action Agenda initiative (EEC
              9872498). Specifically, the critical problem of how to best assure that
              engineering students receive a quality education is being addressed through
              outcomes assessment. With the introduction of the ABET EC2000 accreditation
              criteria, engineering faculty must develop and implement systems for continuous
              improvement. 
The project is involving a multidisciplinary team from five
              universities: Colorado School of Mines, Columbia University, University of
              Pittsburgh, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, and the University of
              Washington. The objectives are to identify and evaluate a variety of
              methodologies for assessing engineering education and to provide engineering
              educators with a comprehensive set of attributes to describe student learning
              outcomes, identify existing instruments for each method to assess student
              achievement outcomes, and develop instruments where none can be found. The
              particular focus of this phase of the project is to use triangulation
              experiments using multiple assessment methodologies to measure specific
              undergraduate outcomes on student cohorts at all five institutions. The
              research is intended to determine which methods are most effective for
              particular outcomes as well as to better understand how engineering students
              progress toward achieving stated learning outcome objectives over the course of
              their undergraduate education. All findings and materials from this work will
              continue to be available at http://www.engrng.pitt.edu/~ec2000/
