Abstract    :
              This project is developing a Personalized Content Delivery System (PCDS) to
              promote and showcase NSDL materials and services, while at the same time
              collecting and disseminating information about the best new online SMET
              resources from outside the NSDL. Project objectives include: i) development of
              a set of "current awareness" services that deliver information about high
              quality, online SMET resources (from both NSDL projects and outside sources) to
              NSDL users in a fashion that best suits their needs; ii) extension and
              improvement of access to NSDL collections and services; iii) collaboration in
              the development of shared metadata across multiple disciplines; and iv)
              contribution to the overall digital library knowledge base by actively working
              with standard-setting bodies and organizations.
