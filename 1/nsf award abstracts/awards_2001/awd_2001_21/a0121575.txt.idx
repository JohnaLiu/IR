Abstract    :
              The University of Tennessee, School of Information Sciences and Center for
              Information Studies, is partnering with the Department of Energy's Office of
              Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) in this project to help
              undergraduate users recognize, access, and evaluate high quality scientific and
              technical information. The project's intent is to ameliorate the fact that
              college students, in particular lower division undergraduates, often do not
              recognize the importance of high quality scientific journal literature. Faced
              with many choices, they may opt for accessing information that is most
              convenient, rather than carefully evaluating the content and quality of the
              many digital resources available to them. The work builds on OSTI's efforts to
              enable access to scientific and technical report literature, through web-based
              services such as DOE Information Bridge and the PrePRINT Network. These
              resources are available to undergraduate users, yet they do not have components
              that will bring undergraduate science students to them. Such collections have
              great potential for undergraduate use via collaborative learning environments
              and provide testbeds for enhancing educational access to all parts of a
              national digital network of learning environments for SMET education. Focus
              groups are identifying useful search and retrieval features for undergraduates,
              graduate students, and science faculty; and selected features are being
              implemented and tested.
