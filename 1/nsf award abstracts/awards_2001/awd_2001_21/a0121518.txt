Abstract    :
              This award is establishing the Analytical Sciences Digital Library (ASDL) as a
              Collection in the NSDL. An Internet web site is being developed that
              classifies, catalogs, links and references information or discovery
material
              pertinent to innovations in curricular development and supporting resources in
              the analytical sciences. Due to the diverse and multi-disciplinary nature of
              the subject, the site is accessible to a wide audience of users, teachers,
              students, and practitioners interested in the teaching and delivery of
              educational material to improve the literacy, skills and thought processes of
              analytical scientists. Of special interest to ASDL is material pertinent to
              classroom and laboratory instruction based or inquiry-driven and problem-based
              learning. A Review Committee is assuring quality control of material submitted
              and accepted into ASDL.
