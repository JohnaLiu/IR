Abstract    :
              A 3-year program is proposed to explore the interactions of atomic oxygen with
              ice surfaces at temperatures relevant to the high-latitude summertime
              mesosphere.  In particular, experiments are proposed to quantify the loss rate
              of atomic oxygen on ice surfaces and to investigate atomic oxygen effects on
              the heterogeneous formation and growth rates of ice.  Oxygen atom recombination
              will be studied using a Knudsen cell reactor, together with laser-induced
              fluorescence and mass spectroscopic species detection.  Atomic oxygen effects
              on ice formation and growth will be investigated using a cryogenic test
              chamber, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and optical thin-film
              measurement techniques.  

The overall goal is this work is to provide
              experimental information to identify and clarify possible roles of mesospheric
              atomic oxygen in heterogeneous atmospheric chemistry and ice dynamics.  The
              results of this project will aid in interpreting measurements of oxygen-atom
              and ice-particle distributions in the high-latitude summertime mesosphere and
              will provide insight for constructing numerical models for mesospheric
              phenomena such as noctilucent clouds (NLCs) and polar mesospheric summertime
              echoes (PMSEs).
