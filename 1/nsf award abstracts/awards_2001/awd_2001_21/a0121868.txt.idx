Abstract    :
              The proposed research site will be based at the University of Illinois - Chicago
              (UIC) and the R&D activities conducted will be to address the needs of the
              construction and manufacturing industry in the area of sensors and
              nondestructive testing technologies for repair of buildings and bridges with
              composites.  The focus of the R&D activities will be development of
              technologies, manufacturing, implementation, and evaluation of the technologies
              developed.
