Abstract    :
              The PIs will develop a flexible modeling environment that they will make broadly
              available to the climate change community. This requires a radically new
              approach to the organization, development, documentation and dissemination of
              climate models. There is collaboration with Argonne National Laboratories for
              development of the open source, providing an online textbook documenting its
              use, and providing a system for collecting, testing, certifying and
              disseminating modules developed elsewhere. The system will be developed within
              the interpreted object-oriented Python language. This has been used
              successfully for a range of other scientific applications. Work under this
              award will resolve the grand-challenge mysteries facing climate science using
              coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling. A confluence of developments of physical
              understanding, numerical methods and computing power makes it feasible to
              address questions related to different epochs in the paleoclimate record. The
              work is important because it represents a testbed for novel software
              development approaches to climate modeling.
