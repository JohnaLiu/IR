Collaborative
              Research: ITR/AP: Reconstructing Complex Evolutionary
              Histories


Reconstruction of the evolutionary history of a group of
              organisms has changed the face of biology and is being used increasingly in
              drug discovery, epidemiology, and genetic engineering. Unfortunately, such
              reconstructions typically involve solving difficult optimization problems, so
              that even moderately large datasets can require months to years of computation.
               In addition, almost all evolutionary reconstructions presently assume that the
              historical pattern is one of strict divergence that can be represented by a
              binary tree.  This assumption is frequently violated, especially by plants
              which often hybridize readily and thus produce networks of
              relationships.

This project brings together computer scientists and
              biologists from two institutions to develop new models and algorithms to
              address these two problems.  Successful completion of this project will have an
              enormous impact by providing tools for reconstructing phylogenies of large
              datasets, and the first tools for inferring network models of evolution
              appropriate to hybridizing speciation.  Such network models will alter how
              biologists think about speciation, while the development of methods for
              large-scale analyses will strongly benefit medical and pharmaceutical practice.
               
Information technology will be advanced in fundamental ways as well, as the
              project will demonstrate how algorithm design and high-performance algorithm
              engineering can jointly solve very difficult discrete optimization
              problems.
