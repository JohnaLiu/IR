Abstract    :
              This research will investigate methods for automatic retrieval and analysis of
              3D models.  It will develop computational representations of 3D shape for
              which indices can be built, similarity queries can be answered efficiently,
              and interesting features can be computed robustly.  Next, it will build user
              interfaces which permit untrained users to specify shape-based queries.  This
              will include queries specified with text, 3D models, 2D sketching, and
              high-level methods based on constraints and rules.  It will combine elements
              of computer graphics, computer vision, and
              computational geometry.  Applications of shape-based query methods will
              include Internet search engines, computer-aided design, molecular biology,
              medicine, and security.  In each application the researchers will work with
              domain experts to understand the critical elements of the 3D databases and the
              challenging shape queries for which new methods are required.  For example,
              working with molecular biologists will help develop query tools for the
              Protein Data Bank to find macromolecules matching a given shape.  These
              methods will aid classification of proteins for which only low-resolution
              electron density maps are available, and aid searches for proteins matching a
              specific binding site.
