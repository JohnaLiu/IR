The primary purpose of this assignment is to assist , by way
              of technical and administrative functions, the internal management and
              inter-agency coordination of the High Latitude Dynamics Program.

Dr. Robin
              Muench of Earth & Space Research will serve at ONR Headquarters, full time,
              under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPPA) Mobility Program, as an
              Assistant Program Manager, ONR 322HL. Approximately half of his time will be
              spent on assignment at the National Science Foundation, which is providing half
              of the cost of funds for this IPA.

The period of the assignment will be for
              24 months, from 01 October 2000 to 30 September 2002, with an option to extend
              two additional years if the assignment is of continued benefit to ONR.  This
              proposed IPAP assignee is uniquely qualified and available for this
              assignment.

In assessing the relative benefits to INR and the parent
              organization of this IPA, ONR is determined to be the principal beneficiary
              because of its critical need for his expertise and agrees to pay 100% of the
              salary, fringe benefit and travel costs.  Because of its own critical need for
              the expertise provided by this IPA, the National Science Foundation by seperate
              arrangement is providing 50% of the funds required to fund this IPA.
