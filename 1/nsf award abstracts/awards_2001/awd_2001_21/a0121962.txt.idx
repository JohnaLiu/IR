Abstract    :
              Humans are incredibly skilled at visually recognizing the actions of others,
              even when the optical information portraying those actions is reduced to a
              sparse collection of light points attached to the individual's joints. In these
              "point-light" animations, accurate perception of body movements can only be
              recovered from the integration of the associated motion signals over space and
              time. Brain imaging research has disclosed that a region on the ventral bank of
              the posterior temporal sulcus (posterior STS) becomes active when people view
              human activity portrayed by these point-light animations. This project will
              examine the relationship between activity levels in posterior STS and the
              quality of the perceptual experience associated with viewing biological motion.
              Observers will view single trials of biological motion animations that range in
              coherence from completely biological to completely scrambled and will rate them
              according to perceived coherence. The experiments will also examine the extent
              to which posterior STS is specialized for whole-body human movement. Measures
              of neural activity will be taken as observers view point-light animations of
              animal motion, hand movements and face movements.  Finally, the anatomical
              location of posterior STS is quite near neural areas involved in auditory
              perception. If posterior STS lies within multi-modal cortical areas, then
              measures will be made of the extent to which neural signals originating from
              STS can be modulated by congruent versus incongruent auditory and visual
              events.
