ITR/AP+IM: Poseidon- Rapid
              Real-Time Interdisciplinary Ocean Forecasting: Adaptive Sampling and Adaptive
              Modeling in a Distributed Environment



Progress in understanding the
              complex coupled physics, biology and acoustics of the oceans is accelerating
              via research on realistic nonlinear multiscale interdisciplinary processes,
              interactions and variabilities.

To cope with the variabilities of such
              economies in space and time, dynamical model structures must evolve during the
              prediction, i.e., by adaptive modeling.  The objective of this project is to
              enable by an effective union of information technologies and ocean sciences,
              efficient mulitscale interdisciplinary ocean prediction with real-time
              objective adaptive sampling, assimilation of multiple streams of
              interdisciplinary data, and autonomous adaptive modeling
