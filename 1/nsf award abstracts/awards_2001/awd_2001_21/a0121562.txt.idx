Abstract    :
              Electronic markets are emerging as a primary medium of trade in
              business-to-business, business-to-consumer, and consumer-to-consumer settings.
              In order to design viable electronic marketplaces, a host of novel interrelated
              game-theoretic and computational issues must be addressed.  With a team of
              interdisciplinary researchers from multiple institutions, this project will
              develop a unified theory of games and computing to guide and facilitate the
              growth of such markets. Specific research directions of the project include the
              following: (1) Market designs will be generalized to incorporate combinatorial
              bidding, multi-attribute preferences, multi-stage mechanisms, continuous
              mechanisms, and multi-unit sale; (2) New algorithms for clearing, quoting,
              incentive-compatible pricing as well as new incentive-compatible tractable
              mechanisms will be designed with particular emphasis on online and incremental
              updating of market states; (3) Bounded rationality of the agents will be
              investigated under a wide spectrum of models of computations, equilibrium
              concepts of game theory, and trade-offs between centers and agents; and (4)
              Novel approaches to relaxing the classic common prior assumption will be
              explored in order to develop practically useful models for ecommerce. The
              successful completion of this project will make significant contributions to
              both theory and practice in the areas of electronic commerce, multi-agent
              systems, algorithms, computational complexity theory, and game theory.
