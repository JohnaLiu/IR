Abstract    :
              In the proposed project, the nonlinear vibration of rotating disks, induced by
              fluid-structure interaction, is investigated because rotating disks are
              extensively used as computer disk drives, turbine disks, automotive disk
              brakes, and circular machine tools and saws. The objectives of this project are
              to develop an accurate mathematical model to describe such a nonlinear
              vibration of rotating disks, and to further determine the corresponding
              stability for a better understanding of nonlinear dynamics for these
              fluid-structural systems and the development of control strategies for
              vibration and instability suppression. 

To solve the aforementioned problem,
              the Galerkin method and perturbation approach are used for the reduction of the
              vibration problem to a dynamical system, and the bifurcation and stability
              theories in nonlinear dynamical systems are used for obtaining the stability
              conditions.  The work plan includes: the vibration model for disks rotating on
              the air film close to the rigid wall is developed; the steady state response
              and stability and bifurcation conditions are obtained, and numerical
              simulations are completed; and the achieved results and further research
              directions in this area are summarized.

The impact and significance of this
              research include that the approaches and methodology, and results achieved in
              this research are applicable for other problems in nonlinear fluid-structure
              interaction. Additionally the proposed understanding of harmonic vibration,
              stability and solitary waves in a disk rotating on the air film will bring an
              improvement of hard-disk drive technology
