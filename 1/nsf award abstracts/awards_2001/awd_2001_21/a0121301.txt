Abstract    :
              This NSF-CBMS Regional Conference in the Mathematical Sciences on  `Numerical
              Methods in Forward and Inverse Electromagnetic Scattering' at the Department of
              Mathematical and Computer Sciences, Colorado School of Mines  will be held June
              3 to June 7, 2002.  The principal lecturer will be Professor Peter Monk of the
              Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Delaware.  The theme
              of his ten lectures will be Maxwell's equations, and methods for their
              solution. This classical topic still offers many challenges today,
especially
              as the need to solve Maxwell's equations has increased rapidly in recent years
              with applications including electromagnetic compatibility testing (to ensure
              different components like a car generator and
electronic control unit do not
              interfere with one another) and safety (for example predicting the effects of
              cell phones on users), as well as familiar applications such as radar. 
              

Topics covered will include: variational methods for cavity problems;
              finite elements and their application to cavity problems; coupling between
              finite elements and boundary integral equations; perfectly matched layers;
              adaptive methods; and methods for solving various inverse problems, such as
              locating obstacles.
