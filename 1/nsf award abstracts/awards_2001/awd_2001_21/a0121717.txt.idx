Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative project with Award No. 0121543 (Syracuse University;
              Elizabeth D. Liddy, Principal Investigator).  Researchers at the University of
              Washington's Information School and Syracuse University's Center for Natural
              Language Processing are leading this effort, with assistance from Mid-continent
              Research for Education and Learning (McREL) and Achieve, Inc.  The
              investigators are developing a natural language processing tool
              ("StandardConnection") for the automatic assignment of content standards and
              benchmarks to educational resources in the collections of the National Science,
              Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Education Digital Library (NSDL) and
              to other educational resources on the Web.  The standards and benchmarks come
              from the Compendium of Standards and Benchmarks developed by McREL, and the
              Achieve Standards Database.  Supplementing general descriptive metadata, the
              content standards metadata generated by the StandardConnection tool will make
              it possible for a teacher in any state to use the NSDL to locate appropriate
              teaching resources for helping students achieve a particular competency set by
              the state.  The project entails acquiring a "training" and "testing"
              collection of educational resources for analysis; cultivating a sophisticated
              level of understanding of the human cognitive processes involved in manually
              assigning content standard metadata tags to resources; designing and developing
              the technology based on this understanding; running the StandardConnection tool
              on an unseen set of data; analyzing the results and adjusting the tool, through
              iterations, until a highly reliable tagging is produced; and employing a group
              of teacher-experts to analyze the quality of the tool's mappings of resources
              to standards and benchmarks.  This project constitutes a logical extension of
              work conducted under Award Nos. 0085837 and 0085838, "Breaking the Metadata
              Generation Bottleneck," in which the investigators are processing the text of
              educational resources to automatically assign Gateway to Educational Materials
              (GEM) metatags for the descriptive and subject aspects of educational
              resources.
