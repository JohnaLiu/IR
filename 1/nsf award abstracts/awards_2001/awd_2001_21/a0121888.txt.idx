Abstract    :
              0121888 Kenkre  This Pan American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award,
              jointly supported by NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will take place in
              Bariloche, Argentina in the spring of 2002, on the topic of modern challenges
              in statistical mechanics and its applications.  Organized by Dr. V.M. Kenkre of
              the University of New Mexico, the institute will bring scientists from several
              fields together to conduct an intensive school for students from the U.S and
              Latin America focused on two major areas: nonlinear phenomena and pattern
              formation in biology, and the validity of the methodology of statistical
              mechanics for complex fluids.  A third focus area on modern computational
              methods in statistical mechanics will serve as general support for the other
              two.  The subjects discussed will center around current areas of much
              activity in statistical mechanics, in particular: in the formation of patterns,
              the role of noise in inducing order as well as disorder, and applications and
              implications of statistical mechanics to complex systems in biology, chemistry,
              physics, engineering, and other contexts.  Dissemination of this PASI will be
              accomplished by publishing the proceedings of the school in book form.
