Abstract    :
              EIA-0121687 Rzhetsky, Andrey Columbia University  ITR/IM+AP: Automated
              compilation and computational analysis of regulatory networks     This
              project will provide advanced information management systems as well as
              software applications relevant to the fields of bioinformaticis, molecular
              biology, and medicine.  It will contribute to fundamental Information
              Management by developing advanced algorithms for the efficient retrieval of
              information about biological pathways from research articles (using natural
              language processing techniques), machine-learning-assisted data mining in
              biological texts, and information management via a uniquely designed database
              with two levels of representation of biological information.  The specific
              aims of the project are the following:  to implement and test natural language
              processing techniques for the automatic retrieval of signal-transduction
              pathways from the research literature; to develop general and portable
              text-mining techniques for the automatic recognition of genes, proteins, and
              other domain terms, and of relationships between them; and to develop a
              mathematical framework for the statistical analysis of heterogeneous data on
              regulatory pathways.
