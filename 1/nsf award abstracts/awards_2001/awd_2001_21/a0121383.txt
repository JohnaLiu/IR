Abstract    :
              Ponnuswamy Sadayappan of Ohio State is supported by the Chemistry Division under
              the Information Technology Research (ITR) program to develop program synthesis
              tools that will facilitate high-performance parallel programming for electronic
              structure calculations.  Co-PI's include Gerald Baumgartner and Russ Pitzer of
              Ohio State, Jagannathan Ramanujam of Louisiana State, and Marcel Nooijen of
              Princeton, (the latter two via collaborative proposals CHE-0121706 and
              CHE-0121383).  This team of computer scientists and computational chemists will
              develop a tensor contraction engine that can synthesize efficient parallel code
              in Fortran or C from an input specification expressed in a high-level notation,
              for a number of target architectures.  This tool will be made freely available
              to other developers of quantum chemistry software.

The development of
              high-performance parallel programs for scientific applications is complicated
              by the effects of algorithm choice on memory access costs and communication
              overhead.  Currently available tools for software development and performance
              modeling/optimization do not provide adequate support to developers of
              scientific code.  This research will provide a novel approach to the automated
              synthesis of high-performance parallel programs, with the particular emphasis
              on electronic structure codes widely employed in chemistry, physics, and
              materials science.
