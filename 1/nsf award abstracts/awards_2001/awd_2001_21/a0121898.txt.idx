Abstract    :
              0121898  Valocchi  The objective of the proposed research is to improve
              fundamental understanding of reactive transport with the ultimate application
              to remediation processes and the management and regulation of hazardous waste
              sites.  A particular goal is to determine the effects of pore-scale mixing on
              reactive transport.  The specific objectives of this research are to: (1)
              determine the effects of local velocity, pore geometry, and reaction rate
              constant on the extent of reaction in a homogenous pore network, (2) determine
              the effects of local velocity, pore geometry, and reaction rate constant on the
              extent of reaction in heterogeneous pore networks, and (3) develop
              relationships that allow the effects of pore scale-mixing on reactive transport
              to be accounted for at the continuum-scale.  A combination of micromodel
              experiments and Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) simulations will be used to quantify
              these phenomena.  The LB method is a kinetic theory-based numerical technique
              for solving hydrodynamic and diffusive transport problems in complex pore
              structures. ***
