Abstract    :
              0121911 Uhlmann  This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award,
              jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), aims to bring
              many of the developments of the last 20 years or so in the mathematical theory
              of inverse problems to advanced graduate students, postdocs, and other
              scientists in the Americas interested in the topic and its applications.  The
              PASI, organized by Dr. Gunther Uhlmann of the University of Washington, will be
              held at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California
              from October 29 to November 2, 2001.  This PASI will be followed by a
              MSRI-organized workshop on Inverse Problems and Applications at the same site,
              thus allowing some of the participants and lecturers to attend both events. 
              The emphasis of the PASI will be on open problems in the field but also on
              promoting international collaborations by bringing experts in different areas
              together in one event.  Approximately 25 participants will be expected, from
              various countries in the Americas.
