Abstract    :
              This project is collecting solid earth science data sets and complementing them
              with a system of easy-to-use, interactive user tools to provide a dynamic and
              engaging learning environment for students at all levels ranging from K-12, to
              undergraduate, graduate, and lifelong learners. In addition, evaluation of the
              system for use in undergraduate and high school classes is underway. Through
              this project a unique digital library environment is created for users to
              interactively study the same data sets that earth science researchers are
              utilizing to learn about the dynamics of the planet, and how changes in the
              earth system affect daily life. In addition, collaboration with the staff of
              the Cornell University libraries enables the investigation of the requirements
              needed to maintain a persistent digital collection. Partial co-funding for this
              project is being provided by the Division of Earth Sciences in NSF's
              Geosciences Directorate.
