Abstract    :
              This research examines electronic market mechanisms as a means of coordination
              and communication in the industrial supply chain.  The research focuses on two
              main components: (1) innovative market mechanisms (exploring the theoretical
              and computational foundations for electronic market intermediaries in the
              supply chain, thereby deriving market mechanisms beyond price determination to
              include activity, resource, and structural coordination), and (2) focused
              industry survey (understanding the economic realities and key development
              trends in the industry by conducting in-depth field studies and empirical
              analyses). Insights developed from the research will lead to the development of
              efficient market mechanisms for supply chain coordination, and versatile market
              analysis tools. 

This research will extend the current literature in market
              microstructures, mechanism design, and supply chain coordination by (1)
              exploring the synergy between game theory, optimization, and computational
              economics approaches, (2) examining the roles of intermediaries in emerging
              supply chain markets, and their implications to market efficiency, and (3)
              suggesting engineering methodologies that convert market insights into
              implementable market instruments (e.g., contracts, protocols) and monitoring
              tools. The industry survey, to be conducted with McKinsey & Company, will
              document and classify emerging e-supply chain practices, and identify key
              issues relating to supply chain strategy in different industry sectors.
