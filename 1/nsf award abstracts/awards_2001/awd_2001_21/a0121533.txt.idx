Abstract    :
              This is a research project in the design and implementation of novel Human
              Computer Interfaces for educational use in structural molecular biology.  This
              project will explore, define, and assess the role of computer-generated
              physical models in teaching scientific content and concepts.  The purpose is to
              enhance the understanding and communication of the complex world of life's
              molecular machinery to a broad community.  Using structural data on biological
              molecules and their complexes, the participants will prototype novel physical
              models via automated design and fabrication technologies and develop
              replication processes for broader distribution.  The models will be used
              directly for enhance visualization and as input/output devices that
              interactively integrate with commutation and computer graphics for information
              retrieval, manipulation, and simulation.  This project will provide new,
              tangible modes of interacting with, and understanding of, both the fundamental
              concepts and the complex data that are coming from the rapid advances in
              genomics, proteomics, and other areas of structural molecular biology.  It will
              enable a broad range of students to learn, query, and explore in a field of
              growing scientific and social importance - the molecular basis of life. 
              Physical models will give both haptic and visual support of the importance of
              shape in biological function.  Use of physical models as tangible computer
              interfaces will revolutionize how students explore and understand biomolecular
              structure, interaction, and function.
