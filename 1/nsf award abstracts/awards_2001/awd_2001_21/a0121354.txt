Characterization of propagation in the near THz band has
              been limited to scalar absorption measurements having low spectral resolution. 
              As with cellular and PCS bands, this level of knowledge is grossly inadequate
              to assess communication system performance and design.  The PIs will perform
              initial measurements and modeling of transmission, multipath scattering, and
              fading effects in the near-THz band to set the stage for a more comprehensive
              proposal and effort to develop communications techniques that exploit the
              unique and substantial opportunity this band offers.  The proposed measurements
              will help them identify suitable environments and ranges for communication
              using the near THz band.  They also expect to gain insight on the nature of
              transmitter and receiver structures that will be required to obtain acceptable
              performance.
