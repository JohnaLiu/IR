              ABSTRACT
Geosciences in Alaska
Field Explorations and Research for K-12
              Teachers

"Geosciences in Alaska" is a collaborative project among the
              University of Alaska Museum, the University of California Museum of
              Paleontology, and the West Contra Costa Unified School District. It provides a
              professional development opportunity for teachers that combines both field and
              research experiences and evaluates the impact of these experiences on their
              teaching. 
Working with faculty and staff associated with the University of
              Alaska Museum and the University of California Museum of Paleontology, teachers
              participate in an introductory local field trip, and four weeks of field
              experience in Alaska, followed by an additional excursion locally in which they
              will apply what they have learned. This comparison between two distinct yet
              similar geological settings, Alaska and California, reinforces the major
              concepts learned and allows for a better understanding of the Earth as a
              dynamic system. Using an inquiry-based approach, the field and research
              experiences focus on geologic processes, evidence for tectonics, and
              paleontology. Following the field experiences, teachers work with one another
              and their mentors throughout the school year to incorporate what they have
              learned into their classrooms, develop a rigorous course of study in the
              geosciences for the district, and expand the project to reach a total of 60
              teachers.
