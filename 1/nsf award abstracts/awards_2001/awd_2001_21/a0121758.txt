Abstract    :
              The Rustbelt RNA Meeting will be held November 2-3, 2001,  in the Lodge at Deer
              Creek State Park in Mt.Sterling,Ohio.The Rustbelt RNA Meeting (RRM)is the only
              major Midwest regional meeting of RNA researchers. Approximately 100
              participants are expected.  The Rustbelt RNA Meeting was originally envisioned
              by Drs.Dan Schoenberg, Chris Milcarek and Tim Nilson, among others ,to address
              the needs of Midwestern RNA researchers for a regional meeting.  A need was
              perceived for a meeting venue that would include not only faculty,but also
              postdoctoral researchers and students, in a location readily accessible to
              universities in the area bounded by Cleveland, Columbus and Pittsburgh.The
              geographical scope was later expanded to include researchers from neighboring
              states because of their enthusiasm for the idea.  The objective of the RRM is
              to provide an inexpensive, high caliber, interdisciplinary regional meeting for
              RNA researchers in the Midwest.  An emphasis is placed on participation by
              undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral trainees such that in the previous two
              years trainees made up 75-80% of the attendees and gave 80-85% of the
              presentations.The RRM has also attracted and served young independent
              investigators as a place to showcase their emerging research program.  For each
              of the past two years approximately a third of the attending PI's were junior
              faculty. The meeting is open to principal investigators, postdoctoral fellows,
              graduate and undergraduate students who are interested in the broad
              interdisciplinary field of RNA research.
The meeting format is designed to
              foster interaction between trainees at the participating institutions with each
              other and with the participating principal investigators.
