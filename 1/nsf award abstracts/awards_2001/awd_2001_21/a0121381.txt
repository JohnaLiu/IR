Abstract    :
              A group of Mechanical Engineering Department Heads proposes to hold a 2-day
              workshop to develop new ideas by which to broaden the basis upon which
              mechanical engineering profession has relied.  The goal of the workshop is the
              redefine the field of mechanical engineering by increasing the breadth of
              mechanical engineering from one that is traditionally based on physics to one
              that is based also on other fields of science and engineering, such as
              biological sciences, information technology, material science, and
              medicine.

The changing nature of engineering, one that no longer has clear
              demarcations or boundaries with other disciplines and technologies, requires
              new emphasis in mechanical engineering on areas of research and education that
              have not been considered as part of the traditional discipline.

The
              objective of the workshop is to explore ways by which we can make mechanical
              engineering education and research more responsive to the changes in other
              technologies and disciplines, and also make it more attractive to the best and
              the brightest, including women and traditionally underrepresented, groups of
              students and faculty.
