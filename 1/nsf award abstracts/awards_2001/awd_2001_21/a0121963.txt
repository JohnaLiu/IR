Abstract    :
              Orographic precipitation is important both economically and from a public safety
              (flash flooding) standpoint.  In this research, the Principal Investigator will
              investigate the physical processes that control orographic precipitation.  Four
              questions to be addressed:

1. What are the relative contributions of
              coalescence and riming to accretional growth of precipitation in storms that
              extend several km above the freezing level?
2. Is there a significant
              difference in precipitation growth due to coalescence between storms that do
              and do not extend above the freezing level?
3. What is the size distribution
              of and spacing between precipitating convective elements that contribute to the
              observed small-scale variability of precipitation?
4. Is there a significant
              difference in the characteristics of the raindrop size distribution within
              fallstreaks and between fallstreaks?

The study will be observationally based
              and will utilize data collected from two completed field programs - the
              Mesoscale Alpine Programme and the Pacific Landfalling Jets Experiment. 
              

The answers to the above questions will contribute to improvement of
              parameterized and explicit descriptions of cloud microphysics within numerical
              models of orographic precipitation and to better characterization of sampling
              and beam filling errors for satellite remote sensing applications.
