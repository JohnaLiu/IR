Abstract    :
              This project will develop a social intelligence capability for computers, for
              use in educational software applications. Social intelligence plays a critical
              role in human tutoring and teaching.  By modeling social intelligence in
              software it should be possible to create educational software that is aware of
              the learners' attitudes, that interacts harmoniously and responds to learner
              needs, that is able to develop rapport with learners, and that uses
              responsiveness and rapport to influence learner motivation. This could be
              
particularly valuable for learners who have motivational problems such as low
              self-confidence.  The social intelligence model will be realized in an animated
              pedagogical agent, that uses a combination of speech and nonverbal gestures,
              that can express emotions and attitudes, and that reacts to and adapts to
              learners over time.  It will respond to a variety of learner inputs, including
              learner performance on assigned problems, conversational dialog, and eye gaze
              and facial expressions recognized using computer vision techniques. The model
              will be applied in the context of the Virtual Factory Teaching System, a
              simulation-based learning system for teaching industrial engineering
              
concepts.  The effectiveness of the model will be tested by comparing learner
              performance with and without the assistance of a socially intelligent
              agent.
