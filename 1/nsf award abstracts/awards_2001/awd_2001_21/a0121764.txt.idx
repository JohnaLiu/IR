Abstract    :
              This project brings together a diverse array of scholars from around the
              country, including computer scientists, 3D modellers and animators, theater
              practioners, and theater and music historians. The objective is to use digital
              technology to address a problem fundamental to performance scholarship and
              pedagogy: how to represent and communicate the phenomenon of live performance
              using media. This problem becomes especially pressing when the objective is to
              represent a performance tradition from the past. Neither a written description
              nor a filmed recreation is capable of conveying the experience of attending a
              live performance, an experience that encompasses not only the way the
              performance on stage looks and sounds from the perspective of spectators in
              different parts of the theatre, but also spectator's perceptions of and
              interactions with one another.  Our proposed solution to this problem is to
              recreate historical performances in a virtual reality environment. The central
              objective is to simulate a feeling of "liveness" in this environment: the
              sensation of being surrounded by human activity onstage, in the audience and
              backstage, and the ability to choose where to look at any given time
              (onstage or off) and to move within the environment. With respect to the
              performers themselves, a critical concern is to find a way to bring the
              nuances of great stage performances into the virtual environment. To this
              end, we propose to use motion capture technology to capture real-world
              performances by professional, highly skilled actors, singers, dancers,
              acrobats and musicians.  Key to our project is the depth of the proposed
              collaboration between technology, scholarship, pedagogy and art. This project
              is conceived to make a significant contribution to all four domains
              simultaneously, rather than merely using any one in the service of the others.
              The end result will represent an important advance in the design and
              implementation of virtual environments, building on recent successes in
              creating photo-realistic simulations of real 3D environments. The scale of
              this simulation, and in particular the complexity and precision of the
              character animation, pose an important technical challenge: how to integrate
              the complex pre-defined motion capture-generated animations of the onstage
              performances with the autonomous behaviors of characters in the audience and
              backstage.The project also constitute an invaluable work of applied
              scholarship, an unprecedented resource for visualizing past performances and
              testing hypotheses about historical performance practices. It will provide an
              unprecedented resource for students to engage with historical
              performance traditions as performance (and not as literature or film).
              Finally, from an artistic perspective, the Virtual Vaudeville project will
              test the potential of virtual environments to provide truly
              high-quality theater experiences to remote audiences. ~
