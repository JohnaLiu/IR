Abstract    :
              This research will focus on the interplay between molecular biology, computer
              science, and evolution to probe a complex form of biological information
              processing: gene unscrambling in hypotrichous ciliates.  The long term goal is
              to develop a multidisciplinary approach to this problem that will enable us to
              tap into this biological process as a computational tool.  The proposed
              research combines three approaches that first improve our understanding of the
              function, mechanism and logic of this phenomenon.  Specifically, this proposal
              uses gene unscrambling as a model system to explore the mechanisms underlying
              complex gene rearrangements in ciliates the steps through which these processes
              have evolved, and their capacity to solve hard computational problems in vivo. 
              The impact of the award would be an influx of new ideas and direction from
              computational sciences into the study of a complex biological system involving
              programmed genome rearrangements in ciliated protozoa, with the ultimate goal
              of harnessing the process for the purpose of performing in vivo computation.
