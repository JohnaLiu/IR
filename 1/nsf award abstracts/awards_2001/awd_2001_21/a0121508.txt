Abstract    :
              This conference grant will conduct and document a conference that brings
              together teams from the eight NSF funded Implementation and Dissemination
              Centers and key leaders from curriculum development projects, to share "lessons
              learned" as they have made efforts to increase the use of research-based
              curricula across the country.  These are relatively new projects and there is
              great interest in them as possible vehicles for assistance to states and school
              districts.  The conference, to be held in July 2001, is therefore extremely
              timely.

A white paper will be produced that captures successful approaches
              and strategies.  This paper will be helpful to the field in providing
              documentation about successful and promising approaches to implementing
              curriculum reform.
