Abstract    :
              The basic theoretical and empirical foci are the social impacts of information
              and communications technologies, especially the wired and wireless Internet, on
              individuals' social and work lives in four institutional contexts-households,
              workplaces, governments, and schools - and on the four institutions themselves.
              The analyses are integrated by an interest in the ways in which ITs create
              "information networks" which enable individuals and work groups to engage in
              multiple functions from a particular contextual location and possibly to link
              these functions and these social institutions in novel ways. The project is
              grounded in the analysis of data gathered in field studies and in longitudinal
              surveys of more than 4,000 individuals in household, workplace and school
              samples from 16 localities distributed across the four U.S. regions. These
              systematic, empirical analyses will advance our scientific understanding of how
              IT use affects individuals across multiple roles within these networked
              institutions and will inform explanatory theories of IT-related change and
              transformation at the individual and organizational levels of analysis.
