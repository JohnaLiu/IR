Partial travel support is
              requested for the U.S. academic speakers at the IBM Almaden Laboratory workshop
              on "Grand Challenges of Nanotechnology" to be organized on April 23-25 in San
              Jose, California.  The main purpose of the meeting is to develop a set of
              scientific and technological challenge issues for the future development of
              nanotechnology.  The deliberations and conclusions will be made available to
              the scientific and engineering communities and to the interested government
              agencies.  The workshop will bring together leading senior and young scientists
              from academe, industry and government from U.S. and several invited leading
              experts from abroad.  A group of young scientists will be invited to
              participate at the workshop based on nominations received from the community at
              large.  The information collected at the meeting will help community to guide
              the research in the most rewarding area, help industry and government agencies
              in setting up their priorities.  The IBM Journal or Research and Development
              will publish a selected number of contributions.  The speakers will address
              issues related to the scope of various grand challenges and the way to solve
              them, the role of technology, their implications, and the priority in funding
              future R&D projects.
