Abstract    :
              This is a study of fuel-doped flames designed to identify possible chemical
              mechanisms responsible for the formation and destruction of toxic hydrocarbons
              and soot in coflow nonpremixed flames of practical fuel components.  The basic
              methodology is to study flames that are perturbed by doping the fuel in
              systematic ways to address specific mechanistic issues related to the formation
              of small aromatics.  This strategy allows perturbation analysis, which offers
              mechanistic insight and model discrimination for systems with many coupled
              unknowns.  Hydrocarbons, such as two-ring aromatics, branched aromatics, large
              linear or cyclic hydrocarbons, and other compounds typically found in liquid
              fuels, are doped into methane used as a fuel in an air nonpremixed coflowing
              flame, and profiles of intermediate and product hydrocarbons are measured. 
              Hydrocarbons are measured with an on-line single-photon
              photoionization/time-of-flight mass sprectrometer.   Small species are measured
              with electron-impact mass spectroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence, and
              resonantly enhanced multiphoton ionization, temperature with thermocouples, and
              soot with laser-induced incandescence.
