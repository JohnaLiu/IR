Abstract    :
              Optimization is the science that integrates information into a mathematical
              model whose solution yields optimal decisions.  It has developed into a
              scientific discipline with useful applications, which are routinely used in
              industry.  However, there are many real optimization problems for which
              solutions are not known. For example, suppose a snowstorm is approaching
              Chicago.  At its operations center, an airline is reacting by making plans to
              cancel and reroute flights.  Substantial information on weather forecasts,
              plane and crew status, passenger itineraries, and hotels is available to make
              an optimal plan.  However, this information is typically not exploited to its
              fullest extent.  Why is this the case, especially as the airline is a very
              sophisticated user of optimization for planning?  Because the application is a
              large-scale stochastic combinatorial optimization problem for which there is no
              known algorithm producing good solutions in reasonable time.

This project
              aims to carry out fundamental research in this relatively new area of science
              to obtain good solutions to these problems.  It will investigate two
              complementary areas:  (1) the integration of constraint and integer programming
              that provide orthogonal strengths in approaching stochastic combinatorial
              optimization problems; and (2) stochastic substructures to design efficient
              solutions or approximations for typical instances.  This research will advance
              our knowledge about large-scale stochastic combinatorial optimization problems
              and allow for their solutions to be used in complex and critical operations.
