Abstract    :
              Mechanisms allow individuals with dispersed information to achieve desired group
              outcomes.  Experiments confirm theoretical predictions that different parameter
              values and different mechanism rules can have important effects on the
              efficiency of outcomes and the speed of convergence. A computer-based
              behavioral model will be developed to test a wide range of mechanisms and
              institutions.  The model is to be based on evolutionary algorithms.  Each smart
              agent has a collection of different strategies to use in its decision-making
              processes. Strategies compete for the right to make agent decisions through a
              selection process based on an evaluation of each strategy's hypothetical and
              actual performance. The model will first be tuned with mechanisms for which
              there are significant experimental data.  Examples include the Groves-Ledyard
              mechanism, the voluntary contribution mechanism for public goods, the double
              auction, and simultaneous trading in a set of parallel markets. Then the model
              will be used to make predictions about behavior under those mechanisms that
              have not already been tested in experiments with human subjects. This project
              will develop a new methodology for economics research that has potential to be
              better, faster, and cheaper than experimental economics.
