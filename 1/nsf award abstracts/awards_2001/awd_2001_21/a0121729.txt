Abstract    :
              Geometric Graph Theory is a new discipline at the borderline of discrete
              mathematics and theoretical computer science which has been developed to deal
              with the fundamental problems that arise from the drawings of graphs.  During
              the past 10 years Geometric Graph Theory has been effectively used to settle
              several important problems in combinatorial and computational geometry.

An
              NSF-CBMS Regional Research Conference titled "Geometric Graph Theory" will be
              held at the University of North Texas in Denton from May 28, 2002 through June
              1, 2002.  Professor Janos Pach, a leading authority in this area, will be the
              principal lecturer.

We expect that the conference will attract advanced
              researchers, as well as beginners and graduate students in all areas of
              discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science.
