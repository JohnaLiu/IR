Abstract    :
              Brain imaging using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a rapidly
              growing research discipline which utilizes technology for basic research
              investigation that was originally developed for clinical medicine. There are
              serious safety challenges related to expanding basic research fMRI. These are
              related to the rapid training of many non-medically trained investigators
              joining the field; codifying the knowledge of best practices that is not easily
              available; providing targeted safety training for non-medical MR researchers;
              dealing with special safety issues in research fMRI; addressing differences
              between FDA regulations and current practices; assisting Institutional Review
              Boards in handling detailed technical oversight; and evaluating liability
              exposure of research procedures. A working group of investigators, regulators,
              and vendors will identify the problems, and plan methods for effectively
              addressing these problems.

Specific objectives of the workshop are: 1) to
              bring together members of the basic research, clinical, regulatory (FDA), and
              vendor communities to identify the risks, precautions, and good practices that
              should be applied to basic research fMRI imaging procedures; 2) evaluate
              potential programs that might be initiated to improve the level of safety and
              quality of imaging done by basic researchers; 3) devise model practices or
              guidelines for the training of non-medical basic researchers in the areas of
              patient screening, operating in a magnet, equipment evaluation, scanner
              operation, use of equipment, and pulse sequence selection; 4) create guidelines
              for stand-alone MR centers regarding participant safety and responsibility
              procedures; 5) review existing regulations and practices to determine how they
              relate to basic research MRI neuroimaging and evaluate the advisability of
              changes in those regulations; 6) create a plan for production of materials that
              could be distributed to improve MR training of new basic researchers for
              fMRI-based research and a plan to encourage adoption of safety guidelines for
              fMRI- based research; 7) review materials developed following the workshop for
              distribution via the worldwide web; and 8) present materials regarding the
              recommendations at major society and researcher meetings.

The two-day
              workshop will be held in Pittsburgh, PA.
