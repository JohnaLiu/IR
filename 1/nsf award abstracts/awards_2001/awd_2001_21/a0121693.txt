This project involves a 3-year interdisciplinary effort to
              build on new advances in information technology to develop an adaptive
              real-time system for active management, processing, modeling and visualization
              of environmental and geoscience data.  The P.I.s will develop a set of
              real-time, integrated data base management and field data acquisition tools for
              rapid and adaptive assessment of the various phenomena following and during
              major catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, and floods.
              The P.I.'s interest is in real-time integration of the incoming information
              such that predictive models of expected site and structure response are
              continuously updated.  Specifically, the P.I.s will integrate their efforts in
              the following areas:  a) development of GIS databases capable of real time
              updating with multiple streams of information;  b) adaptive digital field data
              acquisition/mapping; c) development of robust, low cost, intelligent field
              instrumentation capable of real time data transmission (MOTEs); and d) data
              visualization and adaptive modeling of the observed phenomena.
