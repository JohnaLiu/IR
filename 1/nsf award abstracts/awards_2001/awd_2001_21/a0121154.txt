We propose to develop a
              theoretically well-founded framework for the
design and analysis of algorithms
              for large scale dynamic networks.
In particular, for the Web and related
              dynamic networks, such as 
the underlying Internet topology
              and
Internet-based peer to peer ad hoc networks. We plan to develop 
rigorous
              mathematical models that capture key
characteristics and can make reliable
              predictions about features such
as connectivity, information content, and
              dynamic of these networks.
We plan to apply this framework to test
              existing
algorithms and construct improved new algorithms.

The mail
              benefits of developing the mathematical models of the 
Web structure and
              dynamics will be
the improved theoretical foundation for the design, analysis,
              and
testing of algorithms that operate in the web environment. 
The tangible
              results of this work will therefore be models that can be
subjected to
              experimental verification, analyses of algorithms based
upon these models, new
              algorithms that benefit from these analyses,
and, finally, proof-of-concept
              demonstrations and experimental
evaluations of such algorithms.
