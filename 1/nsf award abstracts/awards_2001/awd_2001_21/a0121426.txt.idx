Abstract    :
              Soon, autonomous mobile robots will be used in settings such as elderly
              communities, schools, and hospitals to carry out intelligent but "unskilled"
              tasks such as delivering food or teaching calisthenics. Humans are integral in
              these systems-as operators, as users, and as people who live and work where
              robots are employed. This proposal targets critical questions of human-robot
              interaction, and of robotic assistants in personal and work settings. The
              research involves experiments on mental models of robots and robotic
              assistants, ethnographic design research, and organizational field research.
              The initial research will aim at design of appropriate roles, tasks, and
              interactions of robotic assistants in elderly environments. Later research will
              address other domains for using assistive robots. This research builds on
              cognitive and social psychology, and design. The research will contribute to
              theory on people's interactions with robots, facilitate useful and graceful
              interactions between people and robotic assistants, and advance robotic
              technology and dialogue on ethical issues surrounding deployment of life-like
              robots. The research team is highly multidisciplinary. This project will
              address major NSF concerns including: bringing technology to bear for special
              populations, extending human capabilities, using technology for collective
              work, and integrating technology into social contexts.
