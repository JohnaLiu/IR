Abstract    :
              This project is seamlessly integrating telescopes equipped with remote access
              and control capabilities into one virtual observatory. Building on the current
              Telescopes in Education (TIE) effort that involves some twenty such telescopes,
              Virtual TIE is providing the services required to operate this facility,
              including a scheduling service, tools for data manipulation, an online proposal
              review environment, an online "Virtual TIE Student Astrophysical Journal" for
              publication of results, and access to related educational materials provided by
              the TIE community. This effort leverages ongoing projects of the collaborators
              to increase access to astronomy education at the K-12 and undergraduate levels,
              especially among traditionally under-served communities. Results of this effort
              are also being used to enhance ongoing educational efforts in astronomy and
              computer science. This project represents a collaborative effort among the
              University of Maryland Baltimore County, Tennessee State University, the
              Telescopes in Education Foundation, Raytheon ITSS, and NASA Goddard Space
              Flight Center. Other partners include the National University of Ireland,
              Maynooth, Rochester Institute of Technology, and TIE project affiliates at
              Little Thompson Observatory and Howard University.
