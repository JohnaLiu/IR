Abstract    :
              EIA-0121568 Kwait, Paul G University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign  ITR/SY:
              Foundations of Solid-State Quantum Information Processing       Quantum
              Information Processing (QIP) lies at the forefront of revolutionary computing
              research, promising radically new powers to computation and communication,
              e.g., unconditionally secure quantum cryptography and quantum logic for greatly
              enhanced speed on certain computational problems. This project addresses the
              critical question of how to achieve a physical system capable of meeting the
              two most challenging requirements for building a quantum computer --
              scalability, the fabrication and coupling of a large number of quantum bits
              ("qubits"), and quantum coherence, the control of noise and external coupling
              effects so that the exquisitely fragile quantum mechanical circuits will not be
              perturbed by unwanted influences.       An interdisciplinary research team at
              the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is exploring a wide range of
              solid state systems based on the manipulation and measurement of magnetic
              moments to perform quantum logic operations. By studying the full range, from
              single spins to small clusters of spins (in quantum dots), to large current
              loops in superconductors, they are attempting to assess the relative merit of
              different techniques, and determine the physical size limits for magnetic
              systems acting as qubits. The ultimate goal is the physical realization of a
              small system for performing quantum logic operations. A key component is the
              integration of research and education via a highly interactive program
              involving undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral investigators. 
              This project is providing a crucial role for an explosive new field such as
              QIP, by providing general awareness of the issues involved and by training a
              pool of experienced researchers.
