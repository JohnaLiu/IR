Abstract    :
              The project will investigate the dynamical mechanisms producing interannual
              changes in stratospheric circulation and ozone, which also influence the
              seasonal climate of the troposphere, notably in winter. Variations in
              stratospheric polar vortex have been shown linked to seasonal anomalies in
              tropospheric zonal-mean zonal winds and circulation patterns (e.g., North
              Atlantic Oscillation/ Arctic Oscillation), which profoundly impact the European
              and North American climate and weather. Ozone variations in the lower
              stratosphere are also strongly linked with dynamics: The ozone distribution in
              the high latitudes is determined by the Brewer-Dobson overturning circulation,
              and radiative heating from ozone absorption in the ultraviolet and thermal
              bands, in turn, influences the temperature and thermal wind distribution. Drs.
              Salby and Callaghan will conduct a dynamically oriented analysis of interannual
              variability to ascertain the sensitivity of the stratosphere circulation to
              tropospheric forcing (upward fluxes of planetary wave activity) and
              stratospheric dynamical structure (Quasi-biennial oscillation phase). The PIs
              will use a 3D primitive equation model in isentropic coordinates for the
              analysis. The project will advance understanding of the forcing of circulation
              and constituent variability in the stratosphere, which will lead to improved
              modeling of troposphere-stratosphere interactions and variability on the
              seasonal-to-interannual time scales. This research should also significantly
              contribute in understanding the causes of observed ozone depletion in the
              northern hemisphere.
