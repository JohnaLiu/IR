Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Perfetti will conduct a one year
              investigation into the possibility that the brain stores information about
              words in ways that depend on their meanings.  For example, concrete words such
              as "dog" and abstract words such as "faith" are quite different in the contexts
              of their use as well as their meaning categories. Thus, people often have
              specific common images associated with concrete words whereas abstract words
              evoke more idiosyncratic images.  Although little is known about how the brain
              represents these and other meaning differences, one very general possibility is
              meanings are represented across an integrated set of brain regions. A concrete
              word such as "dog" may include extensive experience with a particular dog, in
              addition to more general information about visual (what most dogs look like)
              and auditory attributes (sounds made by a dog) associated with dogs. People
              typically have category information as well, inferring that a dog is a mammal
              as well as an animal. By comparison, our knowledge of word meanings that are
              derived more from verbal contexts and less from concrete objects (e.g. "faith")
              could be represented differently. For example, an abstract word such as "faith"
              may have weaker connections to perceptual systems and more reliance on
              connections within the language system. To explore these possibilities, fMRI
              methods will examine blood flow to specific brain regions when adults perform
              simple tasks that involve the meanings of words.   The initial goal of this
              project is to identify the promise of this method for providing information
              about the organization of word meanings. The longer term goal for research of
              this kind is to learn how brain areas work together to support the human
              ability to grasp concepts that are only indirectly connected to everyday
              experience. Increased knowledge of this type is important to a scientific
              understanding of human intellectual abilities and to the loss, recovery, and
              reorganization of these abilities that can follow impairments of various kinds.
