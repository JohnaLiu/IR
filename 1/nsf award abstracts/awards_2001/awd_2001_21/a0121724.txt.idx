Abstract    :
              A collection of digital K-12 materials and resources built around the theme of
              "Water in the Earth System (WES)" is being created to enhance the ability of
              K-12 teachers, students, and parents to easily find, access, and use
              high-quality, standards-based water resources in their classrooms, at home, and
              in informal learning environments. The collection of approximately 500
              exemplary K-12 water resources (scientific, economic, and policy) is being used
              to investigate and learn about important water concepts, processes, and issues.
              The resource materials and associated tools and services are identified,
              reviewed, and cataloged by K - 12 teachers in collaboration with university
              scientists and educators. These individuals are working closely with a number
              of other organizations including: federal and state government
              agencies, professional scientific and education societies, academic
              institutions and centers, and several other National SMETE Digital Library
              projects.  Important co-funding of this project is being provided by the
              Division of Earth Sciences in NSF's Geosciences Directorate.
