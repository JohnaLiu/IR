Collaborative Prosposal-ITR/SY: Molecular Computational
              with Automated Microfluide Sensors\(MCAMS\)


	The main objective of this
              cross-disciplinary project between Princeton University, Stanford University
              and UC Berkeley is to combine microfluidic technology with recently-developed
              algorithms of RNA-based computing to create a compact, automated
              nucelotide-based computational device capable of rapid detection of the
              computational output.  Realization of such a device would greatly impact not
              only the field of molecular computing but also the general field of molecular
              biology, as the proposed platform technologies would provide novel, advanced
              tools for biological research.
The project is addressing three main
              questions:

   - Can a microfluidic device be used to automate RNA-based
              computation?
   - Can alternative detection methods be used to avoid
              labor-intensive readout 
      steps in RNA-based computation?
   -Can these
              detection methods be applied to other problems encountered in general
              biological v          research?

	The success of this project will represent
              a leap forward in the direction of "hands-free" molecular computation.  In
              addition, it will provide the necessary platform technologies to accelerate
              biological research, particularly in the areas of rapid DNA sequencing and
              fingerprinting.
