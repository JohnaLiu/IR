Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will investigate methods for
              evaluating and comparing heuristically derived solutions to multi-objective
              combinatorial optimization problems.  Almost all such problems are NP-Hard, so
              characterizing the Pareto-optimal efficient set is computationally intractable.
               The research will draw on heuristic and approximate solution methods for these
              models, and structure a approach to comparing them based on distance to the
              (possibly) unknown Pareto set.  Drawing on promising preliminary results for
              small models, the research will seek to develop and extend the methods to
              higher dimension.  Multi-objective optimization problems model important
              tradeoffs that decision makers face in many settings. For example, in strategic
              facilities location problems, decision makers must trade off minimizing cost
              and maximizing service.  Most of these problems are also combinatorial, in that
              discrete decisions such as build or don't build require choice of one option or
              another without the opportunity to compromise the difference.  Such models are
              so common in engineering practice that advances in methods for treating them
              have great potential significance to the broad field of operations research.
