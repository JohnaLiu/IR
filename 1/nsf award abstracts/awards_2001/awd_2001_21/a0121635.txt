Abstract    :
              This collaborative project (with personnel at the University of California
              Berkeley) is investigating the creation of a learner-centered metathesaurus
              based on the analysis of transactions between learners and two learning
              resources - the Math Forum and www.smete.org. Three modes of interaction are
              being considered. The first involves data in which many students respond to the
              same problem (the "Problem of the Week" at the Math Forum). The second
              interactional mode involves data from transactions between learners and experts
              (the Math Forum's "Ask Dr. Math" feature). The final interactional mode under
              study uses collections at a third resource, www.smete.org, where learner usage
              is more in the traditional library mode of search-retrieve. Additional feedback
              information in the form of the viewed and selected resources enables the
              construction of a map between the learners' language and resource metadata,
              which has potential to permit the extension of the metathesaurus across domain
              boundaries.
