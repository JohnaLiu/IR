Abstract    :
              Two different physical mechanisms account for the formation of precipitation. 
              In clouds cold enough to contain a mixture of ice crystals and supercooled
              water droplets, the crystals grow by the diffusion of water vapor to sizes
              large enough to coagulate with one another to form snowflakes or to accrete
              cloud droplets and form graupel, snow pellets, or denser forms of ice
              precipitation.  All of these forms of ice-phase precipitation may melt when
              falling through warmer air and reach the ground as rain.  In so-called warm
              clouds, which are not cold enough for ice to form, precipitation can be created
              by an all-water process.  Cloud droplets grow initially by condensation -
              though at a rate slower than ice crystals, because the cloud environment is
              only slightly supersaturated relative to water though it may be strongly
              supersaturated relative to ice.  Once some of the droplets reach a radius of
              about 20 micrometer, they begin to collide with smaller droplets and grow by
              coalescence.  Either the collision-coalescence process or the ice-crystal
              process, depending on cloud temperature, can explain the development of
              precipitation.  However, an uncertain link in the collision-coalescence process
              is the slowness of drop growth by condensation and the consequent long time for
              drops to reach a size where collisions become important.    The goal of this
              continuing research project is to develop a physically consistent understanding
              of the development and evolution of rain in warm clouds.  The approach is based
              on (1) analysis of data from radars, instrumented aircraft, and surface
              observations, and (2) simulations with a detailed cloud microphysical model to
              examine physical processes that cannot be inferred from observations alone. 
              Key unresolved questions are: (1) How do giant nuclei (hygroscopic particles
              larger than 1 micrometer) affect the rate of precipitation onset in different
              kinds of clouds? (2) What are the microphysical mechanisms that account for the
              observed radar characteristics of growing cumulus clouds? (3) How do these
              clouds modify the environment for subsequent cloud development? (4) How do
              environmental parameters such as wind shear influence the rate of precipitation
              production? (5) Do giant nuclei affect the total precipitation falling from
              clouds of different kinds?  Answers to these questions are critical for
              understanding precipitation development and have significance for questions
              related to artificial cloud modification, global precipitation measurements,
              and climate studies.
