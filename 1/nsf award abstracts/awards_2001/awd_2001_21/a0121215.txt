Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Eastern Illinois University will host a
              Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences Regional Conference during the
              week of June 9 through June 15, 2002.

The topic of the conference will be
              the dynamical behavior of the Newtonian N-body problem.  The N-body problem is
              one of the oldest and most challenging problems in the history of mathematics
              requiring knowledge in dynamical systems, geometry,  physics and analysis. 
              Donald Saari, of the University of California-Irvine, will give a series of
              lectures on the history, present state and future outlook of the N-body
              problem. These lectures will be published by the Conference Board of the
              Mathematical Sciences.
