Collaborative
              Proposal-ITR/SY: Molecular Computation with Automated Microfluidic Sensors
              (MCAMS)

	The main objective of this cross-disciplinary project between
              Princeton University, Stanford University and UC Berkeley is to combine
              microfluidic technology with recently-developed algorithms of RNA-based
              computing to create a compact, automated nucelotide-based computational device
              capable of rapid detection of the computational output.  Realization of such a
              device would greatly impact not only the field of molecular computing but also
              the general field of molecular biology, as the proposed platform technologies
              would provide novel, advanced tools for biological research.
The project is
              addressing three main questions:

   - Can a microfluidic device be used to
              automate RNA-based computation?
   - Can alternative detection methods be used
              to avoid labor-intensive readout 
      steps in RNA-based computation?
  
              -Can these detection methods be applied to other problems encountered in
              general biological v          research?

	The success of this project will
              represent a leap forward in the direction of "hands-free" molecular
              computation.  In addition, it will provide the necessary platform technologies
              to accelerate biological research, particularly in the areas of rapid DNA
              sequencing and fingerprinting.
