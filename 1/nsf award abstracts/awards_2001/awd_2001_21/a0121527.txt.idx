Abstract    :
              This targeted research project is investigating and developing tools and social
              protocols to make more feasible the management and maintenance of distributed
              digital library collections in which authors put material into the library and
              librarians (collection managers) organize and annotate it for the library
              patrons. While such "author-based" approaches enable a digital library to grow
              rapidly, they can create confusion as resources are added, deleted, or changed
              without warning. In the case of web sites that are pointed to, noticing when
              those web sites go away, are rehosted, or change their underlying structure is
              very time consuming. Additionally, when changes are made to the content of the
              resources, the collection manager must decide if the new version is still
              suitable for the collection and, if so, whether the document needs to be
              recategorized. Towards the goal of improving the ability of collection managers
              to maintain distributed digital libraries this project is developing: i)
              algorithms and heuristics for identifying resources no longer available; ii)
              methods for identifying the relocation of resources; iii) methods for
              categorizing and evaluating the significance of changes to resources; and iv)
              tools supporting social mechanisms (between resource authors, library managers,
              and library patrons) to contend with document changes. The project plan
              includes the evaluation of identification and categorization algorithms based
              on technical and social metrics. These evaluations answer whether the
              algorithms correctly identify network and server problems, whether resources
              that have been moved are successfully located, and whether ratings of
              significance of change match those of human evaluators.
