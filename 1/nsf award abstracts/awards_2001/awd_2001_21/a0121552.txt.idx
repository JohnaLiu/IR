Abstract    :
              The object of this proposal is to explore the feasibility of controlling various
              modes of a structure under seismic loading through the installation of various
              groups of tuned mass dampers with the frequency range of each group distributed
              around a different modal frequency.  The proposed scheme is called multiple
              distributed tuned mass damper (MDTMD). A MDTMD could combine the robustness and
              efficiency already demonstrated for single mode distributed TMD (in general
              referred to as multiple TMD, or MTMD), with the efficacy of highly damped and
              high mass devices proposed for some single TMD. The exploratory study will
              proceed in stages.  First, some analytical studies reported in the literature
              will be simulated experimentally, on a shake table.  The aim is to better
              understand why different studies yielded inconclusive results.  Second, one
              optimization criteria already developed in the literature for single TMD will
              be extended to the case of a single distributed TMD (controlling one mode), and
              then to the case of a MDTMD controlling several modes. One benchmark case
              study, available to the seismic engineering research community, will be
              retrofitted with the MDTMD.  Simple analytical and laboratory tests will be
              carried out on the reduced scale model to verify the potential effectiveness of
              the dampers.  The aim is to explore the feasibility of the MDTMD for
              controlling multi-modal response for earthquake excitation. Significance and
              impact of the project.  This exploratory work should advance the understanding
              of an important passive control device, and indicate whether or not TMD have
              the potential to be used for multi-modal control.  If the answer in the
              exploratory study is positive, a more in depth research effort will be
              proposed.  The expected outcome of the research will be a versatile, robust,
              and efficient methodology for vibration control of structures. The research
              will also provide much needed experimental data regarding the behavior of TMD
              subjected to ground excitation.
