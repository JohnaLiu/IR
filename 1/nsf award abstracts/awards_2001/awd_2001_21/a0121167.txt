SGER: Digital Government:
              Harvard Forest Carbon Exchange Modeling Work in Connection with Digital Aerial
              Image Analysis by UMass, Amherst.

This grant will support preliminary
              explorations for applying digital video aerial image analysis to long-term
              issues of global warming, in particular carbon cycle modeling, in the
              government arena.  Many government agencies are already using GIS heavily, but
              in a less dynamic way, relying on single images in time, without fine-grain
              time references.  This project will explore government uses of real-time
              imaging, at resolutions beyond what can be achieved with commercial satellite
              images, allowing the digital film to be geo-referenced, integrated with data
              streams from other sensors, and viewed in 3D through polarized glasses.
