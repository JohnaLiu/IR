Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

Rivers are the primary interface between terrestrial and ocean
              environments and play a central and multi-faceted role in linking the
              terrestrial and marine cycles of bioactive elements --- carbon in particular.
              The magnitude of weathering and erosion processes on land, sediment storage
              within the river system, and cycling and burial processes in adjacent ocean
              margins collectively support the premise that rivers and RiOMar environments
              play an important role in global change. 

We seek support for a community
              workshop, to be held on the Tulane University campus (Fall, 2001), in which
              approximately 50 scientists from the earth and ocean science communities will
              participate. Major goals to be addressed at this RiOMar workshop are: (1) To
              assess the current state-of-knowledge regarding the role of rivers and
              associated margins in the global cycles of carbon and other bioactive elements.
              (2) To identify, by community consensus, the major unresolved questions
              regarding RiOMar environments and their role in these global cycles.
              Outstanding iuburning questionslg will be prioritized as a means to focus
              future research efforts. (3) To identify salient areas of research in which
              interdisciplinary and/or cross-cutting research approaches will be needed, and
              to evaluate the manner in which these various research approaches can be
              facilitated.

The central goal of RiOMar is to evaluate the role of rivers
              and associated ocean margins in the global cycles of carbon and other bioactive
              elements, and to better characterize the processes that govern the cycling and
              fate of bioactive elements in these environments.
