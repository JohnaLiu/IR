ITR/SY Reversible
              Computing Using Superconducting Quantum Devices


This project is exploring
              two options of using the unique macroscopic quantum properties of
              superconductor devices for implementation of classical and quantum reversible
              computing.

Under the first objective of classical reversible computing,
              experimental demonstration of reversible processing of digital information in a
              basic integrated circuit using Parametric-Quantuton type devices, with bits
              coded by single quanta of magnetic field are investigated.  The implementation
              of this type of computing device is opening a way to information processing at
              a rate of about 1025 bits per second per Centimeter Square.

Under the second
              objective of quantum reversible computing, the experimental studies of
              decoherence in the charge-based qubit ("single-Cooper-Pair Box"), using the
              radio-frequency single-electron transistor as the readout, is being achieved. 
              Measurement of the decoherence time and investigation of possible ways of
              suppressing the decoherence is facilitating more rapid development of a
              scalable quantum computer.
