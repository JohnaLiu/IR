Abstract    :
              This award is for the partial support of the Southeastern-Atlantic Regional
              Conference on Differential Equations (SEARCDE) that has met annually since
              1981. Conferences traditionally cover broad range of topics in the areas of
              ordinary and partial differential equations, numerical methods, inverse
              problems and provide a necessary forum for communication and collaboration
              between senior and junior investigators.
