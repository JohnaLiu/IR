Abstract    :
              Through this project, the Information Institute of Syracuse is integrating human
              expertise into the evolving digital library being developed through the NSDL
              program and is building a virtual reference desk to support the library. In
              particular, a research study is exploring how the integration of reference and
              collection building may lead to a more effective information service. The
              research questions shall ask when and why users seek help online, and how an
              NSDL virtual reference desk may be evaluated. Multiple qualitative (content
              analysis and "talk aloud protocols") and quantitative (web usage analysis and
              surveys) methods shall be used to ascertain a better understanding of the
              digital reference process. The project's second objective is to build an
              operational virtual reference desk system for the NSDL. This system will build
              on the extensive digital reference expertise the Information Institute of
              Syracuse gained through its AskERIC and Virtual Reference Desk projects. The
              NSDL operational system will use in-place math, science, and technology
              expertise as well as digital reference systems experience to build a
              functioning distributed virtual reference desk.
