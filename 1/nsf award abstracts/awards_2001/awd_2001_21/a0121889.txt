This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI)
              award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will
              take place in Rosario, Argentina, October, 2002, on the topic of ferroelectric
              thin film technology.  Organized by Dr. Orlando Auciello of the Argonne
              National Laboratory, the institute will involve approximately 40 students and
              17 active researchers in the field from the U.S. and Latin America.  The main
              goal is to facilitate extensive scientific discussions and allow students to
              specialize in this interdisciplinary activity, which brings together leaders of
              the ferroelectric materials field.  The design of the program should also help
              to initiate new collaborations between the next generation of scientists and
              engineers from the region.  Lectures and results of the scientific program will
              be disseminated electronically via a web site to be developed for the
              Institute.
