Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Ms. Kessler and her advisor Dr.
              Martohardjono will conduct a year long investigation of the processing of three
              types of errors commonly observed in second language learning.  The specific
              source of grammatical errors produced by second language learners is not well
              understood. Certain persistent types of errors may be linked to grammatical
              operations of the second languages. Kessler and Martohardjono will use timing
              and spatial distribution of electrical potentials from the brain (ERPs) as
              people respond to syntactic, morphosyntactic and morphological errors.  These
              different errors involve different kinds of operations: syntactic errors
              involve word order violations, morphosyntactic errors involve the omission of
              inflection, and morphological errors involve word structure violations.  The
              investigators will compare brain electrical patterns of native speakers with
              those of non-native speakers at various levels of proficiency and test of
              correlations between behavioral data (detection of errors through
              grammaticality judgements) and brain electrical data associated with the
              perception of these errors.    This research will contribute to our
              understanding of the acquisition and processing of structural and inflectional
              information in adult second language learning.  Furthermore, it will serve as a
              baseline for future investigation of both adult and child learners of a second
              language that will enhance our understanding of differences in how child and
              adult L2 learners process different types of linguistic information.
