Abstract    :
              Pacific Resources for Education and Learning (PREL) is the lead agency in a
              network of institutions of higher education working together to establish and
              maintain the Ethnomathematics Digital Library (EDL). Collaborative partners,
              including the Australian Academy of Science, the University of the South
              Pacific, the University of Guam, the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and Ohio
              State University's Eisenhower National Clearinghouse for Mathematics and
              Science Education, comprise the Pacific Ethnomathematics Collections Network
              (PECN).  EDL is an interactive learning environment and resource network for
              ethnomathematics of the Pacific region. The project involves identifying,
              collecting, cataloging, and organizing high quality ethnomathematics curriculum
              and instructional materials, research articles, and other professional
              resources of interest to elementary, secondary and tertiary students and
              teachers, curriculum developers, researchers, and members of institutions of
              higher education. The library provides users with a premier and readily
              accessible source of documents and materials describing the mathematics created
              and used by indigenous cultures around the world. The source for much of this
              material is contained in the PECN libraries and partner organizations, thereby
              providing reliable regional, national, and international accessibility to
              information on the Pacific island communities' particular mathematical ways of
              knowing.  The creation of a central, reliable, and easily accessible
              repository of high quality ethnomathematics information has the potential to
              further the advancement of current understandings of the mathematical
              constructs of indigenous communities. It also has the potential to foster the
              creation and distribution of classroom instructional materials that acknowledge
              and honor these constructs. EDL encourages teachers to search the database for
              relevant ethnomathematics information, create customized classroom materials
              based on this information, and submit these materials for review and possible
              archiving. The digitized ethnomathematics library promotes interactivity
              between resource users and resource providers and the integration of research
              and education.
