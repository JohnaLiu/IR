Abstract    :
              Summary: The objective of this research is to develop an integrated structural
              health monitoring system that utilizes advanced sensing, micro-processing,
              digital signal processing, wireless communication and damage diagnostic
              methods. The current project customizes and implements state-of-the-art
              miniaturized sensor units using MEMS technology and advanced wireless data
              communication methods that employ up-to-date components and architecture. A
              structure with such a distributed "smart" sensor network is thought of as a
              "Wireless IP Cloud of Sensors". New micro-accelerometers of high resolution are
              developed allowing for measurement of high amplitude vibration (i.e.,
              earthquakes) as well as low amplitude vibrations (i.e., ambient vibrations)
              integrated with advanced wireless communication technologies and embedded
              systems for structural health monitoring applications.  The research team is
              collaborating with Sandia National Laboratory in developing MEM-based
              accelerometers manufactured simultaneously along side CMOS circuitry on one die
              coupling the computation and sensor. The goal is to change the practices from
              extensive cabling and high cost labor, equipment and maintenance to the
              instrumentation of inexpensive wireless embedded systems.  The proposed
              damage assessment algorithms are to perform (a) system level screening for
              quick identification of deterioration or damage; and (b) global diagnosis for
              structural performance and damage location identification.  Statistical signal
              processing, energy dissipation and filtering methods are utilized that enable
              the computations to be performed locally at the sensor unit.  A prototype
              system is to be tested both in the laboratory and the field.  Significance
              and Broad Impact: The technology developed under this proposal will enable
              practical, cost-effective, long-term and quick response assessment of civil
              structures that estimates the degree of damage or degradation. The information
              provided by the system is critical following catastrophic events for reducing
              fatalities and for timely closure or continued operation of essential
              facilities (hospitals, fire stations, etc.). The system will also enable
              reliable systematic maintenance to prevent catastrophic failures under
              long-term deterioration.
