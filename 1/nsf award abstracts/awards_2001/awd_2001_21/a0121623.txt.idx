Abstract    :
              The UCAR Unidata program is developing an organizational infrastructure and a
              software infrastructure, Thematic Real-time Environmental Distributed Data
              Services (THREDDS), to enable educators and researchers to locate, analyze,
              visualize, and publish a wide variety of environmental data in both their
              classrooms and laboratories. The framework for this infrastructure is based on
              the concept of publishable (data) inventories and catalogs (PICats) and ties
              together a set of technologies already in use in existing, extensive
              collections of environmental data that reside on remote, distributed servers.
              These include client/server data-access protocols from the University of Rhode
              Island and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the real-time Internet Data
              Distribution system from Unidata, the discovery system at the Digital Library
              for Earth System Education (DLESE), and an extensive set of client
              visualization tools. Based on the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), metadata in
              the form of PICats are created in many different ways. Sites receiving
              real-time environmental data instrument decoders to create PICats describing
              data products as they arrive. Crawlers can also create PICats by traversing
              existing retrospective data collections. Since the PICats do not necessarily
              reside on the server with the data, researchers can create PICats for research
              publications that point to datasets residing on several data servers. Likewise
              educators can incorporate PICats of illustrative datasets into educational
              modules that also include the tools for data analysis and visualization.
              Students may also use PICats to point to datasets related to their research
              projects, just as they now use URLs to point to relevant documents. Finally,
              the text-based nature of PICats allows them to be harvested and indexed in
              digital libraries not only by current document search engines, but also by
              specialized tools that make use of the internal structure and semantic content
              of the PICats. Partial co-funding of this project is being provided by the
              Division of Earth Sciences in NSF's Geosciences Directorate.
