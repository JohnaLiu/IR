              ABSTRACT

Preparing Meteorology Undergraduates for the "Grand Challenge": a
              Prototype Course for Hands-on Observations of Climate Variables

The
              principal investigator is developing an innovative, undergraduate level course
              that focuses on meteorological instrumentation and observations of climate
              variables, along with the analysis and interpretation of climate data, and
              community interactions to develop cause-effect associations.  The course
              involves hands-on training with meteorological instrumentation and analysis of
              climate variables using real-time and archived data, and web-based models.  The
              curriculum introduces undergraduate students to practical applications of field
              instrumentation, measurements and observations while introducing them to the
              synthesis of heterogeneous instrumentation output with human observations.  The
              project promotes and emphasizes student - community interactions for
              understanding the microvariability in climatological observations, and its
              feedback on regional perceptions.  It focuses on educating students on climate
              analysis both as a monitoring and outlook problem, and employs a variety of
              field-tested instrumentation (radiation, micrometeorological and air pollution
              related) and calibration facilities.
