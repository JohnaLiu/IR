Abstract    :
              This is a study of the propagation of ignition and extinction fronts (edge
              flames) on diffusion-flame sheets using a combination of analytical methods and
              numerical simulations.  The scope and utility of the previously articulated
              parabolic flame path assumption (PFPA) and its incorporation into the
              activation-energy asymptotics framework are tested.  Systems examined include
              extinction fronts, colliding triple flames, and circular ignition fronts.  The
              work has implications for describing a member of important practical phenomena
              including lift-off and blow-out of jet flames, autoignition in diesel engines,
              flame spread over fuel beds, and local extinction in turbulent nonpremixed
              combustion.
