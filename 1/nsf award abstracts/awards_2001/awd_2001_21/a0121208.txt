The objective of the proposed research is to examine bacterial
              chemotaxis to organic contaminants.  This research will examine if chemotaxis
              is a significant process with respect to overall biodegradation rates near
              nonaqueous-phase liquid sources.  The importance of chemotaxis in the presence
              of multiple effectors on the biodegradation rate will be examined.  Also, a
              model of chemotaxis flux will be further developed and validated.  The results
              of this research could provide increased understanding of the relevant
              mechanisms that govern in situ biodegradation.  This could help to quantify and
              predict biodegradation rates.
