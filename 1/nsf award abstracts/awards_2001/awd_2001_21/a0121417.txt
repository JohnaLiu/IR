Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT


The maize genome is thought to comprise islands of lightly
              methylated genes in a sea of highly methylated, repetitive DNA.  Complete
              sequencing and assembly of the whole maize genome is currently not feasible
              because of the repetitive DNA.  Methods are beginning to be developed that will
              allow the regions of the maize genome that contain the genes to be filtered out
              for sequencing. It is expected that once validated in maize, such methods could
              be used for similar sequencing projects in other crop species having complex
              genomes.

A novel expression vector system has been developed to rescue
              directly open reading frames (ORFs) from genomic DNA. Preliminary data suggest
              that this "ORF Rescue" vector system is a potentially powerful tool for gene
              discovery in complex crop genomes.  Experiments will be performed to validate
              the utility of this vector system for preparing filtered template DNA for
              genome sequencing. The three specific aims of the project are to:

1]
              	evaluate the ability of the ORF Rescue vector to filter genes from maize
              genomic DNA; 
2] 	evaluate the ability of the ORF Rescue vector to filter
              genes from maize DNA cloned into Bacterial                      Artificial
              Chromosomes (BACs); 
3] 	determine whether novel ORFs define monocot-specific
              genes.
	
This work merits funding as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research
              (SGER) because it represents work on an untested and novel idea that is needed
              urgently.
