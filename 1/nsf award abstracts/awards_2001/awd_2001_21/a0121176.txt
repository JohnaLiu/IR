Abstract    :
              0121176

A modular system for ocean data assimilation has recently been
              developed. It has already been implemented in an unsophisticated way, with a
              variety of models of the ocean and the coupled ocean-atmosphere. This project
              will enhance the system using Information Technology, including modern software
              engineering concepts, new visualization techniques and interactive web-based
              training. Together with effective outreach and advanced optimization
              algorithms, these elements of IT will be linked through the modular system to a
              wide range of coastal, basin-scale and global ocean models. Variational data
              assimilation is also coming into use in operational weather forecasting and
              ocean forecasting, in ocean biogeochemistry, in groundwater hydrology and in
              solid-earth geophysics. The new modular system will thus be of immediate
              benefit throughout the geosciences. The team includes 14 physical
              oceanographers, civil engineers and computer scientists in six universities, a
              national laboratory, and private industry. The project is funded under the
              Information Technology Research Initiative
