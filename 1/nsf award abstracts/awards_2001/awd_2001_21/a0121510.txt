This award supports Professor Patrick S. Mariano,
              Department of Chemistry, University of New Mexico, to conduct collaborative
              research with Professor Ung Chan Yoon, Pusan National University in Korea. The
              joint study will focus on electron transfer photochemistry. Among the various
              types of reactions occurring in electronic excited states of organic substrates
              are those that involve intramolecular transfer of atoms and groups.  These
              reactions proceed by concerted or multi-stepped routes. This collaborative
              research between U.S. and Korean researchers is to develop new and useful
              photochemical reactions.
