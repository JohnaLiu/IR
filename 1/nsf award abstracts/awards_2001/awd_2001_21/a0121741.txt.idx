Abstract    :
              The AI Lab at The University of Arizona is researching, developing, and
              enhancing tools to augment the knowledge, skills and abilities that users bring
              in various degrees to the information search process. Results from three areas
              of research are being used: information analysis and visualization; data
              mining; and search agents. The platform for this research and development is an
              integrated system that allows for the retrieval, analysis, categorization,
              analysis and visualization of information from documents housed in a digital
              library. In addition, through the use of transaction logs from the library, a
              mechanism is provided whereby instructors can gauge the use of resources and
              their students' paths through the learning experience; such transaction logs
              can also prove valuable to students as a record of their learning experience
              within a given course or even throughout their college career. The testbed for
              this work includes two application domains that provide significant differences
              in domain language and subject matter:  computer science and information
              technology, and  the life sciences. Undergraduate students, professors and
              librarians are assisting in the evaluation of the system. The team also expects
              to investigate several issues: (1) whether use of a search agent improves the
              search results of digital library users over those obtained using a
              conventional search engine; (2) whether visualization of search results in the
              browser window reduces user disorientation in the information space; and (3)
              whether synchronous or asynchronous collaboration improves student performance
              over the course of a semester.
