Abstract    :
              The PI will design and build human-computer interfaces that improve human
              memory, which he terms infocockpits.  The basic approach is to take
              well-understood psychology principles and apply them to the design of
              information displays, in particular the fact that human beings are adept at
              remembering information based on its location relative to their body and on the
              place where they were when they learned it. The implementations will use two
              basic strategies:  multiple spatial displays surrounding the user, to engage
              human memory for location;  and ambient context displays (both visual and
              auditory), to engage human memory for place.  This work leverages prior
              collaborative efforts by the PI and Co-PI in virtual reality.  The project
              relates to, and represents a new paradigm for, the retention of information
              instead of its manipulation.  Although the PIs postulate just two fundamental
              design principles, the design space is very large.   The basic research
              apparatus - the infocockpit - will be a computer system with a number of
              traditional display monitors arrayed relative to the user's body.  These
              display screens are then placed in a room where images can be projected onto
              the walls.  This projected imagery, plus ambient 3D surround sound, creates a
              distinctive place in which information is viewed.  The PI will systematically
              vary the configuration, and will run controlled experiments, in which users
              access information and then later are tested for their ability to recall it, to
              examine the benefits of:  multiple monitors arrayed around the user vs. a
              single monitor;  the addition of projected background context;  stationary vs.
              animated background contexts;  having the context semantically related to the
              accessed information;  having ambient and/or localized sound as part of the
              context;  and using hierarchical places to avoid having confusions between many
              different contexts.  The PI will partner with the Virginia Center for Digital
              History which will employ the new design principles to build and provide
              content for infocockpit systems for teaching American history;  this will allow
              the PI to observe how the new techniques work in a real world educational
              application developed by others.   A preliminary study conducted by the PI has
              found a 63% increase in users' memory capabilities;  moreover, functional brain
              imaging assessment of the participants from this study and found that
              experience in the infocockpit resulted in brain activations in areas associated
              with spatial representation, working memory, and visualization.  Thus, the
              question is no longer whether this approach can improve the  user's ability to
              remember information; the question is by how much.
