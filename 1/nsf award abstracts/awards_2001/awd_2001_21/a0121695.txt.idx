Abstract    :
              This grant is the result of a proposal submitted to the Information Technology
              Research (ITR) Initiative.  The award is co-funded equally by the Divisions of
              Materials Research and Advanced Computation Infrastructure and Research.  The
              research is an interdisciplinary effort to simulate the evolution of
              microstructure during materials processing, including the effects of
              microstructure on bulk material properties.  The project advances a set of
              mutually-informative models that, collectively, span atomistic to macroscopic
              length scales and that couple thermal, chemical and mechanical response.  It
              will lead to improved predictive capabilities for optimizing existing materials
              systems, and to the prospect of new engineered materials and processes.  The
              rich physical basis of the models makes them computationally intensive, so a
              closely-coupled program of information technology research is planned to
              support applications research.  The project brings together engineers,
              materials scientists, computer scientists and mathematicians.  It links two
              existing NSF-sponsored research centeres at Illinois: the Center for Process
              Simulation and Design (CPSD), and the Materials Computation Center (MCC).  This
              link is strategic, because it reflects the significant coupling between the
              meso- and macroscopic phenomena that CPSD studies and the largely atomistic
              behavior that MCC investigates.  Three particular applications, listed in order
              of ascending scale, are (i) coupled quantum and continuum models of material
              interfaces; (ii) dendritic solidification with fluid flow in metallic
              microstructures; and (iii) microstructure evolution and process optimization in
              extrusion and quench processes.  The target applications are, in many
              respects, distinct.  Yet, from the perspective of computational science and
              information technology, they pose a number of common challenges.  These include
              problems with moving boundaries and interfaces; coupled and heterogeneous
              physical models at highly disparate length scales; and, computational
              complexity that calls for massively parallel and adaptive analysis techniques,
              as well as improved iterative solution methods.  The group structure of this
              grant allows for sharing solutions across disciplines and the possibility of
              investigating more alternative solutions for each application.  The
              associated information technology includes: domain-specific abstraction
              frameworks that enhance programmer productivity in parallel applications
              development; run-time load-balancing strategies for heterogeneous parallel
              applications exhibiting dynamic behavior; formulation and analysis of
              space-time discontinuous Galerkin methods, space-time mesh generation and 4-D
              visualization; and, new techniques for interface tracking and variable-topology
              shape optimization. %%% This grant is the result of a proposal submitted to
