Abstract    :
              Efficient management of large science facilities requires experience and skills
              not usually found in the repertoire of research scientists.  This proposal
              plans to address this need by establishing a program conducted by a cadre of
              knowledgeable project managers that includes workshops and summer schools to
              which mid-career research scientists, as well as other interested groups, with
              an interest in project management will be invited.  The first steps will
              proceed through "prototype" activities that will identify the detailed needs as
              perceived by institutions and groups involved with major scientific projects. 
              Training workshops and courses will then be developed through a series of such
              prototypes.  The first prototype workshop will target a single emerging project
              and will involve leaders, middle level managers, individual scientists and
              students associated with the selected project.  This workshop will yield a set
              of recommendations for the targeted project,  and will begin the collection of
              tasks and solutions that will form the basis for the remaining work of this
              proposal.  A week-long workshop will be planned using lessons learned from
              earlier prototypes.  Attendance at this workshop is anticipated to be between
              50 and 100 "students" , and would complete the definition of training and
              management materials to be delivered by this proposal.  The proposers will
              author a set of materials and lecture notes for a university course in
              facilities management.
