Abstract    :
              As mobile computing becomes more pervasive, users enjoy increased flexibility in
              terms of where and when they record, retrieve, and transmit information; at the
              same time, the conditions under which these devices are used are becoming more
              variable, less predictable, and in many situations less hospitable.  With
              increasing frequency, computers are being used when lighting is poor, noise is
              unpredictable, or when the user is on the move (e.g., walking, driving a
              vehicle).   In addition, mobile devices often cause users to interrupt an
              ongoing activity in order to perform secondary computer-based tasks: examples
              include individuals replying to e-mails during meetings, doctors reviewing
              operating room schedules while interacting with patients, and individuals
              retrieving directions from their in-vehicle navigation system while driving. 
              The goal of this research is to address the issues involved in developing
              effective computer systems for individuals experiencing such
              situationally-induced impairments (SII).   Like disability-induced impairments
              (DII), SII exist when the physical, cognitive, or perceptual demands placed on
              the user exceed their abilities.   Unlike DII, SII are temporary, resulting
              from the environment in which the work is being performed or the tasks in which
              the user is engaged.  Through this research, the PI and his team will develop
              new techniques for identifying and documenting the factors that contribute to
              SII, will identify methods for developing solutions that address the temporary
              and dynamic nature of SII, and will compare the interaction strategies of
              individuals experiencing SII to those of individuals with comparable DII.
