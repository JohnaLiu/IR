Abstract    :
              0121876 Castillo  This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award,
              jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will
              disseminate current and advanced computational science and engineering
              methodologies through a series of short courses of two weeks duration. 
              Organized by Dr. Jose E. Castillo of San Diego State University, the PASI will
              take place in Cordoba, Argentina, July 2002.  The lectures aim to promote
              in-depth computational science and engineering knowledge, encourage training,
              and foster cooperation among diverse researchers and lecturers of the
              Americas.  Course content will focus on research in areas of computational
              fluid dynamics, numerical optimization, parallel computing, grid generation,
              and geostatistical methods.  Discussion, collaboration and examination of new
              methods will form part of the overall strategy of the lectures. Lectures and
              results of the scientific program will be disseminated electronically via a web
              site to be developed for the Institute.
