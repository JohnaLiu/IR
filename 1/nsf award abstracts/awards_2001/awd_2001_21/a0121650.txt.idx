Abstract    :
              The International Technology Education Association (ITEA) and the Eisenhower
              National Clearinghouse (ENC) are establishing a comprehensive (broad and deep)
              digital collection of resources that supports the teaching and learning of
              technological literacy. K-12 classroom teachers, teaching faculty, museum
              directors, and parents are using the proposed collection to discover
              technological literacy resources; interact with those resources and other
              users; locate relevant research; and link to online professional development.
              ITEA provides content oversight, which includes the development of categories
              for technological literacy and descriptors; identification of digital
              information sources; and evaluation of candidate resources. ENC is building a
              robust electronic infrastructure to support: the development of relevant and
              appropriate metadata (in conjunction with other synergistic NSDL projects); the
              processing of records and abstracts; the development of value-added user
              interfaces; and the maintenance of computer services for optimum and continuous
              digital library operations. An advisory board is providing annual input into
              digital library development and identification of quality digital resources.
              Field testing of the collection and its services is being undertaken with
              diverse groups of users to evaluate ease of navigation and discovery of
              content-rich, pedagogically sound resources. Finally, a variety of methods of
              sustainability for the collection are being explored including public and/or
              private sponsorship and subscriber support.
