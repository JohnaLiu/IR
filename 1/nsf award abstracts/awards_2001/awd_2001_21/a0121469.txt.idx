Abstract    :
              0121469 Ding  The imminent commercial deployment of the 3rd generation 3rd
              wireless communications systems has placed the development of future high rate
              wireless internet and mobile computing at the top of wireless R&D agenda.
              Wireless channels are known to be unreliable and volatile. To develop even
              faster wireless data networks that can serve as the essential last link for
              both nomadic and highly mobile users, wireless system design may require
              fundamental changes in approach. To this end, it has been widely recognized
              that quality-of-serve (QoS) awareness should be introduced to lower network
              layers through a unified design. Even within the physical layer itself,
              separate function blocks such as transmit diversity, equalization, and coding
              must be further integrated to better exploit the available channel bandwidth,
              antenna diversity, and channel coding in order to compensate for unknown and
              time-varying channel distortions as well as co-channel interferences. This
              proposal presents a novel framework for the design integration and VLSI
              implementation of ARQ based wireless data networks and highlights a number of
              critical open research issues for investigation along with many highly
              promising solutions.  The proposed project centers on a unified approach to
              the design integration of ARQ, transmit/receiver diversity, equalization, and
              channel coding in broadband wireless communication systems. It represents a
              clear departure from the current transceiver (physical layer) design approach
              that separately determines and optimizes each individual functionality such as
              channel coding, coded modulation, and channel equalization. Central to the PIs
              proposal is the idea to exploit the use of QoS driven hybrid ARQ at both the
              transmitter and the receiver. This idea represents an important step of design
              integration based on the network use of hybrid ARQ. The PIs proposal focuses on
              a specific mechanism facilitated by an ARQ feedback channel to achieve design
              coordination of physical layer functions of channel
              equalization/pre-compensation, transmit antenna diversity, (turbo) coding, amid
              hybrid ARQ. Their proposed approach is very general and is not limited to a
              specific modulation or network standard. In particular, their research
              objectives amid tasks include  o Joint optimization of turbo coding, turbo
              equalization, amid multiuser detection through code awareness based on temporal
              diversity introduced by hybrid ARQ;  o Turbo equalization amid multiuser
              detection algorithms for transmit diversity with variable rate codes that are
              exploited by the transmitter amid demodulator;  o Broadband spatial turbo
              equalization combined with H-ARQ diversity utilizing codes of different levels
              of error protection as well as iteratively decodable multilevel codes;  o New
              type II hybrid ARQ based on integration of parity retransmission,
              concatenation, Reed-Solomon (RS) outer code, low-density parity check (LDPC)
              inner code, arid turbo coding.  o VLSI design amid implementation of high
              speed decoders for integrated equalization, LDPC, and RS turbo decoding.  o
              Low complexity two-stage turbo decoding of Reed-Solomon codes through their
              binary decomposition into binary component codes with relatively small state
              complexity;  Rather than pursuing incremental advances separately in
              diversity combining, H-ARQ, equalization, and coding, this project presents a
              new and specific network integration approach that will have a strong impact on
              the design of future wireless data networks. The VLSI design amid
              implementation will represent the latest technology for broadband high speed
              communication systems.
