Abstract    :
              Through this Information Technology Research award, electrical engineers,
              computer scientists, and meteorologists at Colorado State University are
              developing a networked radar environment that will link multiple sensors in a
              distributed information environment and provide internet-based access to fused
              multi-dimensional data gathered from different radars and other meteorological
              sensors.  It is an interdisciplinary project involving research in networking,
              radar technology, data fusion, and radar meteorology.  Tasks include research
              on data fusion from multiple sensors with widely differing spatial and temporal
              scales and bandwidths, and novel methods of assuring data quality and data
              dissemination using principles of meta-data.  The project will be centered on
              the CSU-CHILL national radar facility, a polarimetric Doppler radar operated by
              Colorado State University through a cooperative agreement with the National
              Science Foundation.  Other data to be employed in the networking experiments
              are from NEXRAD radars at the National Weather Service offices in Denver and
              Cheyenne, the CSU Pawnee radar, located 48 km north of the CHILL radar, from
              satellite data, and from a surface network of rain gauges and other
              instruments.  Several other universities will participate as remote test sites
              by using the networked environment created by this project.  The experiment
              provides unique educational opportunities in networking research, radar science
              and technology, data fusion, neuro fuzzy systems, cloud and precipitation
              physics, and severe storm research.
