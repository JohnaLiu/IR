Description: This project supports the participation of US
              scientists in an US-Bangladesh Workshop on Composite Materials and Thermal
              Loading to be held in Dhaka, Bangladesh between December 26, 2001 and January
              2, 2002.  The US organizer is Dr. Anwarul Haque, Department of Aerospace
              Engineering and Mechanics, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  The
              co-organizer is Dr. A.K.M. Sadrul Islam, Professor of Mechanical Engineering,
              Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Dhaka, Bangladesh. 
              The workshop will include discussions on response of composite materials to
              various loading conditions including static and cyclic, mechanical and thermal.
               It will include a short course on composite materials with emphasis on polymer
              matrix composites.  The binational workshop is to be in conjunction with a
              meeting organized by the American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) and
              The Bangladesh Society of Mechanical Engineering (BSME) and titled "BSME-ASME
              International Conference on Thermal Engineering".  The organizers plan a
              publication of the proceedings. 

Scope: This project enables four US
              scientists to attend this workshop to exchange information with Bangladesh
              scientists about recent developments in the analytical and experimental
              research on composite materials in the United States and in Bangladesh. 
              Discussions will be held on possible future collaborations among University of
              Alabama and BUET researchers.  The project meets INT objectives in supporting
              workshops where mutual benefit and dissemination of information are likely to
              result.
