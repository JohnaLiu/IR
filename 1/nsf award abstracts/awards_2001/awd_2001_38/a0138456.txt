The wide availability of scanning
              technologies for 
3-d shape acquisition has led to the development of
              
algorithms and software, in both academia and industry, 
for building
              surface meshes from the raw data returned 
by the scanner. For most optical
              and contact sensors
this raw data is in the form of an unorganized point
              
cloud, or PCD set (point cloud data); current scanners 
are able to generate
              object surface samplings at 
submillimeter accuracy. At such high
              resolutions,
these dense PCD sets become adequate representations 
of object
              geometry in themselves, without any need to 
fit a mesh or surface. The work
              undertaken under this 
grant will exploit tools from algebraic topology and
              
computational geometry to perform local and global
analysis directly and
              efficiently on PCD data. Specifically,
algorithms for PCD feature detection,
              segmentation, matching, 
fitting, and compression will be developed and
              analyzed.

It is expected that PCD sets will become a lightweight 
and
              convenient representation of object geometry not 
only in reconstruction or
              visualization applications, 
but even more so in the largely unexplored area
              of directly interrogating object geometry in the PCD format for
applications
              such as robotic exploration or product
customization. Over the next five years
              we can expect 
to see wide commercial deployment of 3-d scanning and 
the
              appearance of compact, portable scanning devices. 
By exploiting the acquired
              PCD data it will become 
possible to customize and tailor manufactured
              products 
to their user to a degree that has been impossible up 
to now.
              Technology developed under this proposal should 
facilitate this transition in
              the apparel, footwear, 
hearing-aid, orthodontic, prosthetics, and automotive
              
industries.
