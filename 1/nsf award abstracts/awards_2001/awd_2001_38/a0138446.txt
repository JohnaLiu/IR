Degeneracies are a major source of robustness
              problems 
in many geometric algorithms.  Many degenerate situations 
can be
              expressed as a root of a multivariate system of 
polynomials.  We propose to
              study the use of toric resultants 
to detect degenerate situations in solid
              modeling applications.  
By taking advantage of the underlying monomial
              structure 
of a system of polynomials, the toric resultant can provide 
a
              method for solving systems of polynomials that is 
dramatically more efficient
              than the classical "dense" 
resultants of Macaulay and Cayley.  We will focus
              on 
application to boundary evaluation for curved solids.
Our work will
              include enumeration of degenerate conditions 
and identifying detection
              algorithms for each category, 
using the toric resultant where appropriate. 
              The work 
is intended to foster future collaborative research 
endeavors on
              topics including resolution of geometric 
degeneracies, general algebraic
              number computation, and
computational Morse theory.

Geometric degeneracies
              occur when a minor perturbation 
of the geometry would cause a qualitatively
              different 
positioning between the objects.  Degeneracies, such as 
two
              overlapping surfaces or a vertex of one object lying 
on the face of another,
              are common occurances in many
real-world solid modeling examples.  The
              problems of 
detecting and dealing with degenerate situations becomes
              
particularly difficult when dealing with curved surfaces.  
Usually,
              detecting such cases involves finding roots of 
polynomials.  Thus, accurate
              and efficient root-finding 
is crucial to an effective approach for
              handling
degeneracies.  The toric resultant is an approach for 
finding
              solutions to systems of polynomial equations.  
Because of its efficiency
              compared to other methods of 
solving such systems, it is a promising
              approach
for detecting and treating degeneracies.  We propose 
to address
              degeneracies in solid modeling applications 
through the use of the toric
              resultant.
