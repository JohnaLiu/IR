Title:	Workshop, December 13-14,
              2001, on New Visions for Software Design and Productivity

The project
              supports costs of travel and local arrangements for a workshop to define a
              future vision for Software Design and Productivity (SDP) research.  The
              workshop is hosted by Vanderbilt University on December 13-14, 2001, bringing
              together 50 to 75 software researchers to discuss the directions for research
              over the next 10 years to improve software development productivity and
              quality.  The participation is determined by a national call for white papers
              on SDP research and a review by a Program Committee established for that
              purpose.  Successful applicants are invited to join Federal agency
              representatives and policy makers to identify research needs, capabilities, and
              shortfalls through open discussions.  The final product of the project is a
              full report on the outcomes of the workshop that will be made available to
              Federal SDP R&D program managers and the community at large.
