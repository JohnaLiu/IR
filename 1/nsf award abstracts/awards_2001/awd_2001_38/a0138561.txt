Abstract    :
              This is a three-year national Teacher Enhancement project that leads to a Master
              of Natural Science degree from Arizona State University.  It can be completed
              within three summers.  The physics and integrated chemistry-physics courses for
              the degree program are tailored to meet the needs of inservice teachers and
              have three main categories of:  1) Research-based physics pedagogy and peer
              community building in accord with the NSES; 2) Interdisciplinary courses to
              promote collaboration among teachers in different sciences; and 3) Major
              advances in 20th century physics taught by research faculty.  The courses are
              complemented by a Leadership Workshop offered one day a week.  All courses will
              be offered in the summer to make the program accessible to teachers nationwide.
               Teaching Associates drawn from the Hestenes' Modeling Physics project will
              share in the course instruction.  During the three years the project will
              enroll 75 residential teachers and 75 local teachers.
