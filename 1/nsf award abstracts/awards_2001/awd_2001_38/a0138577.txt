Abstract    :
              The Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science Collection of Genetic
              Resources is one of the largest and most active collections of wild vertebrate
              frozen tissues in the world.  It contains more than 100,000 samples of frozen
              tissues and tissue extracts (e.g., DNA, proteins, and antisera) from over
              52,000 individual vertebrate specimens. The Collection is housed in 13
              ultracold freezers, but needs for its protection to be moved to liquid nitrogen
              (LN) storage.  Ultracold freezers have a minimum temperature of -80oC, whereas
              liquid nitrogen has a temperature of  -150oC.  The colder temperature would
              preserve the tissues more effectively, and LN storage would protect the
              specimens from damage caused by electric power outages, which are not uncommon
              in Louisiana.  In addition, many  of the herpetological samples in the
              Collection require substantial curatorial attention, including transfer from
              old containers to Nunc tubes, database updating, and cross referencing with
              voucher specimens.   This grant would fund the transfer of herpetological
              specimens from ultracold freezer storage to LN over the next three years.  It
              would also fund the upgrade of the herpetological collection in the process. 
              In the future, the rest of the Collection would be moved to LN storage. 
              Specifically, the project would entail purchasing two LN freezers and
              associated equipment, which would be capable of holding about 60,000 samples,
              and employing a herpetology graduate student as a curatorial assistant to
              oversee the move.  The curatorial assistant would review the packaging and data
              of each of our ca. 15,000 herpetological specimens while moving the samples to
              LN freezers.  

The project would have several benefits for the Collection
              and the research community.  The herpetological specimens would be better
              protected, and their data would be verified, making them more useful as
              specimens.  The graduate curatorial assistant performing the work would gain
              training in the curation of frozen genetic collections, a skill that will
              become increasingly important as the number of these collections grows.  The
              research community will benefit from improved curation and care of the
              Collection in general.  From 1995 through 2000, the Collection accessioned
              15,817 tissue specimens from 22 countries and provided 285 grants consisting of
              3,908 tissues to researchers in 11 countries, plus the USA.  Since 1995, at
              least 240 theses, papers, and books containing results based on comparisons of
              the Collection's tissues and extracts were published.  The contribution of the
              Collection to the productivity of the research community will grow directly as
              a result of the grant.
