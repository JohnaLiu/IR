Abstract    :
              Recognizing the important role the African easterly waves (AEWs) play in
              forecasts ranging from daily to seasonal, this project seeks to understand the
              evolution of AEWs and their interactions with convection. The first part of the
              research is to obtain the statistical relationships in these interactions at
              various phases in the life cycle of AEWs and to investigate the physical
              processes involved in them using the ECMWF analyses, satellite data, radiosonde
              data and raingauge data. The study will then be enhanced through a case-study
              approach following the evolution of individual AEWs and their interactions with
              convection. The third part, albeit at a lower priority, is to investigate the
              intra-seasonal to inter-annual variability of the relationships that exist
              between the AEWs, the African easterly jets, and tropical convection. An
              important goal is to understand and gain knowledge of the precursors of
              Atlantic tropical cyclones through the interactions of the AEWs and tropical
              convection. If a conceptual model can be developed for the preconditioning for
              tropical cyclogenesis, it would be very valuable for the prediction community. 
              

The PI is actively involved in planning the international Western African
              Monsoon (WAM) experiment to be held in 2004/2005. The research from this grant
              will contribute to the planning of the WAM field experiment.
