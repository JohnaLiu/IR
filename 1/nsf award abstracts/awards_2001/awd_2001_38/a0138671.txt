Abstract    :
              This project will create, pilot, field-test and disseminate standards-based
              Professional Development materials that will support in-service needs of
              practicing technology education teachers.  The Standards for Technological
              Literacy have been published, and this project will help teachers to implement
              them in the classroom.  A consortium of institutions will develop the
              materials.  The materials to be produced include two content primers in
              biotechnologies and medical technologies, and a curriculum vision monograph
              that details what technology teachers must know and do to be effective in
              teaching.
