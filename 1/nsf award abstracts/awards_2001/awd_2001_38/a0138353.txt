Funding is provided to continue the now 47-year long series of
              (3000m depth) ocean hydrographic stations near Bermuda, known as Station S or
              the Panulirus Stations. The data have already been used by investigators in
              several disciplines to examine fluctuations at periods from weeks to years in
              the western Atlantic Ocean. Changes over periods of decades are starting to
              appear. The on-going dataset has proven to be an important link in global ocean
              monitoring for both climate research and for evaluating temporal changes of
              many parameters. Ancillary users have, through this program, enhanced the
              measurements at this site to provide a rich array of data available to the
              ocean sciences community. This time series is a contribution to the U.S.
              Climate Variability and Predictability Program (CLIVAR).
