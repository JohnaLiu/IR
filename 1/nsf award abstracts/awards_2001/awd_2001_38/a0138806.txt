Abstract    :
              The "Newark Public Schools Systemic Initiative in Mathematics" is a five-year
              Local Systmeic Change project targeting K-8 mathematics.  In association with
              higher education partners Rutgers University and Montclair State University,
              the project will effect change in three broad areas:  the implementation and
              institutionalization of standards-based curricula, instruction and assessment
              in every K-8 mathematics classroom in Newark; professional development for the
              existing cadre of mathematics resource teachers as well as K-8 teachers and
              administrators; and intensive collaboration with parents, higher education
              partners and community agencies.

The project targets 1040 elementary
              teachers, 260 middle school teachers, 30 mathematics resource teachers, and 60
              school administrators.  Teachers will participate in two-week summer
              institutes, monthly follow-up sessions and mathematics/mathematics education
              courses at the universities.  In addition, teachers will receive ongoing
              classroom-based support for their work.  The mathematics resource teachers will
              receive professional development aimed toward enhancing their ability to
              provide instructional support to the classroom teachers.  School administrators
              will participate in professional development to enhance their understanding of
              current mathematics educational practices, providing a basis for leadership and
              support of standards-based mathematics instruction.  Project partners will also
              develop after-school centers to serve as laboratories for collaboration among
              unversity partners, prospective teachers, undergraduate/graduate students,
              classroom teachers, mathematics resource teachers, administrators and
              parents.
