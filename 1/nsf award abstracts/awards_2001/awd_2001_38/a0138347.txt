An innovative approach to creating a Giant
              Segmented Mirror Telescope (GSMT) that meets the requirements of the decade
              report will be investigated.  The engineering and scientific issues for the
              coherent combination of two telescopes and the technically challenging multiple
              conjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) will be examined in detail.  Replacing a
              single 30-meter telescope by coherently combining light from two 20-meter
              telescopes may be a less expensive, more reliable approach to the realization
              of the GSMT.  Much of the science to be accomplished by the next generation
              ground-based telescopes relies on a working MCAO. MCAO has not yet been
              demonstrated. This effort will advance the state of the art in MCAO
              significantly by providing a critical test of the dynamic refocus at an actual
              astronomical telescope: The MMT near Tucson Arizona.
