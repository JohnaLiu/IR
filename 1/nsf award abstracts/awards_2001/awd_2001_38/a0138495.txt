Abstract    :
              This award supports research by Professor Richard R. Shrock of the Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology concerning the synthetic and mechanistic aspects of
              asymmetric olefin metathesis and the organometallic chemistry of the early
              transition metals involving triamidoamine and diamidoamine ligands.  Olefin
              metathesis involves the 2+2 addition of two olefins to yield two new olefins in
              an economically efficient manner.  The catalysts under study are the only known
              efficient catalysts for asymmetric metathesis reactions and are of interest for
              preparing chiral pharmaceuticals.  Early transition metal complexes with new
              triamidoamine and diamidoamine ligands will be investigated in order to
              delineate how such complexes can facilitate both stoichiometric and catalytic
              reactions.

Organometallic complexes will be investigated in order to improve
              their ability to catalyze organic transformations, particularly those needed
              for the synthesis of chiral drugs.
