Abstract: 
Savin

Gordan Savin is continuing his work on minimal
              representations, with applications to and explicit constructions of some cases
              of Langlands functoriality which can not be obtained by any other method.  The
              subject of automorphic forms is a crossroad of analysis, algebra, and number
              theory. It is a subject with roots in indispensable mathematical theories such
              as Fourier Analysis which impact our everyday lives in many ways.
              Telecommunications, data transmission, and modern instruments of radiology
              would not be possible without Fourier Analysis. 
A purpose of this research is
              to use tools of analysis (calculus) to answer some questions in number theory,
              such as to get a better understanding of zeroes of polynomials. Almost
              everybody knows how to solve a quadratic equation. It is also possible,
              although it is less known, to find zeroes of any polynomial of degree 3 or 4. A
              higher degree polynomial, in general, cannot  be solved, but can be studied
              using some special functions of complex variable (called modular forms).  This
              circle of ideas, which surprisingly relates mathematical theories which at
              first glance do not appear related,  is about 30 years old, and called the
              Langlands Program, after  Robert P. Langlands of the Institute of Advanced
              Sciences in  Princeton.
