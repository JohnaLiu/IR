Abstract    :
              This research creates and compiles data to reinterpret the history of human
              health in Europe from the late Paleolithic era to the early twentieth century. 
              During this period, human health was transformed enormously by the transition
              from foraging to farming; the rise of cities and complex forms of social and
              political organization; European colonization; and
              industrialization.
Skeletons are the best single source available to scholars
              for measuring and analyzing very long-term trends in health.  With a
              trans-Atlantic network of collaborators, the project will gather and analyze
              skeletal measures of health from 40,000 individuals who lived in Europe over
              the past 10,000 years.  Specific information collected from skeletons housed in
              numerous European museums includes:  age at death; sex; stature inferred from
              long-bone lengths; dental decay; degenerative joint disease; trauma; skeletal
              infections; and the occurrence of specific diseases such as tuberculosis,
              rickets, and leprosy.  Project researchers will also scour the published and
              the gray literature of site reports that contain information on the heights of
              100,000 men and women.
When combined with ecological information to be
              collected, the data will have numerous uses, including studies of:  (1) health,
              climate and habitat; (2) health and the transition to farming; (3) the social
              and economic causes and consequences of long-term changes in health; (4) the
              health of women and children; (5) patterns of trauma and violence; (6)
              biological inequality; (7) aging and health; (8) health during the rise and
              fall of civilizations; a
