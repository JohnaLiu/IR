Abstract    :
              A comprehensive analysis of sub-synoptic-scale variability of aerosol properties
              will be carried out. For this purpose, the PIs will assemble and merge data
              from a large number of field campaigns, including ground-based and airborne
              measurements of aerosol physical, chemical and optical properties relevant to
              direct climate forcing. Instrumental noise and uncertainty will be quantified.
              Then the merged data set will be statistically characterized to determine
              patterns of variation and covariation that apply across multiple regions and
              aerosol types. A general statistical model of aerosol variability will be built
              and used to interpret and design future field experiments.

This project, if
              successful, will provide new information about patterns of aerosol variability
              and covariances of aerosol parameters. This information in turn will be useful
              for designing future field experiments as well as satellite instruments.
