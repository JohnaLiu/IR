Abstract    :
              This project will develop six mathematics and six science graduate level
              courses.  The goal is to provide science and mathematics content for teachers
              with elementary certifications who now teach at the middle school level.  Each
              summer participants will take either two math or two science courses during an
              intensive four-week program.  It is expected the same participants will return
              for three years, eventually taking all six courses.  150 teachers will be
              served over a three-year period.  Teachers will receive follow-up support
              through the internet and/or on-site support.  Competitive $500 grants will be
              available for supplies and travel.  In addition, the PI will establish a
              professional development support group, the Northeastern Oklahoma Math and
              Science Teacher Association (NOMSTA).
