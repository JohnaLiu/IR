Abstract    :
              This program aims to energize 6th-8th grade students in two middle schools
              within two St. Louis school districts, about math, science, and engineering
              through experimentation and computer visualization.  Ten teaching teams with
              specific areas of expertise will be formed, consisting of a GK-12 Fellow, a
              UGTA, a K-12 teacher and a Washington University faculty member.  Each team
              will develop a teaching module in conjunction with K-12 teachers in a K-12
              subject area related to the research interests of the students. A team will
              rotate through four classrooms during each year and since each project is
              multidisciplinary, teaching teams will be expected to draw on the expertise of
              other teams as necessary.  This program will achieve the maximum leverage
              possible by ensuring that each student has an opportunity to develop a depth of
              knowledge in at least four areas and learn how each is strongly tied to the
              other disciplines. Faculty from the Washington University Department of
              Education will develop and implement a GK-12 Teaching Workshop to instruct the
              teaching teams so that they will have a more effective interaction with the
              students.  The GK-12 Fellows will be selected from diverse backgrounds and in
              addition to classroom activities will act as role models to the students,
              potentially influencing them to consider math, science, or engineering as
              career options. This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate
              for Engineering.
