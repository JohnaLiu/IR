Abstract    :
              This award supports the improvement of instrumentation and techniques that can
              be used for measurement of movement of cell membrane proteins based on
              time-resolved phosphorescence anisotropy and fluorescence depletion anisotropy.
               Improved instrumentation will result from introduction of a high pulse rate
              diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser, low rearm-time digitizers, two-channel data
              acquisition and improved electronics.  Improvements in detector gating for
              time-domain measurements will be explored by a combination of direct optical
              gating and low after-pulsing strategies for photomultiplier gating. This is
              expected to permit examination of rotational relaxations occurring within a few
              microseconds. The implementation of frequency-domain and "continuous" versions
              of fluorescence depletion anisotropy will be explored for examination of
              weakly- expressed cell surface proteins.  Improvements will be evaluated by
              measuring protein rotation on a consistent test system, namely the Type I Fc
              receptor on 2H3 mast cells.  Improvements in the ability to measure the
              dynamics of membrane proteins should provide greater understanding of the
              function of membrane-bound receptors and other proteins whose ability to move
              within the membrane is key to their role in intracellular signaling and other
              important biological processes.
