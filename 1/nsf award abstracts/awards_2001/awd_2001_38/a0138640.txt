Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              (REU) "site" at six primarily undergraduate institutions. This dispersed site
              is coordinated by David Rheingold at Juniata College and involves 12
              undergraduates each summer for 2002, 2003 and 2004. While this REU site is
              geographically dispersed, it is linked by the common theme of physical organic
              chemistry. The research projects include the synthesis and material science
              applications of hexaazaanthracenes (Brisbois, Macalester); antiaromatic
              fluorenyl and indenyl dications (Mills, Trinity University);  rational
              syntheses of buckminsterfullerene (Mitzel, Trinity College); ordered arrays of
              polyphenols by tandem reactions (Rheingold, Juniata); synthesis and electronic
              structure of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl-phenylacetylenes (Mondanaro, St. Michael's
              College); and electronic effects in the cycloaromatization of arenediynes
              (Russell, Northern Kentucky University). Students will be recruited by each
              research mentor, with special efforts to recruit members of underrepresented
              groups. The mentors and undergraduate researchers will meet as a group at least
              twice each summer (once at a national meeting) and use electronic bulletin
              boards or tele/video conferences to discuss their research informally. The REU
              program will be assessessed by participant surveys and faculty evaluations of
              student progress.
