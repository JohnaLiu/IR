This interdisciplinary study combines scientific ecological
              knowledge (SEK) and the  traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of the Inupiat
              people regarding Kotzebue Sound, Alaska.  The research will focus on developing
              an ecological profile of the nearshore Kotzebue Sound and testing three
              hypotheses regarding food webs, sewage impacts, and ecosystem change.  Common
              methods of ethnography will be used to elicit TEK, and standard oceanographic
              techniques will be used for the SEK portion of the study.  The project includes
              outreach to local schools and will bring local students of all ages into the
              data collection process.
