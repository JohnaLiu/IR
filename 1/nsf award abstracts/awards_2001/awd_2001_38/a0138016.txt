Abstract    :
              	This research will  investigate recent, often clandestine, Chinese immigration
              into the United States.  It combines interviews with recent immigrants in New
              York with a systematic sample of Chinese households from six community sending
              areas in Fujian province.  Besides basic data on socioeconomic status of the
              households, the interviews will collect information on exposure to networks of
              migration agents.  For long distance immigration such as from Fujian, these
              networks should be crucial, especially as the migration flows increase. 
              Household data on remittances and community inventories will be used to
              evaluate the impact of the migration on business development in the sending
              communities in Fujian.
