Title: REU
              DIMACS-DIMATIA International REU Program

DIMACS, the Center for Discrete
              Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science, headquartered at Rutgers
              University, proposes a three-part domestic and international REU program. The
              program will be co-sponsored by DIMATIA, the Center for Discrete Mathematics,
              Theoretical Informatics, and Applications, at Charles University in Prague,
              Czech Republic. The REU program we are proposing will be modeled after the
              highly successful programs we have already run and will have the following
              three parts: (i) A group of five students from all across the U.S. will
              participate in an 8-week REU program headquartered at DIMACS; (ii) A second
              group of five students from all across the U.S. will participate in the 8-week
              domestic REU program and then spend 3 additional weeks at DIMATIA; (iii) a
              group of five students from the Czech Republic will participate in the 8-week
              domestic REU program and then act as hosts at DIMATIA when the U.S. students go
              to Prague. The REU program will focus on the strengths that are joint between
              DIMACS and DIMATIA, and in particular on the fields of extremal and algebraic
              combinatorics, graph theory, computational geometry, logic and complexity
              theory, and combinatorial optimization.
