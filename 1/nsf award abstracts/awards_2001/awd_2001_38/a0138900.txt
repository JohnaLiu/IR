Abstract    :
              The intended three-year project will produce a robust Professional Development
              package for school districts to support the implementation of the middle school
              curriculum, "Constructing Ideas in Physical Science (CIPS)."  The package will
              include a program to engage teachers in 120 hours of substantive professional
              development over a period of two years.  The materials will consist of a
              weeklong "getting started" workshop to introduce teachers to CIPS, materials
              for seven follow-up workshops, a CIPS user's site and two CIPS discussion
              forums.  The follow-up workshops address teachers' emergent needs during the
              first two years of teaching CIPS and introduce and support the use of the users
              site and forums.  The latter will support web-based discussions about science
              teaching, student learning and physical science.  The package will be developed
              by an experienced team of university physical science education researchers,
              middle school science teachers and other experts, and will be piloted and field
              tested at three large school systems throughout the United States. Project
              evaluation will include classroom observations for the purpose of monitoring
              teacher practice and student learning.
