This grant supports the research of the principal
              investigator and
his colleagues on the arithmetic theory of integral
              quadratic
forms and related topics.  They will work on the
              representation
theory of positive definite quadratic forms, the almost
              strong
approximation properties of simply connected algebraic groups
              of
compact types, and the classification of quaternary quadratic
forms with
              improper automorphism groups by their degree two theta
series.

Quadratic
              forms are homogenous polynomials of degree two in many
variables.  This
              research concerns the number theoretic problems
which arises from deciding
              which integers can be values of the
quadratic forms when the variables are
              replaced by integers.  It
falls into the area of number theory which is among
              the oldest
branches of mathematics.  Nowadays, quadratic forms and
              other
kinds of number theory become indispensable tools in
              communication
sciences, data transmission and processing, construction of
              error
correcting codes, and cryptography in information technology.
