Support vector
              machines (SVMs) have played a key role in broad classes of problems arising in
              various fields. Much more recently, SVMs have become the tool of choice for
              problems arising in data mining. This proposal de-scribes some aspects of
              support vector machines that the proposer would like to study and contribute
              further to. These include: generalized SVMs (a gen-eral mathematical
              programming framework for SVMs), unconstrained SVMs (a strongly convex
              minimization reformulation of SVMs solvable by a fast
finite method),
              Lagrangian classification (an unconstrained Lagrangian rep-resentation of SVMs
              leading to an extremely simple iterative scheme capable of solving
              classification problems with millions of data points) and reduced data
              classification (a rectangular kernel classifier that is characterized by as
              little as 1% of the data).
