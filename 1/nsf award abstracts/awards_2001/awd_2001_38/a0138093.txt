Abstract    :
              Professor Andres Campiglia of North Dakota State University is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program for fundamental studies exploring the
              use of low temperature matrices for the spectroanalysis of polyaromatic
              hydrocarbons, which are toxic compounds found in the environment.  The use of
              multiple parameters (e.g. excitation wavelength, emission wavelength,
              fluorescence and phosphorescence lifetime) will allow the analysis of complex
              mixtures of PAH's at very low concentrations.  A fiberoptic is implanted in the
              matrix itself for sensitive detection.

Polyaromatic hydrocarbons are
              extremely toxic compounds found in the environment, near oil refineries, for
              example.  The spectroscopic detection and identification of complex mixtures of
              closely resembling compounds is an analytical challenge.  Students will be
              trained in methods of low temperature emission methods that have the potential
              for significant impact in the rapid, cost-effective sampling of soils and water
              in polluted areas.
