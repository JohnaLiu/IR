Abstract    :
              Aaron Kuppermann of the California Institute of Technology is supported by the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to use theoretical quantum
              reaction dynamics and associated ab initio reactive scattering calculations to
              understand bimolecular reactions in triatomic, tetraatomic, and larger
              polyatomic systems, including electronically nonadiabatic effects.  Dynamic
              resonances will be located and explored, along with other significant
              properties of this benchmark reactive system.  Also, a new hybrid
              quantum-classical approach will be combined with a Bohmian quantum-corrected
              force field to create a hybrid methodology with potential capabilities for
              describing complex three- or four-center chemical reactions. 

Elementary
              chemical reactions are the basic building blocks for designing and
              understanding complex technologically important systems, such as combustion
              processes, atmospheric chemistry, chemical lasers, and behavior in plasma
              reactors.  Continuing improvements in high performance computing resources will
              enable new molecular level understanding of important gas phase chemical
              reactions.
