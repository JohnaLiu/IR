This
              award supports U.S. participants in the conference on Nonlinear Differential
              Equations, Mechanics, and Bifurcation held at Duke University on May 20-22,
              2002.  The purpose of the conference is to explore connections between the
              fields of ordinary and partial differential equations, mechanics and
              bifurcation, and industrial mathematics, and to encourage the involvement of
              young mathematical scientists in these areas.
The speakers include established
              leaders in these fields, as well as promising young mathematicians and
              scientists.  The meeting is a collaboration between the Research Triangle
              universities of Duke University, North Carolina State University, and the
              University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The central theme of the
              conference is the role of nonlinearity in physical systems, especially
              elasticity, granular materials, and fluid flow.  The interplay between
              experiments, modeling, theoretical mechanics, mathematical analysis, numerical
              simulation, and industrial design has proved particularly fruitful in recent
              years. This conference brings together scientists and mathematicians from all
              of these areas. The conference is designed to include lively discussion of the
              interplay between discoveries of new experimental phenomena, proposed
              mathematical models, theoretical developments and challenges, and corresponding
              innovations in numerical methods.  Bifurcation and pattern formation are
              observed in experiments with solids, fluids and granular materials, and the
              mathematical techniques to analyze phenomena have grown quite sophisticated. 
              This connection between experiment and theory, coupled to numerical simulation,
              occurs throughout the conference.
