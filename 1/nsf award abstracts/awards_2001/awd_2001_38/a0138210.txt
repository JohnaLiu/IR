Abstract    :
              The main thrust of the research is the further development of methods to
              calculate QED corrections to energy levels and g-factors of loosely bound
              systems.  Nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics is applied to the Lamb shift
              in H, hyperfine splitting of muonium, Lamb shift in muonic H and the bound
              electrong g-factor
