This grant
              will support preliminary explorations in integrating 10 datasets, some digital
              and some paper, related to the modeling of the flow of freight carried by
              trucks, rail, and ship in the greater Los Angeles area.  The collaboration will
              be between information scientists and experts in transportation planning and
              policy and will involve the collaboration of several government agencies.
