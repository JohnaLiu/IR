Description:  This award is for US-India collaborative
              research in biochemistry entitled Enzyme-Inorganic Materials: Peroxidase
              Behavior at Selected Interfaces.  The investigators will test the hypothesis
              that solid surfaces perturb enzyme structure, and that the extent of
              perturbation depends on the strength of interaction between the solid and the
              enzyme.  The key issues addressed in this research are important for the
              rational design of materials for enzyme binding.  Advanced materials of this
              type have applications in biocatalysis, biosensors, implants, and artificial
              organs. 
  
Scope:  This initiates a three-way collaboration between US PI
              Challa V. Kumar of the University of Connecticut and C.P. Rao, Indian Institute
              of Technology (IIT) Mumbai and V. Jagannadham, Osamania University (OU).  The
              proposed studies are logical extensions of the research interests of the US PI
              and overlap with the collaborators interests.  The IIT group brings to the
              collaboration their expertise in design, synthesis, and chacterization of
              ligands/metal complexes, while the OU group brings its  high level expertise in
              reaction kinetics and mechanistic studies.  It  will enhance research and
              teaching activities at all three institutions.  The project is supported by the
              Indian Department of Science and Technology(DST) under the NSF/DST joint
              program.
