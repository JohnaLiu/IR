Roesler, Fred

A unique, innovative Fourier Transform
              Spectrometer (FTS) will be designed and built to map the [O II] 3727 forbidden
              emission in the Galaxy. These data will be combined with similar data recorded
              of longer wavelength emission lines to determine the physical parameters of the
              hot interstellar medium. The results will influence work in star formation, and
              galactic dynamics as well as work in the hot interstellar medium.  This
              innovative approach to instrumentation will also have application to other
              areas of astronomy. This work will support one graduate student and one
              undergraduate.
