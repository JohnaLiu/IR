Abstract    :
              The University of North Texas (UNT) supports a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site with the theme of characterization of electronic
              materials and devices. Twelve students are recruited nationwide every year for
              a nine-week summer research experience. The REU Site includes faculty from the
              Physics, Materials Science and Chemistry Departments at UNT; it includes the
              facilities at the University's Ion Beam Modification Laboratory and the
              Laboratory for Electronic Materials and Devices. Students participate in a
              variety of research projects within the areas of surface studies of
              semiconductors, metals and insulators, electroluminescent polymer composites,
              and high-electric field gas phase and surface chemistries.  Undergraduates also
              attend scientific seminars and tutorial sessions on research ethics and
              graduate studies, and participate in visits to semiconductor and high tech
              industries in the area.
