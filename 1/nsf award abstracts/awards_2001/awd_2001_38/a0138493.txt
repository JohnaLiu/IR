Description:  This award supports US-India cooperative
              research entitled Development of a Digital Artifact Archive: An American and
              Indian Collaboration for Pottery Visualization and Analysis.  Jeffrey Clark of
              Archaeology Technologies Laboratory (ATL) at North Dakota State University
              (NDSU) in Fargo, North Dakota and Vinod Nautiyal of the Department of History
              and Archaeology at HNB Garhwal University in Srinagar will link their databases
              to create a digital archive of historic and prehistoric artifacts, with special
              emphasis on archaeological collections of Indian pottery.  These databases will
              become part of an NDSU project, the Digital Archive Network for Anthropology
              (DANA), which is a federation of distributed, interoperable databases, each
              with specific content that is of value to archaeology, anthropology, and
              related fields.  DANA will contain three-dimensional (3D) models of artifacts
              that are sufficiently precise to allow for detailed measurements and analyses. 
              

Scope:  This research will make archival data and 3D renderings of physical
              objects through DANA available to researchers and eventually to other users via
              the internet using state-of-the-art technology for digital archiving and
              distributed networking.  While the intention is to provide a unique and
              innovative set of products and services, the underlying technologies are
              understood on both sides and the collaboration will draw upon the strengths and
              experience of both partners.  The immediate goal of the India collaboration is
              to demonstrate the viability of the DANA project internationally.  In the long
              term, this effort is an important step toward enabling the conduct of research
              in a virtual environment.  The Indian Department of Science and Technology(DST)
              is funding this research under the NSF/DST joint program.
