A millimeter wave bolometric receiver will be built
              for the 12-meter diameter Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) telescope in
              transition with Max Planck Institute for Radioastronomy (MPIfR) in Bonn,
              Germany.  This receiver is a 300-element bolometric receiver for observations
              at 150 and 217 GHz. The bolometers will be horn-coupled, spider-web devices
              with superconducting transistor-edge sensors (TES) each using SQUID ammeter
              readout configured for 1024 elements. This receiver will be used to discover
              and study galaxy clusters via the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at
              millimeter wavelengths.  Data recorded with optical and x-ray measurements,
              when correlated with data recorded by this receiver promise to 1.  reveal the
              formation history of galaxies, 2. Probe the nature of dark energy by measuring
              its equation of state, and 3. measure cosmological parameters including the
              mass energy density and the Hubble constant.
