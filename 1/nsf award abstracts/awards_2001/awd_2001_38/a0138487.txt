Abstract    :
              This is a U.S.-East European workshop on algebraic geometry and geometric
              modeling that will be held in Lithuania.  The principal investigators are Dr.
              Ronald Goldman from William March Rice University and Professor Rimvydas
              Krasauskas from Vilnius University.

Algebraic geometry has in the past
              affected and in the present continues to affect the progress of geometric
              modeling and computer aided design.  The purpose of this workshop is to provide
              an opportunity to disseminate new trends and techniques in algebraic geometry
              to the geometric modeling community.  The Lithuanian mathematicians and
              computer scientists have taken the lead in investigating applications of toric
              varieties to geometric modeling.  These applications are largely unknown in the
              U.S. and Western Europe and this workshop will serve as an effective mechanism
              for promoting and disseminating this work.

This workshop in mathematics and
              computer sciences fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading
              experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts
              and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis
              of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
