Abstract    :
              In the Pacific region served by Pacific Resources for Education and Learning
              (PREL), lack of access to four-year degree granting programs, coupled with a
              rapidly growing student population, resulted in the increased hiring of
              inexperienced and under-qualified teachers.  The MENTOR Project addressed this
              problem by establishing a mentoring program for novice teachers aimed at
              developing in them the knowledge, skills and dispositions necessary to be
              effective teachers of mathematics, thereby decreasing the length and trauma of
              their induction into teaching and increasing their commitment to the
              profession.

Based on training led by PREL personnel, Project mentors provide
              summer institutes as well as in-class nentoring, inquiry group sessions, and
              lesson study for novice teachers.  The Project includes two cadres, one a group
              of well-trained and effective mentors of novice teachers, and the other a group
              effective novice teachers who have an understanding of how to implement
              standards-based mathematics instruction and who exhibit a strong commitment to
              the profession.  Working together these two groups will generate a collection
              of exemplary standards-based lesson plans, make presentations at three Pacific
              Education Conferences (in 2003, 2004 and 2005), and prepare for publication a
              set of narratives describing novice teachers' and mentors' professional growth
              in the MENTOR Project.

The MENTOR Project contributes significantly to the
              development of culturally responsive and appropraite mentoring models for
              neo-indigenous cultures characterized by linguistic diversity and geographic
              isolation. The insights gained inform attempts to establish mentoring and other
              professional development programs in cross-cultural settings in the Pacific and
              beyond.
