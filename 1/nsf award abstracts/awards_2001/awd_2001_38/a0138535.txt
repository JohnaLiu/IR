Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Furman University.  Timothy Hanks
              is the site's Program Director and Moses Lee is the Co-Program Director. Twelve
              faculty will serve as REU student mentors.  Over the award period (2002-2004),
              ten students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program.  Of these
              students, 4-6 will be from regional institutions with limited research
              opportunities and at least 50% will be from NSF-targeted demographic groups. 
              Another feature of the program is that a faculty member will accompany up to
              three of the visiting students and will serve as research mentors.  The
              research focus of the program will be on nanoscience projects in one of three
              special interest groups: Monolayers and Surfaces, Supramolecuar Structures and
              DNA Complexes.  All participants (students and research mentors) will provide a
              written evaluation of the program at its conclusion.  In addition, the program
              will monitor the number of their REU students that pursue graduate degrees and
              the number of student co-authored publications in professional and peer
              reviewed journals.
