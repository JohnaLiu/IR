Abstract    :
              This Pilot Local Systemic change project is a partnership between the University
              of Missouri-Columbia and the Columbia Public Schools.  It supports forty
              mathematics teachers (grades 8-12) as they implement Contemporary Mathematics
              in Context (Core Plus).  Using a model of professional development designed
              around four important issues (building teachers' knowledge base about content
              and pedagogy, supporting teachers in both the planning and implementation
              phases of instruction, and helping teachers reflect on the entire process),
              project staff and a Core Plus author design and implement over 200 hours of
              professional development over a two-year period.  The project seeks to
              understand the professional development support and its influences on teacher
              knowledge and practices.  The project supports building a continuing
              educational infrastructure in which preservice mathematics teachers can
              actively participate and learn about teaching mathematics in classrooms where
              reform curricula are being faithfully implemented.
