This is a collaborative project funded by the CARGO program
              under
DMS-0138458, DMS-0221642, and DMS-0221669.  This is the Age of
              Information.  Whether it be in scientific computation or reverse engineering,
              in remote sensing or medicine, data sets of 
incredible resolution and
              exquisite detail are created
daily.  These data sets often have geometric
              structure which 
contains important information about the data and its
              
application.  The usefulness of such geometric datasets 
rests on our
              ability to process them efficiently, whether 
it be for storage, transmission,
              visual display, correlation, 
or registration against data from other
              modalities.  
Compression is the common critical issue in all
these
              applications.

Current data processing technology does not provide the
              
efficient and geometrically faithful representations demanded 
by
              applications. In fact, a satisfactory data processing 
platform will not be
              created by incremental advances of current technology but rather through a
              fundamental investigation of 
how to represent large data sets with inherent
              geometry. To 
pursue the necessary advances a team of researchers and
              
application developers representing expertise from
several disciplines
              including mathematics, computer science, 
and engineering has been assembled.
              As drivers of the research, specially targeted applications (DTED, reverse
              engineering, 
physical simulation) have been selected to guide the formulation
              
of the most critical and meaningful problems, as well as testing approaches
              to solving them.  The team is carrying out 
fundamental investigations on the
              representation and compression 
of data sets with geometry by building new
              mathematical theory
including deterministic models, appropriate application
              
specific error metrics (e.g., Haussdorf distance rather
than Lp norms), an
              information theory based on Kolmogorov 
entropy to determine the optimal
              compression, and the 
development of nonlinear methods for representing the
              data 
sets which are near optimal in the entropy sense.
