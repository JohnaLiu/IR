Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the processes of formation and evolution of polar
              mesospheric summer echoes (PMSE) and mesospheric summer echoes (MSE). 
              Non-turbulent and weakly turbulent PMSE and MSE events will be investigated
              through a combination of modeling studies and observational data from radar and
              rocket-based instrumentation.  Rocket data will provide ion, electron, and
              temperature profiles at very high vertical resolution which can be used to
              constrain the modeling problems.  The anticipated outcomes of this project are
              a comprehensive understanding of PMSE and MSE formation and structure and
              interpretation of rocket and radar data, which will lead to enhanced design of
              experiments and instruments.
