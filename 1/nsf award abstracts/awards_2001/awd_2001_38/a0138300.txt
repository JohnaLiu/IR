This award supports the participation of ten US scientists in
              a US-South Africa Workshop on Bacterial Wilt Disease, to be held in White
              River, South Africa, in February 2002.  The co-organizers are Caitilyn Allen,
              University of Wisconsin, and Jody Terblance and Gerrit Prinsloo, Institute for
              Industrial Corps, South African Agricultural Research Council.  The workshop is
              being held in conjunction with the Third International Symposium on Bacterial
              Wilt Disease, which is scheduled for February 4-8, 2002.   Three graduate
              students and one postdoctoral fellow are among the US
              participants.

Bacterial wilt disease attacks many cash and subsistence crops
              in the tropics and subtropics, including tomatoes, potatoes, bananas,
              plantains, peanuts, and tobacco.  The pathogen responsible for bacterial wilt
              is a soilborne bacterium, Ralstonia solanacearum.  Because of its geographic
              distribution, the disease has received relatively little attention from
              researchers in Europe and North America, even as it causes devastating crop
              losses each year in the developing world.  The goals of the workshop are to
              establish common areas of interest among US and South African researchers,
              design collaborative projects, identify and prioritize the most pressing issues
              currently confronting bacterial wilt researchers in these regions, and develop
              procedures for exchanging scientific materials necessary for effective
              bacterial wilt research.
