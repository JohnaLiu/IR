Abstract    :
              The purpose of this satellite meeting of the Society for Neuroscience is to
              bring together an international group of students and researchers representing
              diverse fields related to the ontogeny of motor behavior in vertebrates to
              assess the current status of the field, to discuss strategies for future
              research, and to establish a foundation for interdisciplinary collaboration. 
              In order to accomplish these objectives, researchers using diverse animal
              species as well as diverse methodologies ranging from the molecular to
              behavioral will be invited.  This symposium will provide a rare opportunity for
              scientists from different disciplines and perspectives to develop new
              collaborations and new approaches to understanding the ontogeny of motor
              behavior.  Announcements and other publicity for the symposium will encourage
              attendance by women and underrepresented minorities.  The summary of the
              meeting will be published in Neuron as a Meeting Review.
