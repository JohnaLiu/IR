This six-month award will support a dissertation
              enhancement project of Sean Bailey, a student in the Department of Mechanical
              Engineering at Stanford University. He will work with Prof. Paolo Dario at the
              ARTS Laboratory at the Scuola Superiore Santa Anna (SSSA), in Pisa, Italy. The
              objective of Mr. Bailey's research is to extend the layered manufacturing
              approach of Shape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM) to mesoscale robotic devices. 
              The researchers at SSSA are experts in the design of small medical devices. 
              While at SSSA, Mr. Bailey will become familiar with state-of-the-art
              small-scale processing machines.  He will then develop SDM techniques using
              these machines for mesoscale robots and demonstrate these new techniques by
              producing a highly sensorized mesoscale probe.  A particular goal is to
              formalize the process planning constraints that apply in this specialized
              variation on SDM.
