Abstract    :
              Professor Qin will work in the general area of algebraic 
geometry and its
              interplay with representation theory and 
string theory.  The main tools are
              the Hilbert schemes of 
points on projective surfaces, techniques of vertex
              algebras, 
quantum cohomology, the moduli spaces of Gieseker semistable
              
bundles on surfaces, and the holomorphic Casson invariants 
for Calabi-Yau
              three folds. The investigation should increase 
the knowledge about the
              relations among Hilbert schemes, vertex 
algebras and quantum cohomology, and
              shed light on stable 
bundles over Calabi-Yau three folds and the S-duality
              conjecture 
from physics in the form formulated by Vafa and
              Witten.

Algebraic geometry studies geometric objects described
              by
polynomial equations. It has been at the central stage
of recent
              confluence between mathematics and physics.
Many of these interactions have
              led to profound improvement in
the understanding of both mathematics and
              physics.
Professor Qin's research areas provide solid mathematical
              
foundation to the physics theories which are vital to explain 
the
              universe.
