Abstract    :
              "Addressing Accessibility in Mathematics, Phase 2" is a three-year Professional
              Development Materials project.  Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC), in
              partnership with CAST, proposes to create professional development materials to
              help teachers enable all students, including those with cognitive, sensory,
              physical and emotional disabilities, to be successful with standards-based,
              middle-school mathematics.

The proposed work is based on a two-year NSF
              "proof of concept" project (Addressing Accessibility in Middle School
              Mathematics, Phase 1). The proposed materials comprise six components: (1) an
              Accessibility Toolkit, (2) Workshop Modules, (3) Collaborative Planning Group
              Resources, (4) an Addressing Accessibility Implementation Guide, (5) a Guide
              for Writing Accessible Mathematics Curriculum, and (6) an Addressing
              Accessibility Website.  The project's audience will be mathematics and
              special-education teachers, school and district leaders,
              professional-development and technical-assistance providers, curriculum
              developers and publishers because each is a key stakeholder in ensuring that
              students with disabilities receive the best possible mathematics education.
