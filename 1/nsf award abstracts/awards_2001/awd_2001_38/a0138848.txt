Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for the development of a multichannel recording
              device that can be used to monitor activity of multiple individual neurons in
              the mammalian brain.  Although it is now accepted by most neuroscientists that
              most brain functions reflect the concerted efforts of many neurons, direct
              demonstrations have been hampered by the limitations of currently available
              technology for single-cell recording from the brain, including the lack of
              automation in electrode placement, a relatively low number of electrodes that
              can be used simultaneously, and a relatively high cost.  The device to be
              developed should significantly improve on the technical limitations of existing
              hardware, while not increasing the cost of the equipment needed .  Important
              features include a low cost manipulator system that can position up to 64
              electrodes independently of each other, a feedback control system that will
              couple positioning of the electrodes to the signals detected by the electrodes,
              and an implant device that allows implanted electrodes to be left in place for
              long-term recording.
