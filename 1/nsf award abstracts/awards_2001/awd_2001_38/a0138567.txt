Abstract    :
              This study seeks to discover the mechanisms that evolution favored in human
              placentas that permit an unborn baby to grow normally, even when there is much
              less oxygen than is present at sea level. The hypothesis is that in people with
              a long evolutionary history at high altitude (Andeans), evolution has favored
              the development of more blood vessels and better transport of nutrients in the
              placenta as compared to women of sea level European ancestry.  The project is
              important because despite profound socioeconomic disadvantages, women who are
              native to high altitude (Andeans, Tibetans) have larger babies and fewer
              complications of pregnancy than women without an evolutionary history of
              residence at high altitude (Europeans, Chinese). The broader merits of the
              proposal include international collaboration with Bolivian scientists and
              training of aspiring scientists in the second-poorest country in the Western
              Hemisphere. The study includes marginalized and under-served Native American
              women in this region, providing them with ultrasound and other prenatal tests
              not available during pregnancy for poor women living in Bolivia.  From a
              broader scientific perspective, the results of this study will point to the
              placental genetic systems most subject to evolutionary natural selection under
              conditions of environmental adversity, and thereby inform scientists about the
              reasons why some babies fail to grow normally during intrauterine life,
              regardless of altitude.
