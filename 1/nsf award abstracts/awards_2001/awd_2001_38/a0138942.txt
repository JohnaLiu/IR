Abstract    :
              AST-0138942
University of Arkansas at Fayetteville

Dr. Sears is awarded
              funds to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates site in space and
              planetary sciences at the recently established Arkansas-Oklahoma Center for
              Space and Planetary Sciences, jointly run by the University of Arkansas,
              Fayetteville and the Oklahoma State University, Stillwater. Twelve students
              from regional schools will be placed into research groups.  The research groups
              at the Center involve chemists, biologists, geologists, physicists and
              mechanical engineers who are interested in the biological and geological
              processes occurring on Mars, the geological evolution of asteroids, and the
              design and construction of equipment to be placed on missions.  Most of the
              research projects will make use of the Andromeda planetary environmental
              chamber recently donated by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to the University
              of Arkansas.  In addition to participating in research projects, the students
              will meet weekly with students from the other campus, visit a local aerospace
              company, and take a field trip to NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston.
