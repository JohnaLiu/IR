Abstract    :
              This application requests partial funding to support the Gordon Conference on
              the
Biology, Chemistry and Evolution of Floral Scent to be held March 3 to 8,
              2002, at the
Ventura Harbortown Resort in Ventura, CA. The primary goal of
              this conference is to
bring together researchers investigating the emergent
              field of floral scent from diverse
disciplines and foster new
              interdisciplinary exchanges and collaborations that will
increase our
              understanding of the evolutionary significance and mechanisms of
              floral
fragrance emission.
The conference will consist of 4 formal sessions,
              each consisting of 6 oral presentations
(including 2 plenary talks by leading
              scientists in the area) and 4 afternoon poster
sessions. The sessions focus on
              the principal disciplinary areas that are at the forefront of
floral scent
              research and include the diverse fields of pollination ecology and
              systematics,
analytical chemistry and methodology, neurophysiology and
              ethology, and biochemistry
and genetic engineering. We have selected invited
              speakers on the basis of their current
activity in the field while also
              striving for a program that has a balance of gender,
includes peoples from
              different ethnicities and countries, and involves young
              promising
investigators.
