Abstract    :
              The project is a collaborative effort between the PI, Jim D. Karam, Ph.D.
              (Tulane University) and Henry M. Krisch, Ph.D. (CNRS, Toulouse, France). The
              purpose of the project is to sequence the genomes of up to 8 divergent members
              of the Myoviridae Family whose virion morphologies resemble phage T4 to varying
              extents. The genomes of the Myoviridae constitute a rich, and yet largely
              unexplored, genetic pool for proteins that play a wide variety of biological
              roles. The wild-type phage strains chosen for analysis infect phylogenetically
              diverse bacterial hosts that inhabit a variety of ecological niches. They
              include three coliphages (RB69, RB49 and RB43) that are distantly related to
              T4, three Aeromonas phages (44RR2.8t, Aeh1, and 25), a Burholderia cepacia
              phage (phage 42) that also infects some Pseudomonads, and an Acinetobacter
              phage (phage 133). It is expected that the project will generate a database and
              experimental tools that will enhance the research activities of evolutionary
              biologists, geneticists, biochemists, and structural biologists. A
              cost-effective agreement has been arranged with Integrated Genomics, Inc. (a
              biotechnology company) to construct genomic libraries for the phage strains of
              interest and to carry out high-throughput sequencing on these libraries. It is
              expected that each genome will receive 6X coverage during the high-throughput
              phase of the project and two subsequent rounds of primer walking to close gaps.
              Annotated sequences will be made available to the scientific community on the
              web (GenBank and Integrated Genomics servers) as soon as 6X coverage is
              obtained and verified. DNA samples and other assistance will be provided to
              potential collaborators and others in the scientific community. Monthly updates
              will be placed in the public databases (at GenBank and Integrated Genomics).
              Also, the project will be used as a backdrop for enhancement of graduate
              courses at Tulane University via instruction in genomics technology and
              bioinformatics. This is a Microbial Genome Sequencing Award funded through a
              collaborative activity between the National Science Foundation and the
              Department of Agriculture Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems.
