Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              (REU) site at Michigan State University, where a previous REU site was funded
              for 1998-2000.  Michael Rathke is the site's Program Director. Thirty-eight
              faculty are available to serve as REU student mentors.  Over the award period
              (2002-2004), ten students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program. 
              The research focus will be synthesis, modeling and characterization of
              materials.  The institution's DREW program will be used to assist in the
              recruitment of minority students.  Activities include weekly brown bag luncheon
              meetings, weekly seminars, field trip to Dow Chemical, and participation in a
              regional REU mini-meeting poster session.  Written feedback is provided at the
              end of the program from both the student participants and the research mentors.
               The students will be tracked for several years following the program with a
              series of questionnaires.  The publications that result from REU participation
              are monitored.
