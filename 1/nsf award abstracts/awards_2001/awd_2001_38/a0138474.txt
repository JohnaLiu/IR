Under this Investigator Initiated Award, the PI will focus on
              assessing the effect that human neutrophil/leukocyte (PMN) adhesion to melanoma
              cells has on melanoma cell adhesion and transmigration across endothelium,
              i.e., tumor cell extravasation.  Evidence suggests that leukocytes assist tumor
              cell adhesion and transmigration.  Studies will be performed in a novel flow
              chamber that permits examination of the effect of flow on tumor cell
              attachment.   The four aims are:  1) to characterize the role of tumor-elicited
              leukocytes in dynamic tumor cell extravasation, 2) to identify tumor-secreted
              chemokines associated with PMN recruitment and determine their ability to
              assist with tumor extravasation under flow conditions, 3) to determine
              hydrodynamic shear effect on adhesion efficiency in tumor-leukocyte interaction
              and 4) to foster education/teaching through the application of engineering
              principles to cell biology.
