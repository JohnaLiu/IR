Description:  This award supports research experiences in
              India for graduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
               The opportunity for students to conduct research is a new component of MIT's
              international program in India, which currently supports experiences in
              industry and teaching.  Funding from NSF's Office of International Science &
              Engineering will enable four MIT graduate students to do research at some of
              India's leading centers of research and higher education.  The program is
              designed to integrate them into groundbreaking research at India's finest
              institutions, allow them to explore careers in research, and finally, to give
              them global experience early on in their education and training.  

Scope: 
              The PI is well connected with Indian institutions/researchers and has recently
              completed a term as visiting professor at the Nehru Centre for Advanced
              Studies, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore.  His collaborations
              with Indian colleagues at the IISc, the Indian Institute of Information
              Technology, the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, and the National Centre
              for Biological Sciences have led to the development of opportunities for
              students in leading edge areas of telecommunications, information technology,
              genomics, and neurobiology.  In addition to providing a unique research
              experience for MIT graduate students, it contributes to creating a
              globally-engaged workforce.
