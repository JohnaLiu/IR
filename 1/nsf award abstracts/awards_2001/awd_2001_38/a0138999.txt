Abstract    :
              With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor
              Charles Campbell and his coworkers at the University of Washington are
              measuring the detailed adsorption and reaction energetics of small molecules
              and metal atoms adsorbed on well-characterized metal and semiconductor
              surfaces.  Using a unique microcalorimetric approach, adsorption energies and
              bond strengths of metal-carbon and metal-oxygen bonds are determined. 
              Adsorption and interaction of larger, more complex organic species are also
              examined.  This accurate data is useful in developing an understanding of the
              reaction mechanisms relevant to heterogeneous catalysis, chemical vapor
              deposition processes, and adhesion at solid surfaces.  

The strength of a
              chemical bond between an adsorbed molecule and a solid surface is a crucial
              piece of information for developing an understanding of technologically
              important processes such as heterogeneous catalysis and electronic device
              manufacture.  This information is very difficult to obtain in a direct way. 
              Professor Campbell and coworkers at the University of Washington have developed
              a unique microcalorimetric approach to obtaining this information that has been
              applied to a wide range of important surface chemical systems.  With the
              support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, these important
              measurements will continue and be extended to organic molecules interacting
              with metal and semiconductor surfaces.
