Abstract    :
              This award will support two years of work to plan and implement a national
              conference of approximately 30 participants representing the major
              research-based natural history museums in America to consider best practices
              for enhancing museum visitor understanding of evolution.  Evolution is the
              central paradigm of the life sciences, and natural history museums are of
              fundamental importance to an understanding of the paradigm of evolution. 
              Despite this fact, recent surveys indicate that the majority of the American
              public, including visitors to natural history museums, neither understands nor
              believes in evolutionary theory.  The three-day conference to be held at the
              Florida Museum of Natural History in 2003 will be preceded by a pre-conference
              planning workshop in 2002 and a synthesis of literature and practices pertinent
              to the understanding of evolution in museums.  The conference will bring
              together chief scientists, directors of education and exhibits, and directors
              of research and collections as participants in a program professionally
              facilitated by informal science education experts.  Findings and outcomes of
              the conference will constitute 'best practices' for the field and will be
              published in the professional literature and disseminated via the Florida
              Museum website.  With more than 10,000,000 visitors to natural history museums
              per year, once implemented in museum exhibitions and programs the results of
              this conference will have a broad impact on science literacy in America for
              years to come.
