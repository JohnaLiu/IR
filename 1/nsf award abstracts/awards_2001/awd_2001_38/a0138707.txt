This three-year award for US-France collaboration in
              materials research involves researchers and students at the University of
              Cincinnati and at the University Pierre and Marie Curie (Paris VI) and the
              High-T Laboratory in Orleans of the French National Center for Scientific
              Research (CNRS).  Punit Boolchand in the US and Richard Kerner in France lead
              this team of theorists and experimentalists.  The research addresses structural
              studies of oxide glasses.  The objective is to develop models to predict
              thermal and structural properties. Alkali silicate glasses will be prepared;
              their thermal and spectroscopic properties compared and contrasted; and
              constraint and stochastic agglomeration theories applied to the experimental
              results.  The US investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in
              synthesis of glasses and spectroscopy and constraint theory.  This is
              complemented by French theoretical expertise in modeling glass structure and
              access to high temperature glass preparation facilities in Orleans.
 
This
              award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the CNRS. 
              NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigators and
              graduate students.  CNRS will support visits by French researchers and graduate
              students to the United States. The research will advance understanding of the
              thermal and structural properties of oxide glasses and their commercial
              applications as silica fibers for optical communications and for silicon
              microelectronic device fabrication.  The project will advance doctoral thesis
              research of US and French graduate students, who will actively participate in
              the synthesis, characterization of oxide glasses, and analysis of experimental
              results.
