Abstract    :
              The goal of this three-year project is to model the development of children's
              multiplicative reasoning in urban classrooms in grades K-5.  The project
              proposes to analyze teacher-student interactions during instruction to
              understand how students' productions (e.g., strategies, invented notations,
              arguments, claims, and explanations) are used for collective construction of
              complex mathematical knowledge that can lead to enhanced student outcomes.  The
              project proposes, through observation at elementary classrooms in urban,
              low-income schools, to: (1) identify and classify teacher-student interactions
              that help generate student productions and the sequence that lead to
              significant mathematical understandings and practices; and (2) create models of
              thinking - a space of possible teaching and learning actions - that can help
              teachers adapt or reproduce effective teaching actions.  The models created
              will be tested with other teachers in the last phase of the study.  The
              research will use two types of cases: longitudinal cases of the development of
              individual student's thinking, and cross-sectional cases in which the focus is
              the sequence of teacher-student interactions.  A secondary goal is to
              understand how children's reasoning about the strand of multiplicative
              structures - including fractions, rations, proportions, and multiplication and
              division - become integrated.
