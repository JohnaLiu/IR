It is proposed to carry
              out a combined experimental and analytical investigation on the suppression or
              enhancement of wave motion in film flows.  There are five objectives of this
              research, three are in the experimental part, and two in the analytical part. 
              The experimental objectives are (1) to see if suppression of onset of
              instability as predicted theoretically by the PI can be achieved, (2) whether
              enhancement of wave motion can be realized as predicted, and (3) to demonstrate
              experimentally that the Squire's theorem can be violated.  Objective (4) is to
              extend the stability theory to a multilayer system, and (5) to investigate the
              weakly nonlinear effects of the wave motion. Broader impacts of the proposed
              research was not discussed explicitly by the PI, but three graduate students
              will be trained per year.
