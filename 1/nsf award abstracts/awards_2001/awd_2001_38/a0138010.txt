This is a collaborative proposal among Principal
              Investigators at the Universities of Colorado and Iceland.  Iceland is situated
              at the boundary between cold, polar air masses and relatively warm air masses
              of tropical origin and between the cold, relatively fresh East Greenland
              Current and the warm, salty North Atlantic Drift. Subtle shifts in either
              atmospheric or oceanic circulation may have produced strong changes in the
              terrestrial environment. Therefore, the impact of North Atlantic Holocene
              circulation variability was likely to be stronger on Iceland than most other
              North Atlantic landmasses. There has been a historical record of environmental
              change on Iceland since its settlement and the large variations observed
              confirm Iceland's climate sensitivity.  The goal of the project is to
              reconstruct Iceland's large ice caps through the present interglacial and
              document abrupt shifts that occurred during deglaciation, and the magnitude,
              timing and possible cyclicity of terrestrial environmental change.  The
              Principal Investigators will attempt to answer two specific questions: 1) did
              some of the extant large ice caps disappear in the early Holocene, and if so,
              when did they regrow and 2) what were the terrestrial and near-shore
              environmental conditions during deglaciation?  Continuous cores from two deep,
              high-sedimentation-rate lake basins will be recovered.  These lakes were
              selected because the sediments are expected to provide high-resolution,
              quantitative evidence of environmental change over the past 10 to 15 thousand
              years.  The Principal Investigators will undertake a multiproxy approach, with
              an emphasis on physical characteristics of the sediments, lacustrine primary
              productivity changes, palynology, and marine micropaleontology. These data
              should allow them to determine whether there is a natural cyclicity in Holocene
              environmental change on Iceland, similar to that reported from the adjacent
              oceans and the Greenland Ice Sheet.
