The proposed research will be devoted to further studies on
              the foundation
of the theory of irreversible processes in fluid systems. Such
              processes
include viscous and thermal flows as well as diffusive motion,
              chemical
reactions, in both classical and quantum systems. Recent work by the
              PI
and co-workers has shown that for most systems of interest, there is
              an
underlying chaotic dynamics which can be viewed as the source of
              the
irreversibility. The sensitivity of the motion of a chaotic system
              of
particles to the precise values of the initial conditions of the
              particles
reflects itself as an apparent randomness in the dynamics of the
              system.
Current research is devoted to a study of entropy production and
              related
irreversible phenomena in classically chaotic systems, as well as to
              the
quantum mechanical versions of the systems and their processes.
              This
latter direction is stimulated in part by recent work by many authors
              on
the quantum behavior of classically chaotic systems which can
              be
fruitfully applied to a study of irreversibility in quantum systems.

              Finally, work will be carried out to determine the analogous
properties of
              non-chaotic systems, or of mixed chaotic and non-chaotic
systems, with
              transport to study the modifications of the theory needed to
treat such
              systems, as well.
