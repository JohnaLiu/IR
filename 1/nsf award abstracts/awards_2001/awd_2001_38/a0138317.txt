Gary, Dale E.

A  2 year study to investigate the technical
              challenges for constructing a new technology, frequency agile solar radio
              telescope called FASR will be conducted.   The science measurement requirements
              for three key science areas: 1. coronal magnetography, 2. solar flares 3.
              particle acceleration, and space weather will be used to develop the instrument
              system functional requirements. The proposal contains detailed task lists,
              personnel assignments, areas of study, and an initial management plan. An
              initial design study is the deliverable.  Products from the design study will
              be an improved cost and schedule estimates and a better understanding of the
              engineering and technology scope of FASR telescope and instrument system.
