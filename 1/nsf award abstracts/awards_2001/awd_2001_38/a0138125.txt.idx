Abstract    :
              0138125 Wilson  The Naval Support Force Antarctica (familiar name: Operation
              Deep Freeze) was the major provider of station and field operations, logistics,
              and direct science support for NSF-funded research in Antarctica from 1954
              until 31 March 1998, when the Department of Defense transferred military
              support of the U.S. Antarctic Program to the U.S. Air Force.  Throughout its
              44 years of existence, the Naval Support Force Antarctica produced and
              published annual end-of-season reports that contain authoritative narratives
              and statistics regarding its activities.  The reports were published on paper;
              electronic copies do not exist.  A collaboration of the Naval Research
              Laboratory Library, the Naval History Office, and NSF's Office of Polar
              Programs assembled a full set of paper copies of the reports.  The Document
              Automation & Production Service, Defense Logistics Agency, will digitize them
              and make CD-ROM copies. NSF will distribute the CD-ROMs as needed, and the
              files will be available to the public.
