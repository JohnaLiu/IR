The Multichannel Astrometric Photometer
              (MAP) at the Thaw Refractor of the University of Pittsburgh will be upgraded to
              extend the magnitude limit from its current level of twelve to fifteen and will
              be upgraded to increase its precision by a factor of two better than the
              current system. Precise, relative astrometry to a few milliarcseconds for a
              night's observing will be enabled.  Unique aspects of the instrument include: a
              Ronchi grating scanned across the star field to modulate the stellar flux,
              angular distances between stars measured using the phase of the resulting
              signals, and the replacement of the old photomultipliers with avalanche
              photodiodes.
