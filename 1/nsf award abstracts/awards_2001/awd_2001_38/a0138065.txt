In this project, we investigate a three-dimensional
              geometric 
problem that originated in neural maps, which model the 
motions
              of neurons so as to understand the human behavior. 
The problem is defined as
              follows: given a neuron, which is 
modeled as a polyhedron, compute a minimum
              set of (minimal) 
cylindrical segments to approximate the neuron. We plan to
              
design a good approximation for this problem (i.e., the error 
between the
              cylindrical segments and the neuron is small).
We also plan to have a good
              implementation, build a prototype 
system, and perform extensive empirical
              studies. Practically, 
a solution to this problem will have a great impact in
              
computational biology.  Theoretically, this problem generalizes 
the problem
              of finding a single line stabbing a set of balls 
in 3D (and has never been
              seriously studied to the best of our knowledge).

Modeling the motions of
              human neurons is an important problem 
in biology, especially in understanding
              human behavior under 
different circumstances.  To do that, we first need to
              model 
a single neuron, which is very much like a tree-shaped 
polyhedron,
              using a set of cylindrical segments. Different
cylindrical segments of
              different radii have different 
functionality, so the union of the cylindrical
              segments 
should be as close to the neuron as possible. In practice 
this
              problem is estimated manually by technicians in
the computational biology
              community. The process is 
time-consuming and error-prone. Our research will
              focus 
on automating this process with computers and a successful 
solution
              will have deep influence in the computational 
biology community. We will
              train two graduate students
throughout this project.
