Abstract    :
              In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Klemperer will investigate the properties of relatively
              strong bound molecular complexes in their ground electronic state, but excited
              to high energies in the range between 10,000 and 15,000 cm-1. This work will
              provide quantitative data on the potential energy surfaces of hydrogen bonded
              molecular complexes. Studies will be performed on complexes formed with He and
              H2, the rotational spectroscopy of high-energy isomers will be carried out, and
              the spectroscopy of high overtones will be pursued.

This research will
              develop new areas of the spectroscopy of hydrogen bonded molecular complexes.
              Students and postdoctoral research associates will participate in this work. 
              They will receive training in theoretical and experimental techniques of high
              resolution molecular spectroscopy in preparation for advanced studies or entry
              into the scientific/technological workforce.
