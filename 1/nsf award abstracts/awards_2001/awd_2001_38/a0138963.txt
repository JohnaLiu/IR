Abstract    :
              Professor Christa Colyer of Wake Forest University is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to perform studies on the use of
              noncovalent dye labels for protein detection by Laser Induced Fluorescence
              (LIF) after seperation by capillary electrophoresis (CE).  LIF detection
              requires labeling of proteins with fluorescent dyes.  The proposed work aims to
              label proteins noncovalently using dyes that are excited by near infrared
              photons, allowing the eventual use of cheap laser diodes aboard microchip CE.  
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                           Seperation and quantitation of proteins, epecially
              from ultrasmall volumes, represents a particular challenge in analytical
              chemistry.  CE requires only nanoliters of sample and so is appropriate for
              investigating the fluids of single cells.  The methods are of great use in the
              investigation of proteomics.
