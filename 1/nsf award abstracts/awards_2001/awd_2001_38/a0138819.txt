Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to support teacher retention and renewal through
              professional development institutes for two cohorts of rural teachers over 42
              months.  The first cadre will consist of 56 teachers, 28 from North Carolina
              and 28 from Illinois, constituting 7 teams in each state.  The second cadre
              will consist of 104 middle and high school mathematics and science teachers
              from North Carolina and Illinois, 52 from each of the two states.  Thus there
              are 13 teams from North Carolina and 13 teams from Illinois in each cadre.  The
              following workshops and institutes will be conducted:  Summer Institutes
              2002-2005; Fall Workshops, 2004-2005; and Spring Workshops, 2003-2006.

The
              project addresses four interrelated elements for the revitalization of rural
              communities:  1) building and sustaining a community of master teachers who
              support novice teachers through mentoring programs; 2) providing resources and
              training to develop teachers' use of visualization technologies and content
              expertise to create pedagogically sound conceptual models for student learning;
              3) enhancing standards-based curricula through the use of visualization
              technologies to encourage student engagement; and 4) developing a sustainable
              and scalable model that continues to assist teachers to become effective
              leaders and agents of change.
