Abstract    :
              Computational approaches to handle the vast amounts of information in biology
              are increasingly important for deriving and evaluating hypotheses.  Information
              management techniques to assemble a variety of different data are necessary.  A
              proteomic database will be developed as a bioinformatics framework for genomic
              and proteomic studies.  The integrated Protein Classification (iProClass)
              database will contain core components for the presentation of composite views
              of data that will include protein sequence, superfamily, motif and structure. 
              All reports for each protein sequence will contain extensive cross-references
              and links.  The system will be freely distributed view web and mirror sites and
              provide a resource for exploration of many features involving information from
              a number of sources.  The modular and open architecture of the database will
              promote data integration in a distributed networking environment.
