              ABSTRACT

"Stories from the Circle: Science and Native Wisdom," 
A Workshop
              with Extensive Dissemination Materials


A workshop entitled "Stories from
              the Circle: Science and Native Wisdom," will be held at the Tsaile campus of
              Dine College, near Chinle, Arizona on May 13-18 of 2002. This is the first
              major gathering of Native scientists, scholars, and elders with Western
              scientists and scholars that is to be planned, organized, and carried out
              within Native, rather than Western, worldview.  Extensive dissemination through
              a film, books, a museum exhibition, and curriculum materials is an integral
              part of this project. These means of dissemination will allow the workshop's
              objectives to be widely communicated. The objectives of the workshop are to
              make a statement about science from a Native cultural perspective and to show
              the dominant culture another way of looking at the world that can help solve
              some serious problems we all face. The workshop and dissemination materials are
              being planned by teams of Native scholars and scientists from many nations, in
              collaboration with selected non-Native scholars and scientists.
