Abstract    :
              
This award provides support for a project focused on the development of a
              novel software package, Virtual NMR Spectrometer, for accurate and efficient
              computer calculation of the outcome of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
              experiments. As NMR experiments grow more elaborate it becomes increasingly
              difficult to predict the resulting spectra analytically. These difficulties are
              particularly great for spin systems of high complexity typical of biological
              macromolecules.  The Virtual Spectrometer will be capable of simulating all
              contemporary experimental NMR approaches, including multichannel,
              multidimensional experiments involving shaped radio-frequency pulses and pulsed
              field gradients. The software will provide a powerful tool for designing new
              NMR approaches and for optimizing pulse sequences and experimental conditions
              prior to running NMR experiments. The Virtual NMR Spectrometer will also serve
              as an efficient tool for learning the general principles of magnetic resonance
              spectroscopy and for training students and novice users in pulse sequence
              design and data processing. In contrast to the existing software, use of the
              virtual spectrometer will not require computer programming skills. This will
              permit a variety of users with variedbackgrounds to use this program for
              learning purposes and/or for improvement in design of experiments using NMR.
