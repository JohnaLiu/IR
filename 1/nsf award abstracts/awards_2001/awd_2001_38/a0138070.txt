Proposal Title: GOALI: High Throughput Activity and in-situ FTIR and EXAFS
              Studies of the Effect of Sulfur on Noble Metal Supported Oxidation

The objective of this proposal is
              to investigate the effects of sulfur on the state of the surface of supported
              platinum, palladium, and rhodium catalysts and to develop structure-activity
              correlations for these catalysts during oxidation reaction.  The approach is to
              conduct a comprehensive study on the effect of sulfur poisoning on model
              oxidation reactions by combining kinetic measurements, catalyst
              characterizations, and microkinetic and Monte Carlo simulations of the
              experimental results.  High throughput catalyst evaluations will be used to
              ascertain the effect of sulfur on carbon monoxide, propane, and proplyene
              oxidation on Pt, Pd, and Rh on a variety of oxide supports.  An array of
              catalysts will be used to identify the major trends in activity caused by
              sulfur poisoning of the catalysts' surface.  Selected samples will be studied
              using a variety of surface analytical techniques such as EXAFS and FTIR.  An
              industrial collaborator brings expertise in surface science and catalyst
              preparation techniques.  The results of this study may be useful in developing
              more sulfur-tolerant catalysts in automobile exhaust applications and for fuel
              cells.
