Abstract    :
              "A Distance Learning Model for High School Statistics Teachers" proposes a
              collaboration between the American Statistical Association, university faculty
              (Cal Poly and UCLA), and secondary teachers to develop and pilot a sequence of
              two courses for high school mathematics teachers whose training has not
              adequately prepared them to teach statistics.  The primary professional
              development resource currently available for enhancing statistics knowledge is
              a weeklong workshop, which lacks a mechanism for continued learning and
              sustained support.

By combining a workshop with a yearlong distance
              education component, this project provides a model of professional development
              in content areas mandated by curricular change.  More specifically, the project
              will have two parts:  a Content Course and a Practicum Course.  The two courses
              have a common format comprised of a weeklong workshop followed by a yearlong,
              online distance learning component.  Both courses also include additional
              components.

This three-year project will enroll a total of 108 high-school
              teachers.  Upon completion of the project, efforts will be focused on the
              dissemination of (1) the content course and (2) a model for improving teacher
              qualifications in other SMET content areas undergoing curricular change, such
              as physics and chemistry.
