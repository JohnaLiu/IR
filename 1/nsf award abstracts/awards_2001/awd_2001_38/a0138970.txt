Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Clarkson University for the support of a
              three-year REU in Environmental Sciences and Engineering under the direction of
              Dr. Stefan J. Grimberg.  This 10-week summer program will provide seven
              undergraduate students with the opportunity to conduct independent research
              within the area of sustainable management of environmental systems with the
              assistance of a faculty mentor.  In addition, the students will participate in
              research group meetings, write a report, present their work at a
              University-wide undergraduate research symposium and will be encouraged to
              publish their work in peer reviewed publications.
