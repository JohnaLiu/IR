Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              (REU) site at the University of South Dakota.  Andrew Sykes is the site's
              Program Director. Six faculty from the Departments of Biology and Chemistry
              will serve as REU student mentors.  Over the award period (2002-2004), four
              students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program.  The recruitment
              focus will be directed towards regional undergraduate institutions and a
              minimum of one student of Native American descent will participate in the
              program each year.  The research activity focuses on photodynamics.  Weekly
              meetings will be held, where students present their research and at the end of
              the summer students will submit written reports and make a formal
              presentations.  Students will submit abstracts to the National Conference on
              Undergraduate Research.  At the end of the program students and research
              mentors will each complete an evaluation form.  All participants will be
              tracked until they complete their undergraduate educations.
