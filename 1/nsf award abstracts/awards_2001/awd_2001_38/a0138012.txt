Abstract    :
              This award supports the development of an improved version of an oxygen
              electrode that is expected to have an oxygen sensitivity five orders of
              magnitude greater than that of commercially available electrodes of similar
              type, as well as an improved response time.  The instrument will also have
              fluorescence excitation and detection capabilities.  The instrument is expected
              to facilitate studies of photosynthetic reaction mechanisms, permitting the
              determination of the redox state and charge transfer kinetics of photosynthetic
              cofactors in the microsecond time range.  In addition to these scientific
              goals, the project is expected to have a significant impact on training of
              graduate and undergraduate students.
