Description:  This award provides travel support for 20
              American participants at the US-India Workshop: Viscous Liquids and the Glass
              Transition, Bangalore, India, January 2002.  US PI Austen Angell, Arizona State
              University and Srikanth Sastry and Chandan Dasgupta, Indian Institute of
              Science, are organizers for a workshop on transition from mobile liquid to
              glassy solid, a subject of much current debate and an important unsolved
              problem of condensed matter physics.  They will convene leading international
              physicists and experts in the related areas of granular matter, foams, spin
              glasses and vortex glasses to discuss problem boundaries and explore a series
              of well-defined themes.  US participants were selected on the basis of their
              valuable contributions to this research area and for their importance to future
              progress.  The scope of the workshop is exploration of six themes that have
              generated the current wave of interest on glass transition in structural
              glasses.  

Scope:  The US PI is one of the world's leading scientists in
              this field.  Some of the most active contributing scientists to research in
              this field are Indian nationals.  The workshop will take advantage of the
              presence in India of theorists attending concurrent statistical physics and
              condensed matter physics conferences.  The Indian Institute of Science,
              Bangalore, the workshop venue, has a long history of achievement in physics and
              materials research, including those of Indian Nobel Laureate C.V. Raman and CNR
              Rao.  Indian hosts will meet local costs for US participants; the Office of
              International Science and Engineering and the Division of Materials Research
              jointly support this activity.
