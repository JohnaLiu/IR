The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is a concept for a
              very large new radio telescope with a collecting area of one square kilometer,
              covering wavelengths in the meter and centimeter range.  It is being conceived
              as an international project, with competing designs emerging in Europe,
              Australia, China, and the US.  This project will develop a US design concept to
              be presented to the International SKA Steering Committee in 2005.  The Steering
              Committee will review all submitted designs and choose one for adoption and
              further development by the international community.  The funded program will
              develop the US concept of many thousands of relatively small radio telescopes
              spread over a wide area, acting together as an interferometeric array.  The
              timeframe for completion of the SKA, should it ultimately be funded, is around
              2015-2020.   Therefore the proposed work falls in the realm of an initial
              concept definition and feasibility study.  
The astronomical community
              endorsed SKA technology development by listing it high in priority under
              Moderate Initiatives in the most recent NRC Decadal Survey report.
