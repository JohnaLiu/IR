This award to Oregon State University provides instrumentation
              to significantly improve the oceanographic research capabilities of the
              institution and the research vessel Wecoma, an NSF-owned ship operated by OSU
              as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research
              fleet.  The award supports acquisition of a phased array 75 kHz acoustic
              current profiler that is expected to significantly improve the R/V Wecoma's
              capabilities for measuring currents.  It also provides upgrades to the piston
              corers of the NORCOR facility and improvements to the shipboard computer
              network on R/V Wecoma.  All of these are shared-use capabilities that are
              available to all funded users of the R/V Wecoma, or in the case of the coring
              systems, users of any UNOLS vessel.  These improvements will be of substantial
              advantage to marine scientists during 2002 and future years.
