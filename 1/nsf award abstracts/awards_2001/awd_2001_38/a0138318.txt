Walker, Chris

Advanced technology in the areas of mixers, device
              fabrication, micro machining, digital signal processing, and telescope design
              and engineering will be innovatively integrated to create the first integrated
              submillimeter heterodyne arrays. These arrays will utilize the latest Nb and
              Nb-AU diffusion cooled hot electron bolometers (HEB) in an efficient
              micromachined waveguide mount. These arrays will be used first at the 10-meter
              Heinrich Hertz Telescope (HHT) operated by the University of Arizona. 

This
              work will take place at the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory where
              post doctoral and graduate and undergraduate students will participate.
