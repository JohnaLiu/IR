Abstract    :
              Alfven waves and the field-aligned electric currents associated with them form
              the primary basis for the electromagnetic coupling between the magnetosphere
              and the ionosphere.  This project will use a particle-in-cell (PIC) computer
              code to perform kinetic simulations of the interaction of Alfven waves with
              gradients and structures in the ionosphere.  The topics to be studied include
              the interaction with pre-existing density cavities, nonlinear reflections from
              boundaries, modulations produced by double-layers, the generation of
              high-frequency noise and the effects of cross-field plasma flows.
