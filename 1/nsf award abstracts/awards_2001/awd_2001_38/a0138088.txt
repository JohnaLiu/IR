Abstract    :
              This proposal outlines a two-year course of study to fully analyze and
              synthesize petrologic and geochemical data together with geologic and
              geophysical constraints to come up with fully integrated models of melting,
              melt ascent, plumbing and eruptive systems at the fast-spreading EPR 8 degrees
              -10 degrees N. The PI will collaborate with geologists and geophysicists at
              IPGP in Paris and WHOI. Distinct goals include using existing and new analyses
              to understand the mantle sources, melting, and fractionation of the axial and
              off-axis basalts, using gabbroic xenoliths, U-series dating, and geologic
              information to paint a picture of layer 2a thickening and the role of off-axis
              eruptions, and to evaluate the correlations between U-series ages, magnetic
              paleointensity values, and volcanic and geomorphic features. This ABR will
              bring together a decade of sampling and analytical work to produce a fully
              integrated interpretive model of crustal growth and evolution at fast spreading
              rates.
