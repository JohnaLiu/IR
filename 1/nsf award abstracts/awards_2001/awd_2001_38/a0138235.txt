Silicon immersion gratings for astronomical
              applications in the infrared for wavelengths between 1 and 10-microns will be
              developed for telescope projects requiring spectral resolutions between 1,000
              and 100,000.  Immersing the grating in Silicon, which as an index of refraction
              of 3.4 in the infrared will enable much higher solid-angle throughput or etendu
              than is now possible for an instrument of smaller volume and mass.  
              Spectrographs used on telescopes must be moved during the observations; either
              swinging through the sky at a Cassegrain or equivalent focus or rotating at a
              Nysmyth platform (to compensate for rotating field during exposure).  Large
              heavy instruments present serious engineering challenges for cryogenic
              operation. Use of silicon immersion gratings will enable lighter-weight
              higher-performance instruments for cutting edge scientific research. The first
              astronomical observations will be on the Lick 3-meter telescope.
