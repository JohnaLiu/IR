This award supports research concerned
              with the algorithmic
representation of cell complexes, a special type of
              
topological space.  These complexes arise as topological 
models of data and
              processes in science and engineering.   
Specific applications of interest are
              to biological, social, 
and communications networks, as well as to problems in
              
statistics.  Topological invariants of the complexes provide 
measures of
              certain characteristics of the processes 
producing the data.  The use of cell
              complexes as data 
models represents a new application of these structures
              
to science and engineering network problems.  

The methods employed
              include tools from computational 
algebra, combinatorics, and combinatorial
              topology, thereby 
making a contribution to the applicability of new
              mathematical 
areas to some pressing and challenging applied problems. 
              
Research results will be disseminated directly to the end 
user outside the
              mathematical community.  The project impacts 
a number of graduate students,
              including students from 
underrepresented groups.
