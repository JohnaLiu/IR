Description: This project supports a US-Bangladesh Workshop
              on Water and Environment in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta to be held in
              Dhaka, Bangladesh, January 28-31, 2002.  The organizers are Dr. Shafiqul Islam,
              Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Cincinnati,
              Cincinnati, Ohio, Dr. Charles Harvey, Department of Civil and Environmental
              Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts,
              and Dr. C.S. Karim, Member, Physical Science, Bangladesh Atomic Energy
              Commission.  The workshop is to explore the issues of long-term sustainability
              of water resources and environments in the Ganges- Brahmaputtra- Meghna (GBM)
              Delta.  The workshop will focus on five areas: 1) Geology and Hydrogeology of
              the GBM Delta, 2) Biology and Ecology, 3) Water Resources, Irrigation &
              Environmental Aspects, 4) Arsenic Contamination in a Tropical Delta, 5)
              Socioeconomic Aspects of Population Dynamics and Agriculture.  The workshop
              goals are to explore areas of mutual interest for international collaborative
              research on the GBM delta, identify and prioritize key research questions
              within each thematic area, and disseminate information through the workshop
              proceedings and web based publications.

Scope: This project enables US and
              Bangladesh scientists to participate in a workshop to discuss an area of
              importance to both countries and to identify potential collaborative research. 
              Dr. Islam and Dr. Harvey are currently conducting research on arsenic
              contamination of well water in Bangladesh.  The other US participants include
              well-respected scientists with long experience in the river network in south
              Asia.  The Bangladesh delegation is being selected by Dr. Karim with the
              supervision of the Ministry of Science and Technology.  The project meets INT
              objectives in supporting mutually beneficial joint workshops. This project is
              jointly supported by the Office of International Science and Engineering, the
              Division of Earth Sciences, the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences,
              and the Division of Bioengineering and Environmental Systems.
