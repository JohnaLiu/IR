Abstract    :
              An ongoing observational record of nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, total
              peroxynitrates, total alkylnitrates, nitric acid, and total odd nitrogen (NOy)
              at the University of California Blodgett Forest Research Station will be
              extended. The PI has developed a novel instrument based on thermal dissociation
              - laser-induced fluorescence (TD-LIF) with four channels. In addition, the PI
              plans to measure UV irradiance. Through collaborations, measurements of ozone,
              hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide will be available. Box- and
              1-dimensional modeling will be used to understand and interpret past and
              ongoing measurements. Furthermore, the PI intends to demonstrate the capability
              of his instrument for carrying out eddy-covariance flux measurements, and then
              carry out a full annual cycle of measurements. 

This project, if successful,
              will demonstrate new technology for trace gas concentration and flux
              measurements, and will provide new insights into the photochemistry of forested
              areas that are partially impacted by anthropogenic pollution.
