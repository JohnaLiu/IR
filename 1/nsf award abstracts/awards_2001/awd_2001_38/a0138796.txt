Abstract    :
              The Delaware Science Coalition is a systemic partnership consisting of higher
              education, businesses, the Delaware Department of Education (DOE) and local
              districts.  With this proposal they are continuing their collaboration to
              expand their prior K-8 efforts into high schools.  

The pilot proposal will
              initially be limited to a focus on improving the science program in the 9th and
              10th grades.  Ten schools (45 teachers) representing the statewide range of
              geographic distribution, demographic characteristics and size of student body
              will be active participants in the process of developing models of successful
              classroom practice.  These schools will be charged with the responsibility of
              designing an educational system that recognizes their particular
              characteristics and needs.  Common features of models for the selection of
              instructional materials and teacher professional development are anticipated
              and lessons learned from this pilot will serve to scale up the project to
              inform the future development of a comprehensive statewide LSC.
