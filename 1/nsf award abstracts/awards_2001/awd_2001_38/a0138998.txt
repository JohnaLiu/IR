              Freight Flow Data for Analysis and Planning

This grant will support
              preliminary explorations in integrating 10 datasets, some digital and some
              paper, related to the modeling of the flow of freight carried by trucks, rail,
              and ship in the greater Los Angeles area.  The collaboration will be between
              information scientists and experts in transportation planning and policy and
              will involve the collaboration of several government agencies.
