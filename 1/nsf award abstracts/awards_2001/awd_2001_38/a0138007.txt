Abstract    :
              This award supports an effort to develop a miniaturized and integrated
              two-dimensional (2-D) protein separation platform based on non-native
              isoelectric focusing and SDS gel electrophoresis in a microfluidic network. The
              network will be embedded in a small plastic chip, and the device will employ
              laser-induced fluorescence for the detection of resolved SDS-protein complexes
              in the microchannel array using non-covalent, environment-sensitive,
              fluorescent probes. The resulting instrumentation system will be capable of
              analyzing complex mixtures of proteins, including crude cell lysates containing
              minute quantities of protein.  In addition, the device will be amenable to much
              greater automation, throughput, and sensitivity than existing gel-based
              systems. This microfluidics-based instrumentation technology, positioned as the
              next generation of 2-D poly acrylimide gel electrophoresis, promises to have a
              major impact on proteomics research, particularly in comparisons of protein
              expression in organisms growing under different conditions.
