Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Montana State University for a three year, REU
              Site at the Center for Biofilm Engineering, under the direction of Dr. Anne
              Camper.  This twelve-week summer program will involve eight students annually
              in individual biofilm research projects. In addition, the participants will
              receive training in technical presentations and writing, give oral
              presentations throughout the summer, write a final research report, and learn
              about ethics in research through seminars and industry field trips.
