Abstract    :
              There are two main research directions in this project.
The first one is the
              continuation of the work on a 
general theory of boundary values, in the sense
              of 
analytic functionals or hyperfunctions. In its present 
state this theory
              has clarified several points in the
study of boundary values of functions, in
              particular
viz the intrinsic character of the definitions. Points
which they
              have clarified in the global setting need
further study in the local version.
              A theory in the 
non real analytic setting is still to be done. The 
second
              direction is at the confluent of pluri-potential
theory and complex geometry.
              A still remote goal is
the possible extension of Poletsky's theory of
              disks
to the case of almost complex manifolds, whose role
in Mathematics is
              rapidly growing. It also leads
to the study of approximate solutions to the
              d-bar
operator.

The primary field of this proposal is Several
Complex
              Variables. This field is rich due to its
connections to many fields in
              Mathematics.
There is in particular a remarkable interplay between
Several
              Complex Variables and the theory of
Partial Differential Equations, which
              itself is
the most basic tool in the study of many processes
in Physics and
              Engineering. The first direction discussed
above fits in that setting. In
              applications 
quantitative studies have often to be replaced 
by qualitative
              studies, either because  the
quantitative study is too difficult or because
              the
qualitative study is in fact more illuminating. This
is where the field
              of Topology is essential.
Several important connections exist between
              Several
Complex Variables and Topology.  The second direction
discussed above
              fits in that setting. Deformation theory
is a major theme, in which the study
              of almost complex
structures has already played a crucial role.
