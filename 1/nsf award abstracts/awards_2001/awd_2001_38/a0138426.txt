Scientific measurements and computer
              simulations of 
phenomena like air turbulence, nuclear explosions, or
              
combustion in an engine, when conducted at high-performance 
computing
              facilities, produce vast amounts of four-dimensional 
data representing how
              variables such as temperature and
pressure change over time. This incubation
              project brings 
together researchers at UNC Chapel Hill, Georgia Tech, and
              
Lawrence Livermore National Labs to develop a prototype 
visualization tool
              that can both quickly compute such 
iso-surfaces from such data sets and also
              provide a global 
summary that can indicate where a user should look in the
              
data set to find interesting phenomena.

The approach to be taken  is to
              extend work on contour trees 
to a "Morse theory for a parameterized family of
              functions" 
that is sufficient to visualize 4D data from 2D iso-surfaces 
or
              slices.   When scientists, engineers, and students can 
explore the data that
              comes from simulation, their understanding 
of the process that is being
              simulated can only improve.
This not only increases the return from the
              national 
investment in high-performance computing centers, but can 
also
              result in, for example, cleaner-burning engines.
