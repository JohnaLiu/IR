Abstract    :
              
In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Wodtke will use a new technique to study highly excited
              vibrational states of polyatomic molecules, with energies that bring them close
              to the reaction barrier.  Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) will be used as a prototype
              system and will be studied by the combined techniques of stimulated emission
              pumping and electric hexapole focusing to obtain energy and dipole moment
              information in individual highly excited rotation-vibrational states. Such
              information will serve to better map out the wavefunctions for highly excited
              states especially for isomerizing transitions.

This project addresses a
              major problem in contemporary physical chemistry, namely the characterization
              of molecules in excited states, high enough to affect reactions and
              isomerization transitions. Two separate techniques are combined in a novel way
              to obtain such information. Experiments on the prototype hydrogen cyanide
              molecule will be extended to other systems. The research will provide excellent
              training for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in modern research
              techniques.
