Description:  This award supports a US-India collaboration
              entitled Morphological Properties of the Supercluster-Void Network in the
              Universe.  US PI Sergei Shandarin, University of Kansas  and Varun Sahni,
              Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune will test
              current theories of cosmological structure formation by comparison of the
              statistical properties of the observed universe with those of numerical
              simulations.  This is one of the the major themes of current cosmological
              studies; the collaborators are well-established in studying  large-scale
              structure in the universe.  The PIs will quantify the geometrical properties of
              the supercluster-void network using robust statistical measures called
              Minkowski functionals.  This powerful technique will enable them to determine
              the texture and topology of the global cosmic web, as well as the properties of
              its individual components --clusters, superclusters and voids.    

Scope: 
              The research will develop a software library consisting of sophisticated
              numerical algorithms for studying morphological and geometrical properties of
              large scale structures.  It 
will be made available to the astronomy and
              astrophysics community through the internet.  The tools developed through this
              research have the potential for use in a large number of applications for
              physicists and the larger scientific community.  This research is cofunded by
              the Indian Department of Science & Technology (DST) under the NSF/DST joint
              program.
