Persson, Sven E.

The technical development and acquisition of
              six 2048x2048 HAWAII-2RG detectors for the Carnegie's DEEPSIX instrument to be
              used at Las Campanas will be completed. This is a large format near infrared
              camera for the F5.4 focus of the Magellan II 6.5 meter telescope.  A
              significant fraction of the observing time is dedicated to large area deep
              surveys, including a number of programs carried out in concert with the
              National Optical Astronomy Observatory. A broad cross-section of the US
              community of astronomers will be engaged with this work.
