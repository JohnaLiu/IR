Abstract    :
              This study will derive the thermal conductivity of first-year antarctic sea ice
              as a function of ice microstructure, temperature, temperature gradients,
              salinity, and other environmental parameters. Measurements will be carried out
              by freezing thermistor arrays into the fast ice of McMurdo Sound.  
The
              thermal conductivity of sea ice determines the magnitude of the heat flow
              through the ice, and hence the exchange of heat between the ocean and
              atmosphere, for a given ice temperature gradient.  General circulation models
              (GCMs) and large-scale sea-ice models currently include overly simplistic
              parameterizations of the ice thermal conductivity, developed several decades
              ago, that are likely to contribute significantly to errors in estimating ice
              production rates.
	The results from this work will feed into improved
              parameterizations of sea ice parameters for collaboration with the Sea-Ice
              Model Intercomparison Project (SIMIP2) Team established under the auspices of
              the World Climate Research Program. The research will advance and improve: (1)
              our understanding of processes and parameters controlling heat transfer and
              thermal conductivity of first-year sea ice, (2) measurement techniques for the
              derivation of thermal conductivity and heat flow data from thermistor arrays,
              (3) our understanding of sea-ice processes and heat flow through the ice cover
              in the McMurdo Sound region, (4) parameterizations of thermal conductivity for
              use in large-scale and high-resolution one-dimensional simulations, and (5) the
              representation of first-year ice antarctic and arctic thermal properties in
              GCMs.
