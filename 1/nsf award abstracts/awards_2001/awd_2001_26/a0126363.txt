OPP-0126363

There are a number of surge-type glaciers in
              the central Alaska Range and most 
of them overlying the Denali Fault .  The
              actual occurrence of a surge, however, is rare because of the long recurrence
              time which is about 50-100 years and only three glaciers have been recorded to
              surge repeatedly in this region.  One of these is the Yanert which is known to
              have last surged in 1942.   This is very different from the glaciers in
              southeast Alaska where surges are often repeated in less than twenty years. 
              The exact causes and the behavior of surges are not known, therefore, it is
              important to take advantage of opportunities for more data collection whenever
              it arises.  Unfortunately,  the exact year or time of a surge is very difficult
              to predict and it is impossible to plan for adequate field work in advance.
              

The Yanert Glacier is located in the central Alaska Range, but little is
              known about it other than  it is  a surge-type glacier and a surge had been
              observed in 1942.  The recent surge started in the late winter of 1999/2000,
              but most of it went unnoticed.  In April 2001, it had restarted again and
              developed into a major surge .  Because no surges have been observed to last
              more than two years, the Yanert surge is likely to stop this summer and not
              resume next winter.  The Principal Investigators will  fly to the terminus of
              Yanert Glacier and install two time lapse cameras.  One will observe the surge
              front that is currently about five kilometers from the glacier terminus.  It 
              will be used to measure the rate of advance of the surge front and to establish
              the time when the advance stops. A second camera will be placed in front of the
              glacier. The end of the surge is expected to coincide with a big flood. This
              camera will record if and when the flood occurs.  The Principal Investigators
              will also record the position of the surge front, using hand held GPS units. 
              At the end of the season, they will  fly a profile of the glacier with an
              airborne altimetry system and retrieve the time lapse cameras.  The profile
              will be used to estimate the total mass transport of ice that occurred as a
              result of the surge.
