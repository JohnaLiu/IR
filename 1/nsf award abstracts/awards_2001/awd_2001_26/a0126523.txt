Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)
This project is improving the laboratory experience for our
              students in The Chemistry of High
Polymers. This is being accomplished by the
              introduction of a GPC, coupled with UV and light-scattering detectors, with
              attendant software. Experiments are being adapted from a program at the
              University of Northern Iowa and from the educational literature. These
              instruments allow students to accurately determine synthetic and/or commercial
              polymer's accurate macromolecular characterizations, such as their molecular
              weights, molecular weight distributions and molecular size. The result is that
              we are upgrading and enhancing the laboratory program for an undergraduate
              polymers course that has been offered for the last 26 years. Since it is a
              well-known fact that about 75% of all chemistry majors will work in the
              chemical industry at some time in their careers, and that a vast majority of
              those chemical companies manufacture polymers, many exclusively so, this
              particular course and its laboratory experience are integral to the education
              of chemistry majors who pass through our department. It has proven to be a very
              popular course over the years we have offered it, and most all our chemistry
              majors take it.
