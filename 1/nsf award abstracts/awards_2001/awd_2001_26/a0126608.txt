Abstract    :
              The principle objective of this workshop is to bring together experts from both
              domestic advanced networks and HPIIS to develop metrics.  These metrics will be
              used to quantify the use of HPIIS network links, to classify research use of
              these advanced networks and to collect success stories for each classification.
               A future objective will be the reporting of the numbers of published papers
              and people trained over time.
