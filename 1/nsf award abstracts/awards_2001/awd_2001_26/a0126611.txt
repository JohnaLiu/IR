Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

This project enhances the knowledge and skills of
              students in developmental mathematics courses by providing on demand access to
              mathematics instructions. The project also contributes to the research
              literature on the use of computer-assisted instruction in developmental
              mathematics. The web-based courseware Assessment and Learning in Knowledge
              Spaces (ALEKS) is adapted and implemented. The project includes a 36-station
              computer lab for the use of ALEKS and video clips to go along with the lab. Web
              cameras that are used for remote student-faculty interaction are also included.
              This integration of technology in mathematics education is accompanied by
              extensive faculty development.
