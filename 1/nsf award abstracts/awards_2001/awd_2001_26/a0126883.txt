Abstract    :
              Biology (61)
The Biology Department at the University of St. Thomas has built a
              curriculum for both majors and non-majors that introduces undergraduates to
              modern biological techniques modeled on actual scientific investigations. This
              project is introducing flow cytometry into this curriculum in order to address
              our goal of providing students with hands-on exposure to current technology via
              investigative laboratory experiences. The project is modeled after successful
              similar efforts at Occidental College, Haverford College, Ursinus College, and
              San Diego State University. The flow cytometer is a powerful tool for detailed
              analysis of complex populations of cells in a short period of time. In recent
              years, flow cytometers have become less expensive and more user-friendly,
              making them accessible and appropriate for undergraduate biology
education. In
              this project we are integrating flow cytometry into our curriculum via three
              majors courses, two non-majors courses, and independent student research. We
              also making flow cytometry available to Biology faculty in a Twin Cities
              consortium of five private institutions. We are aiming to expand future use of
              the technology into other courses of our curriculum such as advanced cell
              biology, microbiology, molecular biology, evolution and ecology, as seen in
              other undergraduate programs.
