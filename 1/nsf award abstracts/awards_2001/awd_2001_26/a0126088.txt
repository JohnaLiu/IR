This is a study of middle school science assessment test
              items.  It intends to develop test items that have high levels of validity. 
              The investigators would create a framework to guide writing valid science items
              that elicit intended knowledge, skills, and cognitive processes that are valid
              for women, men, and minority groups.  The goal is to develop a strategy that
              can be used by other test developers to develop such tests rather than develop
              the test itself.  They are seeking items that require the students to use the
              same knowledge and skills as intended by test developers and that work the same
              way regardless of ethnicity or gender.  The framework also involves attention
              to student motivation, content exposure, and attitude toward response
              strategies and uses a taxonomy developed by Richard Snow as the basis for their
              study.  The product will be a series of reports that will serve as a guide for
              middle school science assessment developers.
