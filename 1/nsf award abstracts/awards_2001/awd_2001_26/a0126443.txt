Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
This project outlines the needs, equipment and
              implementation plans to integrate digital imaging technology into the Cell and
              Molecular Biology (CMB) curriculum at SMSU. This technology is currently used
              in biomedical and biotechnology fields. Adapting this technology to teaching
              laboratories is expected to enhance student learning and job opportunities
              available to SMSU students. This instrumentation is to be retrofitted on an
              existing shared microscope, an Olympus BX60, used for undergraduate courses and
              research. The technology enhancement of this microscope 1) provides for
              collection and analysis of data in laboratory courses and student research to
              allow use of learned computer skills to develop knowledge in the scientific
              process of data analysis; and 2) provides for faculty opportunities to become
              current with skills in digital imaging technology to allow for integration into
              the undergraduate laboratory curriculum and research projects. This experience
              benefits all CMB majors, those interested in basic science and in allied
              medical careers, by providing the opportunity to obtain the skills and
              knowledge base in digital imaging techniques required to be competitive for
              jobs and positions within the growing biomedical field. This request for
              instrumentation updates and enhances the capabilities of existing equipment in
              use within the program, and enhances the career opportunities for the mostly
              rural and female students in the CMB program at SMSU.
