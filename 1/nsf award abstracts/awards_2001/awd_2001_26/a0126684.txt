Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59)

The project is adapting course and curriculum
              modification from several engineering schools at Lake Superior State
              University. It involves the development of a new integrated Energy Conversion
              Laboratory that will support instruction in electro-mechanical conversion
              systems, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and modern industrial control. The
              laboratory is supporting seven courses in the EE and ME programs. Undergraduate
              students and senior design teams are working to integrate and implement the new
              laboratory. Project evaluation involves an assessment model that includes
              measurable educational objectives and department level review of each course.
              The investigators plan to disseminate results of the evaluation process along
              with detailed descriptions of the new trainers/interfaces and the data
              acquisition equipment by postings on the University's web site and
              presentations at engineering education conferences.
