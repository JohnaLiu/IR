Abstract    :
              The goal of this EPSCoR Centers Development Initiative (CDI) project is to
              increase the participation and competitiveness of EPSCoR researchers in
              multi-investigator Centers grant programs funded by the National Science
              Foundation.  This project will provide direct consultation and assistance to
              the EPSCoR community using the following two complementary strategies:
Centers
              Initiation: enhance proposals being developed by EPSCoR
              institutions/jurisdictions for submission to major NSF Center
              programs.
Centers Infusion: match research groups in EPSCoR
              institutions/jurisdictions with NSF funded Centers and link and support
              partnerships with funded NSF Centers.

This project builds on the success of
              a previous pilot project that provided direct consultation and assistance to
              researchers with promising EPSCoR Initiation Centers projects.  This project
              expands the successful Initiation approach and adds the second approach of
              Centers Infusion to increase collaboration between EPSCoR jurisdictions and
              Centers in EPSCoR and non-EPSCoR jurisdictions.  The Centers Initiation and
              Infusion strategies stimulate competitive, collaborative large-scale research
              through the following activities: opportunities identification, consultation
              and assistance, outreach, partnerships, project development and dissemination. 
              This project is a joint undertaking of the University of South Dakota, the
              EPSCoR Foundation and the EPSCoR
