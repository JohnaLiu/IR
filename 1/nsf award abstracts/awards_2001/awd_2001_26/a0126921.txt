Abstract    :
              The objectives of this project are (1) to integrate selected biochemical
              concepts and methods and (2) to introduce project-oriented, student-designed
              laboratories into the analytical course. An HPLC system and a UV-Visible
              spectrophotometer are making this possible. Specific experiments and the
              project laboratory approach are being adapted from the chemical education
              literature, the primary chemistry literature, and application notes provided by
              manufacturers. The proposed changes are correlated with a Departmental goal to
              integrate biochemical concepts across the chemistry curriculum and toward a
              college-wide effort for student-directed, individualized learning
              opportunities. By incorporating biochemical concepts and group project
              experiments into the analytical laboratory, student understanding of selected
              biochemical topics, student ability to apply an analytical approach to
              biochemical problems, and student capacity for working with other members of a
              group toward the solution of a problem are being increased.
