Abstract    :
              Engineering - Materials Science (57)
We have developed a textbook and
              accompanying CD-ROM for a course in materials specifically designed for
              non-science majors. This work builds on the success of a course developed at
              Washington State University for non-science majors that addresses the manner in
              which materials impact society on a regional, national, and global scale. The
              course "Materials: The Foundations of Society and Technology" is targeted at
              third and fourth year undergraduates and is a "capstone" course in our General
              Education Curriculum. This textbook is based on the extensive notes we have
              prepared in developing the course and on research we have undertake under the
              auspices of this proposal. The textbook has been written in such a way that it
              can readily be used by the general college population. To assist faculty that
              decide to teach similar courses at their own institution we have developed a
              CD-ROM. Our CDROM has links to important educational and informational
              resources. In addition it contains homework problems and suggested assignments
              as well as background information regarding basic engineering and scientific
              principles.
