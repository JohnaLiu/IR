Abstract    :
              Abstract  A Workshop on Williams Syndrome and the Issue of Neurogenetic
              Developmental Disorders  Ilona Kovacs & Csaba Pleh  	Williams syndrome is a
              rare developmental disorder that has captured the attention of developmental
              cognitive scientists because it has been implicated in several double
              dissociation mechanisms.  The peculiar developmental profiles and uneven
              distribution of results are of interest because they enable scientists to study
              the "separability" of various cognitive functions.  The syndrome is interpreted
              as having impaired vision and less impaired language; impaired visual
              integration and less impaired analytic processing; better grammar than lexicon;
              and, high social competence. The workshop will be based on intense experimental
              and theoretical cooperation between several internationally recognized
              researchers in the field. The workshop will focus on:  developmental models
              used in explaining Williams syndrome abilities; exact profiles of visual
              impairment of Williams syndrome subjects of all ages; working memory and
              language acquisition in Williams syndrome; language profiles of Williams
              syndrome subjects obtained from populations speaking different languages;
              comparisons with other populations, most notably with autistic subjects; and
              issues of self-help in families of Williams syndrome children.
