Abstract    :
              Computing - Other (35) These workshops provide models for teaching
              undergraduate genomics - the emerging field of computational analysis of DNA
              sequences. The key feature is the creation of collaborations between biologist
              and computer scientists who link their courses in order to include coordinated
              material. The use of workshops over a two-year time span allows for
              development, feedback and dissemination of models and educational materials.
