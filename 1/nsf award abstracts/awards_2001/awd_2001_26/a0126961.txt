Abstract    :
              An Anasazi Instruments FT-NMR conversion package for the current EM-390 NMR has
              been purchased and is providing enhanced learning opportunities for students.
              In Organic Chemistry, students are able to quickly and effectively characterize
              reaction products by H-1, C-13, and two-dimensional methods. A change in the
              fundamental pedagogy of this course is also being instituted based upon the
              adaptation and implementation of a similar program developed at Albion College.
              Research problems selected by the faculty are segmented into smaller research
              questions that are being addressed by student teams during three-to-seven week
              projects. Students are learning to design and carry out their own experiments
              in response to a research problem, are learning to evaluate resultant data and
              to draw their own conclusions. Upon completion of the research projects, oral
              presentations by each research team are critiqued by other members of the
              class. The FT NMR is also being used in other courses in the curriculum with
              experiments from both the research and educational literature being adapted and
              implemented.
