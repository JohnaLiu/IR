Abstract    :
              This project is developing and implementing a Biotechnology Program at the
              University of Nevada, Reno. We are adapting courses and objectives from
              successful Biotechnology Programs at Ferris State University and Northwestern
              University. The program is a collaborative effort by the College of Arts and
              Sciences and the College of Agriculture, Biotechnology and Natural Resources,
              and extends from the University to two local community colleges, local middle
              and high schools, and the community at large. The specific goals of the
              biotechnology program are: 1) to meet the growing student interest in a
              biotechnology career-directed education via development of an intercollegiate
              biotechnology degree program, 2) to increase the scientific literacy of a wide
              diversity of undergraduate students through the addition of biotechnology into
              courses for science and non-science majors, 3) to enhance community interest
              and knowledge in the sciences by community outreach, and 4) to enhance economic
              development in the state by the creation of a well-trained work force of
              biotechnology scientists.
