This award supports work on trapped gases in Antarctic and
              other ice cores for paleoenvironmental and chronological purposes.  The project
              will complete a ~ 100,000 year, high-resolution record of atmospheric methane
              from the Siple Dome ice core and use these data to construct a precise
              chronology for climate events recorded by the Siple Dome record.  In addition,
              the resolution of the GISP2 (Greenland) ice core record will be increased in
              some critical intervals to help with the Siple Dome chronology and that of
              future ice cores.  Finally, an upgrade to the analytical capabilities of the
              laboratory, including increasing precision and throughput and decreasing sample
              size needed for ice core methane measurements will be an important goal of this
              work.  The proposed work will contribute to the understanding of the timing of
              rapid climate change in the Northern and Southern hemispheres during the last
              glacial period, the evolution of the global methane budget in the late
              Quaternary, and the late Quaternary climate history of Antarctica.  It will
              also improve our ability to generate methane records for future ice coring
              projects, and inform and enrich the educational and outreach activities of our
              laboratory.
