Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21) This proof-of-concept (POC) project is developing and
              evaluating a set of curriculum modules in knot theory for use in courses that
              typically comprise a pre-service teacher program. The PIs aim to graduate
              teachers who "learn mathematics in a coherent fashion that emphasizes the
              interconnections among theory, procedures and applications," and who "develop
              the habits of mind of a mathematical thinker" (CBMS, 2000). Since knot theory
              draws on connections with diverse types of mathematics, it has the potential to
              integrate well into courses on geometry, topology, combinatorics, discrete
              mathematics, or graph theory. Java applications are being developed to
              illustrate the Jones polynomial in a dynamic and visual context. Additionally,
              the project team is conducting research that addresses the mathematical
              knowledge and the beliefs about mathematics of preservice and practicing
              secondary mathematics teachers.
