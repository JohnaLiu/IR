Cogenetic biotite and sanidine from volcanic rocks often yield
              discordant 40Ar/39Ar ages. The typical age discordance is between 0.2 and 1.0
              Ma. The discordance has important implications for detailed, high precision
              volcanic history studies, for intercalibration of K/Ar with U/Pb and other
              geochronological methods, and the age of flux monitor standards.  This proposal
              will investigate the causes of the biotite/sanidine discordance through
              detailed geochronological analyses of two well-studied Mid-Tertiary volcanic
              sequences from the Mogollon-Datil volcanic field of New Mexico. The expected
              outcome of this study could be far reaching, if it is shown that biotite ages
              are plagued by inaccuracy that is not evident in individual analyses.  Because
              biotite is the most commonly dated volcanic and plutonic mineral phase and it
              often yields highly precise apparent ages, determination of accuracy of biotite
              ages is essential to a wide variety of tectonic, volcanic, and geological
              studies.
