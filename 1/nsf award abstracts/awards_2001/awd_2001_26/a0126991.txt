Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)
This project pioneers an innovative methodology that
              increases the effectiveness of formal methods courses by providing students
              with sophisticated tools for understanding and proving program correctness.
              These tools are based upon Z, the common and powerful specification language
              and include type checking, specification animation and proof obligations. A
              separate tool is used for code generation. All of the tools provide research
              quality support to students learning to program in a formally correct
              manner.

Student performance is evaluated via tracking experimental and
              control groups through the core curriculum; the control group enrolls in
              similar courses but does not use the tools. We will measure and report two
              important factors: task completion time and error count.
