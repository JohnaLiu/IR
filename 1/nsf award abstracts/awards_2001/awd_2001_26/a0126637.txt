Abstract    :
              This award is establishing a digital imaging and data analysis center of
              networked computers and image acquisition equipment for use at all levels
              across the science curriculum. The facility is modeled after a successful
              digital imaging laboratory in the Department of Biology at Franklin and
              Marshall College (DUE 9750430) and is adapted for our interconnected science
              departments. The award is (1) engaging students in an active manner in the
              process of scientific inquiry through digital imaging, (2) promoting
              collaborative research between students through instant data exchange and
              projection, and (3) demonstrating the inter-relatedness of scientific
              disciplines by linking courses that share imaging as an experimental approach.
              In order to achieve these aims, faculty who represent all science departments
              and in whose courses greater than 60% of all students in the College are
              enrolled are utilizing the facility each year. Several of the courses are
              incorporating cross-disciplinary laboratory exercises. This project is
              impacting in a positive fashion student performance in science, student
              perceptions of science, and recruitment of students into science majors.
              Results of this project will be widely disseminated through workshops, poster
              presentations, publications, and websites.
