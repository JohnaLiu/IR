Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

With the acquisition of an Agilent UV/VIS spectrophotometer
              equipped with LabVIEW software, we are introducing chemical kinetics and
              computer data analysis in our introductory chemistry course and in
              environmental management technology program. Most of our students in this
              associate degree program enter the workforce upon graduation and become
              involved in environmental testing and chemical analyses in a laboratory
              setting. Our goal is to better prepare students to meet these challenges by
              adapting and implementing computer-aided laboratory experiments into our
              curriculum. These experiments allow students to integrate and reinforce
              chemical concepts learned in the classroom with real-life experiences. Kinetics
              is a difficult concept for students to grasp and often requires exploring the
              topic through various modalities. We are using our UV/VIS to do kinetics
              experiments in which the students visually track changes in chemical reactions
              in real time.
