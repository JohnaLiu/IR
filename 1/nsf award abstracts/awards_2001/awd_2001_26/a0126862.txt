Abstract    :
              Atomic absorption spectroscopy is an important method of elemental analysis that
              undergraduate chemistry students should encounter at all levels of the
              curriculum. We are adapting proven atomic absorption experiments that use both
              flame and graphite atomization procedures and implementing them into the
              laboratories for Introductory Chemistry, Environmental Chemistry, and
              Instrumental and Experimental Chemistry. These experiments are taken from the
              recent educational literature, have an environmental, real-world content and
              thus are relevant to the experiences of our students, both majors and
              non-majors alike. The instrument is also being used by undergraduates as part
              of a variety of research projects. New laboratory manuals are being written to
              reflect the increased emphasis on atomic absorption spectroscopy and the
              manuals can be disseminated to other institutions wishing to incorporate atomic
              absorption spectroscopy into their curriculum. The experiments and the success
              of our students in mastering atomic absorption will be disseminated to the
              chemical education community through presentations at local and national
              meetings, publication in chemical education journals, and personal contacts.
