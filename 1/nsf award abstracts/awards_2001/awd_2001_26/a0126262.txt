Abstract    :
              This proposed work is the continued operation of the Antarctic Meteorological
              Research Center (AMRC) for three years.  AMRC is a meteorological data
              acquisition and management system with nodes at McMurdo Station and at the
              University of Wisconsin, Madison.  The system is a resource and archive for
              meteorological research and a test bed for improving operational synoptic
              forecasting.  Its basis is a computer-based system for organizing,
              manipulating, and integrating antarctic environmental data, developed by the
              University of Wisconsin.  It captures the flow of meteorological information
              from polar orbiting satellites, automatic weather stations, operational station
              synoptic observations, and research project data, producing a mosaic of
              antarctic satellite images on an operational basis.  It also receives
              environmental data products, such as weather forecasts, from outside
              Antarctica, and acts as a repository for existing archived databases.  The AMRC
              provides customized weather and climate information for a variety of antarctic
              users, including aircraft and ship operations of the US Antarctic Program. 
              Currently the AMRC produces the Antarctic Composite Infrared Image, a mosaic of
              images from four geostationary and three polar-orbiting satellites, which is
              used for both forecasting and research purposes.
