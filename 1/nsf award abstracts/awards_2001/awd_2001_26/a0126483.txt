Abstract    :
              	This project is a balloon-borne experiment whose main goals include 1) a
              focused program of investigation of high latitude ionospheric electrodynamics
              (the study of the properties of electromagnetic radiation and the way in which
              it interacts with charged matter) using multiple long duration balloons
              launched in Antarctica, and 2) the investigation of the fast penetration of
              electric fields from the outer to the inner magnetosphere in response to
              external inputs.  The project is cooperative with Japanese X-ray and
              magnetometer investigators.  The bulk of the proposed effort will be focused on
              investigation of outstanding problems of the polar and auroral ionosphere such
              as the nature of polar cap convection under varying solar wind conditions,
              dynamics of the dayside cusp, the transient and steady state coupling of the
              solar wind to the magnetosphere, transient phenomena on wholly closed magnetic
              fields lines such as traveling convective vortices (TCVs) and those related to
              magnetic pulsations with periods greater than one second.  Another important
              effort will be to investigate the rapid transmission of ionospheric and
              magnetospheric electric fields from higher to lower latitudes in response to
              variations in the interplanetary magnetic field.
	This project consists of the
              construction, integration and testing of the electric field instruments for the
              geophysics payloads that are planned as part of the 2002-2003 continuation of
              the Polar Patrol Balloon Program managed by the Japanese National Institute of
              Polar Research Three balloons will be flown from the Japanese Antarctic
              Station, while one payload will be launched from McMurdo Station.
