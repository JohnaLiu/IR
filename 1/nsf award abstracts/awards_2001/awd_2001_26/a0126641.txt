Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
Integrating technology and research rich laboratory
              experiences into biology curricula clearly fosters creativity and significantly
              improves learning. At Wittenberg University we strive to provide hands-on
              learning opportunities for our undergraduate students that are inquiry based
              and integrate modern scientific equipment. To accomplish this goal in an
              immunology course a "research-based mixed-model" approach is being adapted from
              the University of St. Thomas, Rider University, Haverford College and St.
              Mary's University. The mixed-model approach provides students with 10 weeks of
              instructor led exercises followed by a 4 week long directed research project.
              This project is providing students with a high quality investigative laboratory
              experience as a means of enhancing learning in immunology. The acquisition of
              scientific laboratory equipment and training faculty in both equipment use and
              integration of a research-based pedagogy into their courses is accomplishing
              the objectives of the project. Moreover, the Department of Biology strongly
              promotes undergraduate research and believes that student-centered
              investigative laboratory experiences fosters the creativity that leads to
              increased student involvement in independent research. This adaptation and
              implementation proposal targets the DUE themes of integration of technology in
              education and faculty development.
