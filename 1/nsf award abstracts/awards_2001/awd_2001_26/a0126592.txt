A Workshop on An Interdisciplinary Exploration of Social
              Cooperation

Joann Keyton

The goal of the proposed workshop grant is to
              develop and execute a small workshop that promotes interdisciplinary research
              that identifies the factors that contribute to, or compromise, children's
              ability to work cooperatively in groups critical skill for children's academic
              and social development. To that end, the proposed workshop will: (a) bring
              together scholars in three disciplines--Communication, Education, and
              Psychology that can contribute to our understanding of social cooperation; (b)
              invite a senior scholar in each of these disciplines to keynote at the
              workshop; (c) invite regional scholars (generally, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia,
              Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee) to participate in working sessions
              of the workshop to help explore this research focus, develop research agendas,
              and discover potential interdisciplinary research partners; and (d) invite
              community leaders and experts who work with children and adolescents to provide
              a practical framework from which research is generated and for which basic
              research can provide meaningful answers.
Thus, the workshop is designed to
              promote exchange of current knowledge about children's social cooperativeness
              in each of the contexts in which children find themselves as group members
              (families, peer groups, organized activities, and school settings), and to
              promote exchange of knowledge across disciplines. More specifically, the host
              scholars want to use the workshop and its activities as a vehicle for
              articulating a vision for developing an interdisciplinary research center that
              would promote collaborative work among researchers from universities, school
              districts, and community agencies throughout the Mid-South region.
