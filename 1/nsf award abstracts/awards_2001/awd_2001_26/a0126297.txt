Knowledge of the subsurface residence time of groundwater
              has a multitude of important
applications, both scientific and utilitarian. 
              The determination  of groundwater residence time is fraught with complexity
              because of uncertainties in aquifer properties, initial conditions, and
              hydrodynamic history, as well as possible subsurface production or water-rock
              interactions involving the isotopic or chemical tracers used for residence time
              determination.  Although there are a number of well-developed tools for dating
              relatively young groundwaters, there is a paucity of tools for dating
              relatively old groundwaters.  The most commonly used tool for dating old
              groundwater is accelerator-based mass spectrometry of   36Cl, yet this approach
              is compromised by the temporal and geographic variability of the initial  
              36Cl/Cl ratio as well as the locally variable magnitude of subsurface 36CI
              production.  A more ideal tool than  36Cl,, yet one which has been neglected
              because of analytical difficulties, is   81Kr Resent developments in
              magnetooptical atom-trapping methods have made accurate, precise 81Kr analysis
              possible by using a benchtop-scale apparatus.  We propose to use the prototype
              instrument for atom-trap trace analysis (developed at Argonne National
              Laboratory by Z. T. Lu and colleagues) to perform the first 81Kr measurements
              of very old groundwater from the Nubian Aquifer of the Westem Desert of Egypt. 
              The Kr will be extracted and purified from samples of 8,000-10,000 liters each
              by B. Lehmann and colleagues of the University of Bem who have developed
              large-sample noble gas extraction methods for 239Ar analysis of ground waters. 
              These 81Kr data will be obtained in conjunction with a suite of other chemical
              and isotopic data (including solute ion and dissolved gas analyses; stable
              isotopes of H, C, N, 0, S, and Cl; and tritium, radiocarbon, and radiochlorine)
              and used to address fundamental questions about groundwater dating and the
              history of the Nubian aquifer.
