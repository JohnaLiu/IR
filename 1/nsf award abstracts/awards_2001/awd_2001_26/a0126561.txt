An exciting discovery of geomagnetic field
              behavior was made in Jurassic oceanic basalts of the Pacific Ocean. Continuous
              change of geomagnetic polarity was observed in a four hundred meter basalt
              sequence. Six polarity "intervals" were observed, corresponding to geomagnetic
              field reversals roughly once every 50,000 years. Such fast, continuously
              reversing behavior has never before been observed. The ~170 Ma oceanic crust is
              remarkably unaltered (similar to 0-20 Ma age oceanic basalt). Magnetic
              intensities of the basalt are normal to slightly high for unaltered oceanic
              crust, and microprobe work shows that this is not the result of an unusual
              chemistry of the titanomagnetite remanence carriers. An abundance of glass,
              which commonly preserves pristine titanomagnetite is present throughout the 400
              m. The glass abundance provides the opportunity to examine geomagnetic field
              intensity during this unusual field behavior. In the record of constantly
              changing polarity, numerous intervals of intermediate directions also are
              present, including intervals of zero inclination at which geomagnetic field
              intensity would be expected to be lowest. The glass abundance in a record of
              continuously changing field behavior and the intermediate and zero-inclination
              directions allow interrogation of the intensity of the geomagnetic field during
              this unusual directional behavior. Paleointensities will be measured for each
              "polarity" state and for all intermediate-direction intervals for which glass
              is present. The result is expected to provide information about the geomagnetic
              field's ability to change on such a fast time scale. The results should provide
              data to help constrain geomagnetic dynamo theory.
