Abstract    :
              Project Summary
This proof of concept project develops a set of instructional
              materials for teaching fundamental programming concepts using an exciting
              simulation and visualization package. This package provides an environment that
              supports the creation of 3-dimensional, interactive, animated virtual worlds
              (which can be easily built by novices!). It is expected that this approach will
              strengthen and enhance student skills as well as provide sufficient programming
              experience to improve student performance and retention in introductory
              computer science (CS 1) and beyond.

The results of this project will be the
              creation of a set of instructional materials: textbook, laboratory exercises,
              lecture and demonstration slides, and a reference for the animation software,
              and the collection and analysis of preliminary data on the use of these
              materials. All curricular materials will be freely available and disseminated
              online.
