Abstract    :
              Engineering - Civil (54)

The project implements a sophisticated research
              technique, Planar Laser-Induced Florescence (PLIF), into a safe, versatile, and
              robust instructional tool at the University of Colorado. It adapts research and
              instructional implementations at Stanford University. The PLIF system is being
              incorporated into a dedicated teaching flume that students are using to
              visualize fluid flow and the effect of various interactions on the flow
              pattern. Five faculty members are incorporating the facility into their
              courses. Assessment tools include student surveys, open-ended interviews,
              written test, and course evaluations. The group is preparing a web site, a
              workshop, and engineering education publications describing the construction
              and implementation details along with assessment results.
