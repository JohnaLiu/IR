The occurrence of deep-focus earthquakes remains
              one of the great mysteries of geophysics because laboratory experiments
              demonstrate that materials become ductile at the pressures of the Earth's deep
              interior.  How then can rock undergo brittle rupture at the pressures of the
              deepest earthquakes, some 0.25 million atmospheres?  The proposal requests
              support for a 3-year effort intended to develop and then begin applying a new
              experimental method for characterizing acoustic emissions generated from
              samples at high pressures.  An array of GHz-frequency sensors is to be attached
              to a diamond-anvil cell in order to characterize the elastic-energy released by
              high-pressure phase transitions in mantle minerals and their analogs. The work
              combines proven technologies (acoustic-emission recording and GHz ultrasonics
              with the diamond cell), and shows considerable promise for future development
              of a large variety of complementary methods (optical, spectroscopic,
              diffraction) for characterizing brittle failure in detail and under a wide
              range of conditions.
