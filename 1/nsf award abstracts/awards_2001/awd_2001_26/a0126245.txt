Abstract    :
              Physics (13) With its capability of visualization and manipulation at atomic and
              molecular
levels, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has become one of the most
              important
advancements in science and technology in the past decade. This
              project is adapting and integrating
SPM into a two-semester Electron
              Microscopy (EM) course that has been taught at the
University of
              Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC). The addition of SPM instrumentation to
the course
              gives students a broader view and experience on the cutting edge
microscopy
              technologies. The integration also allows a more efficient approach
              in
teaching the subject, because the course covers a wider range of techniques
              used in
microscopy and emphasizes the application of these techniques in
              various fields. The
improvement of the course is being achieved by
              introducing, in addition to the existing
hands-on experiments on EM, two
              verification-type experiments using SPM to visualize
atomic structures on
              well-defined crystalline surfaces in the first semester. This is
followed, in
              the second semester, by three inquiry-based experiments that involve both
SPM
              and EM. The improved course enhances the interdisciplinary education
in
              science, mathematics, engineering and technology at UMKC.
