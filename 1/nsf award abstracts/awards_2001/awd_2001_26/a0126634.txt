Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
The Biology Department of West Chester University
              (WCU) has a rare opportunity to redesign both the physical space and the
              curriculum for our three introductory biology laboratories, General Biology
              (Bio 110), Botany (Bio 215) and Zoology (Bio 217). By adapting materials from
              Northern Arizona University and Hampshire College, the emphasis in the
              laboratory moves from activities that primarily serve to reinforce lecture
              material to student-driven research investigations that stimulate critical
              thinking and an appreciation of the scientific method. To enhance and
              coordinate our introductory biology curriculum, we are: 1) developing new
              laboratories that include open-ended components, 2) increasing the use of
              technologies that enhance the learning experience, 3) linking concepts and
              creating spiraling connections between the sub-disciplines, 4) encouraging
              collaboration among students and faculty through the use of pedagogy designed
              to foster cooperation, and 5) providing a research-rich learning environment as
              a training ground for our future secondary school teachers. Students in our
              Secondary Education Program (BS Biology, Education) are actively involved with
              the development and implementation of the inquiry-based laboratories. With the
              help of Dr. Lesley Welsh, an assessment expert from the School of Education at
              WCU, we are evaluating the effectiveness of these changes.
