This award supports the continuation of the Science
              Management Office (SMO) for the National Ice Core Laboratory (NICL).  The
              NICL-SMO is located at the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans and Space
              at the  University of New Hampshire and serves as the primary point of contact
              for scientists interested in access to ice cores.  It also facilitates the
              interactions of the Ice Core Working Group (ICWG), a group of scientists
              knowledgable about ice cores who provide guidance to funding agencies on topics
              related to sample access, distribution, inventory, policy issues, operation and
              maintenance of the NICL facility and future directions for ice core research. 
              NICL-SMO assists  the ICWG in polling the scientific community and in
              developing reports, planning workshops and coordinating educational outreach
              activities.  Increasing public and scientific interest in ice cores and ice
              core records and the growing demand for information about current and past
              climate all point to the immense importance of this field and the need for this
              function.  Under this renewal award the NICL-SMO will start to publish a
              bi-yearly  newsletter to inform the science community and the general public
              about the latest findings from ice cores and other news of interest to people
              curious about ice cores and the paleoclimate records they provide.
