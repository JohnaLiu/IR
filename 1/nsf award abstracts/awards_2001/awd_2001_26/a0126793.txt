Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59)

This project is developing, evaluating, and
              disseminating web-based modules for courses on numerical methods and for
              upper-level engineering courses using numerical methods. The two prototype
              modules concern nonlinear equations and interpolation. The modules allow
              user-customization of content based on engineering major and mathematical
              package used. The effort provides the basis for a full development proposal
              focusing on eight mathematical procedures taught in typical undergraduate
              numerical analysis courses. The project includes an evaluation study to compare
              the performance of students who have and have not used the modules on specially
              designed tests. Dissemination efforts include posting material on the course
              web page and on web site hubs for mathematical packages and sharing the results
              at engineering education conferences and in engineering education journals.
