Abstract    :
              	This project studies stochastic processes that model complex, interacting
              behavior, such as interacting particle systems and interface models. Basic
              examples of particle systems studied are exclusion-type processes and
              Hammersley's process. Special situations studied in this project include
              bottlenecks, traffic jams, boundaries between different phases, priorities
              between individuals, and other irregularities that disturb the individual
              particles. An interface model describes the growth or decay of one phase
              relative to another. Examples of mathematical models in this category are
              last-passage models, models of increasing sequences, and marching soldiers
              models. The questions addressed are the speed, the eventual shape, and the
              roughness of the interface. The results of this project will concern the
              macroscopic behavior of these models and the fluctuations and deviations around
              the expected behavior.  	A basic feature of the world around us is that
              natural processes occur at several different scales. Large scale features are
              formed through the combined effect of a vast number of operators on a smaller
              scale. This can be observed in physical processes, biological processes, and
              man-made processes. For example, the disorganized motions and collisions of
              individual fluid particles make up the flow of a river; competition and
              cooperation at the level of individuals determines the evolution of a
              population; and the behavior of vehicles on a freeway determines the flow of
              traffic. Many different complex systems share common basic principles of
              organization and behavior. Such shared features can be abstracted in
              mathematical models, and analysis of these models then has implications for
              many particular applications. This project is about the mathematical study of
              such models, and the outcome of this project is a better understanding of the
              behavior of certain classes of models of complex systems.
