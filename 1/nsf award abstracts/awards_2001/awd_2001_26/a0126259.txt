Abstract    :
              This proposal will support a workshop of researchers in medical informatics,
              database systems,
health care issues, and clinical information systems to
              discuss the use of clinical records in medical and computer science research. 
              It will address issues in system interoperability, user needs,
              privacy,
security, economic issues, and most importantly national needs and
              opportunities with respect to the very rich medical information base in
              clinical records.
