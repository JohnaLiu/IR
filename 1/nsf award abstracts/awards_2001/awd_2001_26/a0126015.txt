Abstract    :
              The snowball Earth hypothesis proposes that during times of especially
              widespread glaciation some 600 to 750 million years ago, the surface ocean
              became completely covered with ice, resulting in the mass extinction of marine
              life.  The occurrence of such events has important implications for the Earth's
              climate system as well as for the evolution of complex multicellular organisms,
              which appear in the fossil record immediately after the last evidence of these
              severe ice ages.  The disruption of marine ecosystems called for in the
              snowball Earth hypothesis should be recorded in the carbon isotopic values of
              carbonate rocks deposited during the glacial event.  Appropriate successions
              are present in Namibia, Australia and the North American Cordillera, to test
              this prediction, and provide insight into life in a snowball ocean.  Initial
              results suggest life was not terribly different than before the snowball event,
              thus challenging the notion that sea ice was extensive enough to disrupt marine
              ecosystems.  The data collected in this study will also be used to test other
              hypotheses proposed for these ice ages including the recent suggestion that
              post glacial massive destabilization of methane clathrates was responsible for
              many of the peculiar features of this record.
