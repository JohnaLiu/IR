Abstract    :
              A collaborative research program will study adaptive and survival strategies of
              microorganisms in biofilms.  The collaborating team includes researchers at the
              University of Buffalo and at Malmo University (Sweden).  The program has three
              objectives:  as a clear test of the induction hypothesis with a well-studied
              system, to identify the general and acid-specific stress proteins induced in S.
              mutans H7 during the early stages of the acid tolerance response and to
              initiate studies on their function; to establish the relationships between the
              acid tolerance and starvation responses in S. mutans, as functions of the
              surface energies of the substrata to which they have attached as biofilms; and
              to expand the study of the induction of stress proteins to include the response
              of S. mutnas to dynamic shear stresses that characterize relevant microbial
              biofilm environments.
