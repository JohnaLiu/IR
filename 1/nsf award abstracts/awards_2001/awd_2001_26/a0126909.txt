Abstract    :
              Engineering - Chemical (53)
We were previously funded under an NSF-sponsored
              project, in that program we integrated design through the use of AspenPlus
              simulation software which was developed for use in lecture courses throughout
              the four-year chemical engineering curriculum. In this project, the integration
              of design is expanded to include open-ended design-oriented experiences in the
              chemical engineering laboratory. Under this project we have our students
              working in an open-ended, design-build-test experiment in packed column design
              for gas absorption. The experiment is now part of our required senior-year
              chemical engineering laboratory course. It is modeled after a typical
              industrial project in which students are required to make design choices
              between competing alternatives where economics must be considered. Students are
              using AspenPlus to model the absorption process and make choices between
              alternative columns and column packing configurations. Our students are
              building and testing their design in the laboratory and report their findings
              in a written or oral presentation. We are assessing the effectiveness of this
              project by using student interviews, surveys of senior students and graduates,
              employers as well as the program's industrial advisory board.
