Abstract    :
              Engineering-Chemical(53)
We have developed interactive hybrid curriculum
              materials for teaching chemical reaction engineering. Our materials consists of
              textbooks, a CDROM, as well as a web site on the Internet. A prototype of this
              hybrid has been evaluated over the past two years at the University of
              Michigan. Through the use of interactive computer modules (ICM) we are
              supporting students with different student learning styles. These learning
              styles are outlined in the Felder/Solomon Inventory and we have designed our
              materials to address these in a number of different ways. The simulations we
              have created are around various chemical reactions. These simulations model
              complex problems that allow students to alter key parameters and evaluate their
              results to complement homework assignments, classroom lectures, and student
              study groups. These problems have been designed to enhance student critical
              thinking and problem solving skills. Updated authoring software Quest 10 from
              Quest 2.0 will be utilized as well as FEMLAB to upgrade our existing modules.
              Our original materials have gained a wide audience in the Chemical Engineering
              community. We are disseminating our new material through two textbooks, our
              CDROM that is being distributed to every chemical engineering department
              through the CACHE Corporation, and the Internet.
