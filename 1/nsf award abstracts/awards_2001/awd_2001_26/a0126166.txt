Abstract    :
              Theoretical models of motion transfer from the ductile lower lithosphere and
              mantle upward through the brittle-ductile transition and the brittle upper
              crust are as yet inadequate to account for many phenomena, partly because of
              lack of access to intact crust sections that represent deformation results from
              the same overall tectonic environment.  This project utilizes the
              Caribbean-South America plate boundary, which has been the locus of oblique
              convergence for the past 50 million years to address this problem.  This system
              has brought a sequence of rocks to the surface that represent a continuous
              vertical section of the crust exposed from west to east along the contact
              between the two plates from Venezuela to Trinidad.  Structural and
              thermochronologic data will be collected and used to develop, refine and test
              models for the origin, response partitioning, and exhumation of this sequence. 
              Results have the potential to place significant constraints on rheological
              differences within the lithosphere, which is of fundamental importance in
              understanding tectonic systems and plate interactions.
