Abstract    :
              Engineering - Aeronautical/Astronautical (51)

The project adapts effective
              pedogogies for an aerospace structures laboratory previously developed at
              several universities. The laboratory consists of a material and structure
              testing machine and provides experimental experiences in at least four courses.
              It also allows senior capstone design teams to verify the structural
              performance of their unmanned aerial vehicles. The Mathematics, Engineering,
              Science Achievement (MESA) program at the PI's institution, which focuses on
              increasing the number of underrepresented populations in engineering and
              science through programs for grades 6-12, plans to use the laboratory in MESA
              classes and summer programs. The investigators plan to assess and evaluate the
              project results through a variety of measures in conjunction with the
              University's Center for Engineering Learning and Teaching. Results will be
              disseminated through out reach programs, over the Internet, and at conferences.
