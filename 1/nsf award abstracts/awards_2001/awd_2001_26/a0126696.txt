This award is providing a dedicated molecular modeling Linux
              Cluster for use across the chemistry curriculum, including the integration of
              molecular modeling modules in honors freshman chemistry, honors organic, and
              experimental physical chemistry. A new computer laboratory course,
              Computational Nanotechnology is providing undergraduate chemistry students and
              other science majors an exposure to modern research techniques and emerging
              scientific are as. Computational Nanotechnology is training a new generation of
              skilled workers in the multidisciplinary approaches necessary for continued
              progress in
nanotechnology and is providing significant laboratory research
              experience. In this course, students are designing, building, and testing
              molecular devices, materials, and nanostructures adapted from the research and
              educational literature, including organic and protein-based molecular motors,
              surface interaction and self-assembly, and molecular dynamics simulations.
