Abstract    :
              0126383 Shelton  This project includes organization of a workshop to be
              conducted by NSF with support from WTEC, Inc. for a preliminary assessment of
              U.S. and international activities in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).
              This topic has been identified as a focus of a potential NSF/ENG study. The
              purpose of the workshop, to be held in summer of 2001, is to gather facts and
              opinions from experts in the U.S. research community on how this area of
              research should be defined for the purposes of such a study and to provide an
              overview of U. S. and international R&D activities within this scope. The
              information presented in the workshop will be distilled into a report to NSF.
