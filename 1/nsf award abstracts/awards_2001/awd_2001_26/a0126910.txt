Abstract    :
              Engineering - Chemical (53)
We have developed web-based Unit Operations
              experiments in Chemical Engineering. To help in this effort we are adapting
              various elements from CCLI web based experiments from existing work started by
              other investigators. These include CCLI 0088788 which involved
              multidisciplinary instruction in environmental science done by Dr. Krehbiel and
              his team. We are also adapting the work of Dr. Asumadu's novel Remote Wiring
              and Measurement Laboratory (RwmLab) CCLI 0088361. This project demonstrates how
              students can wire up physical electrical and electronics circuits and perform
              real measurements through internet access. Finally we are also using some of
              Dr. Kamangar's project, CCLI 9950697, where students implement a suitable
              hardware/ software environment for multi-platform computer-based monitor and
              control of the environment. We have developed two Internet-based Chemical
              Engineering Unit Operations experiments. The first is a non-isothermal
              fixed-bed adsorption remote controlled experiment as well as a dialysis unit
              operations experiment. For Internet-based laboratories to be successful, they
              must be effective learning experiences. Our plan has been to study the
              effectiveness of these on-line experiments relative to a hands-on experience.
              Building on our work and that of other researchers we hope to encourage other
              faculty to use of the Internet to deliver laboratory experiences. Our model, if
              emulated, would allow faculty to develop high quality experiments in their area
              of expertise and share them with the engineering community. In addition to this
              significant pedagogical benefit, the use of Internet-based laboratories offers
              the potential to reduce laboratory costs while simultaneously increasing the
              number of laboratories available to students. 

The University of Toledo
              Chemical and Environmental Engineering Department and The University of
              Cincinnati Chemical Engineering Department are committed to maintaining the
              experiments along with existing Unit Operations experiments. Finally, upon
              successful completion of our project, we will pursue a larger effort to develop
              Internet-based laboratories with all of the Chemical Engineering Departments in
              the State of Ohio.
