Abstract    :
              The proposed study will investigate the potentially significant role of the
              Southern Ocean and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current System in the global ocean
              circulation.  The focus will be on those specific antarctic processes that can
              influence the World Ocean, including formation of major water masses in the
              vicinity of Antarctica, air-sea exchanges of heat, moisture and momentum, as
              well as eddy mixing in the Southern Ocean.  Key questions to be addressed
              are:
1. What is the dynamical role of the Antarctic Bottom Water?  
2. What
              is the role of the Antarctic Intermediate Water in the global circulation? 
3.
              Why is the global thermohaline circulation sensitive to the magnitude of
              southern hemisphere winds?
4. What is the sensitivity of the global
              thermohaline circulation to the magnitudes of southern hemisphere heat and
              moisture fluxes? 
5. What is the role of the eddy mixing in the Southern
              Ocean?
6. What is the role of the lateral fluxes of heat, moisture and
              momentum across the northern
boundary of the Southern Ocean?
These questions
              will be addressed with an ocean general circulation model coupled to a
              sophisticated sea-ice model in a series of numerical experiments combining a
              sufficient degree of realism with computational efficiency, in order to obtain
              meaningful results within a reasonable time frame.  The work significantly
              improve our understanding of the dynamics of the Southern Ocean, and will
              emphasize the importance of the Antarctic region and the need for future
              observational and modeling studies of the area.
