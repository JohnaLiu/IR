Oxygen isotopic compositions of primitive Solar System
              materials have proved to be very powerful tracers of chemical process involved
              in formation of objects as small as chondrules to as large as planets. Isotopic
              compositions serve to determine genetic associations of divers meteoritic
              groups, such as the SNC (martian) meteorites and the HED (howardite, eucrite,
              diogenite) groups. Low-temperature aqueous processes in carbonaceous chondrites
              have been studied in terms of reservoir origins, alteration conditions and
              water/rock ratios. All this has been possible even though we lacked consensus
              on the ultimate origin of the "anomalous" effects. A novel approach, combining
              photochemistry and the X-wind model of stellar accretions, has the possibility
              of providing a consistent picture of oxygen isotopic evolution, along with a
              novel interpretation of the chemical evolution of the inner Solar System. In
              addition, we plan to use oxygen isotopic compositions of organic molecules in
              carbonaceous meteorites to determine how much of the organic chemistry occurred
              within the parent asteroid, and how much occurred earlier, in the Solar Nebula
              or in interstellar space. These are fundamental questions for the origin of
              pre-biotic organic molecules.
