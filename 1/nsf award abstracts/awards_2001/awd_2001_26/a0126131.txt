The objective of this proposal is to design and
              calibrate a non-invasive, passive acoustic system for measuring
              spatially-integrated  bedload transport rates in a natural bedrock channel.  We
              pro-pose to measure the self-generated  noise of bedload clasts in transport. 
              Our experimental design consists of eight hydrophones and  eight geophone 
              deployed along a 100m reach, with data recorded to disk after passing through a
              sixteen-channel analog-to-digital conversion board on a laptop computer.   The
              phones will be epoxied onto bedrock, near the banks, and onto large boulders in
               the center of the stream.  The hydrophone array and the geophone array will be
              compared to determine which, if either, is preferable and to eliminate signals
              from fluid turbulence, cavitation, and bubble collapse.  Both broadband and
              narrowband amplitudes will be analyzed for predictive power of bedload
              transport.  The purpose of the streamwise array is to exploit the presence of
              downstream propagating waves of bedload transport and to determine an optimal
              sampling design.  The system will be calibrated using bedload transport rates
              observed at low flows by conventional techniques such as chickenwire traps and
              Helley-Smith samplers, and at high flows by multiple surveys of a delta where
              the stream empties into a standing body of water The delta surveys will be
              accomplished using a shallow-water echosounder.   Key hydraulic variables also
              will be measured in the study reach in order to relate these variables to
              measured bedload  fluxes.  The result will be a non-invasive method for
              measuring cross-sectionally-integrated bedload transport rates in bedrock
              reaches at very short time intervals.
