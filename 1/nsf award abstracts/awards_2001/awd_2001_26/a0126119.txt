Abstract    :
              This project is a study of the mechanisms controlling the air-sea flux of
              soluble gases - in  particular chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), carbon dioxide, and
              oxygen - in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Southern Ocean.  There
              are three objectives to the study: (1) a better understanding of the influence
              of mesoscale oceanic processes on tracer transport, and how to represent those
              processes in coarse resolution models; (2) the development of an innovative
              diagnostic approach to evaluating air-sea gas fluxes rooted in our
              understanding of the relationship between air-sea fluxes, ocean transports and
              biogeochemical transformations, and 
(3) testing this approach against
              explicit models of southern ocean biogeochemical cycles
and apply it to
              observations to yield independent estimates air-sea carbon and oxygen flux.
An
              existing global model will be used as a testbed.  This model currently
              represents key biogeochemical processes with idealized parameterizations,
              however these are sufficient for an initial test of the basic assumptions of
              this diagnostic approach.  The continued development of the global
              biogeochemical model will occur in parallel with this diagnostic work.  This
              approach has great potential practical utility in supplementing current methods
              of estimating air-sea gas fluxes in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.  It will
              provide an explicit description of the connections between physical and
              biogeochemical processes, and will significantly improve the prognostic
              capabilities of such models in general.
