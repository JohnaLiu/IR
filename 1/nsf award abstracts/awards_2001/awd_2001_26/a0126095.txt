Abstract    :
              This award, provided by the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program of the
              Office of Polar Programs, provides funds for the unification and upgrading of
              its Antarctic collection; its proper storage and curation; development of an
              electronic database; and network access. This award will support a collection
              manager for two years, installing modern, archival-quality steel cabinets, and
              rehousing, conserving, and barcoding the entire collection. These changes will
              vastly increase the availability and research potential of a significant and
              unique Antarctic collection, and they will help to preserve a rich cultural,
              historical, and scientific legacy. The Antarctic collection constitutes one of
              the best repositories of archival, geological and paleontological holdings in
              the nation. The archival collection was amassed over a fifty-year span and
              contains maps and rare books in addition to Antarctic research samples. The
              comprehensive igneous and metamorphic rock collection gathered from the
              orogenic belts of Queen Maud Range, Marie Byrd Land, and Ellsworth Land is
              important for understanding the paleotectonic evolution of the Transantarctic
              Mountains and West Antarctica. The paleontological collection includes
              exquisite plant fossils from the Allan Hills, which indicate a Gondwanian
              heritage for Antarctica. Several holotypes of Cretaceous vertebrates from
              Seymour Island, including Polarornis, the oldest known Antarctic bird, provide
              additional evidence for high latitude heterochroneity.
