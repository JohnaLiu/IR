Abstract    :
              This award represents continued partial support of the Board on Infrastructure
              and the Constructed Environment (BICE). The National Research Council, through
              its Division of Engineering and Physical Sciences, established the BICE in 1994
              to investigate questions of technology, science, and public policy applied to
              urban systems and services; above ground and underground construction; the
              relationship between the constructed and natural environments, and their
              interaction with human activities; the effects of natural hazards on
              constructed facilities; and related issues of planning, design, construction
              management, surety, and use of the built environment. The BICE brings together
              in an independent forum expertise from a wide range of scientific, engineering,
              and social science disciplines to address problems and issues of infrastructure
              and the build environment. The BICE provides a unique structure to respond to
              specific requests from government, or to act on its own initiative with public
              or private sector support. In pursuit of its goals, BICE plans to conduct
              on-going strategic planning for studies, workshops, symposia, and a variety of
              information dissemination activities. The BICE also develops integrated and
              coordinated activities with the Institute for Civil Infrastructure (ICIS),
              established by NSF at the Wagner Graduate School at New York University. During
              the coming year, BICE will also include themes focused on extreme events,
              complexity, and interdependencies in their activities.
