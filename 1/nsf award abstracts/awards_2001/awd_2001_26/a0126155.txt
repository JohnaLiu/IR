Abstract    :
              This proposal from Boston College seeks funding to continue the preparation of
              prototype inquiry task items for the TIMSS 2003 international assessment and to
              provide a website for teachers that documents students' approaches to
              responding to the prototype problems.  The second set of activities includes a
              Questionnaire Development Group that would consider the most useful types of
              contextual information for TIMSS to gather and identify the best vehicle(s) for
              gathering it.  Support for this project ensures that the 2003 international
              study can continue the planning and staff work necessary for the 2003 TIMMS
              administration.
