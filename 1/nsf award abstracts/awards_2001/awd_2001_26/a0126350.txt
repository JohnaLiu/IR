Abstract    :
              
This project would develop an assessment framework and performance assessment
              practices after an analysis of frameworks from many countries for the purpose
              of assessing Information Communication Technology (ICT) as it is used in
              elementary and secondary schools.  The project would identify issues of
              large-scale implementation of performance assessments in information technology
              and develop performance assessment scenarios and specifications.  Moreover, the
              project would develop performance assessment tasks and test them in 4 countries
              and develop administrative and training manuals.  The results of this project
              would be used in an international studies called the Second International
              Technology in Education Study (SITES) sponsored
