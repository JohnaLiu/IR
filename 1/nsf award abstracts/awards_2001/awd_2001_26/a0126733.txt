Abstract    :
              Engineering - Electrical (55)

This project implements an integrated
              laboratory experience in the signal and systems area in the electrical
              engineering curriculum. The development is based on prior work at Georgia Tech
              and uses the telecommunication instructional modeling system (TIMS) developed
              there. The project is developing a set of experiments that use the same
              laboratory platform in a four-course sequence. Evaluation includes both
              quantitative measurements and interviews with two groups of students: one that
              completed the new experiments and one that did not. The PI plans to disseminate
              their experiments and their assessment results using their web pages and
              publications in the education journals. The PI also intends to use the
              equipment in two on-campus programs for high school students with diverse
              backgrounds.
