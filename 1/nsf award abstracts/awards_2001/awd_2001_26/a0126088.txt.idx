Abstract    :
              The panel reviewers said that there was a strong consensus about the need to
              explore the issues addressed in this grant and that this proposed research
              would give valuable assistance to item writers, test developers, and
              researchers.    The panel supported the proposal, (one reviewer said that the
              need for the study was great) but did wish for more detailed explanation and
              justification of the measures of affect and content exposure for different item
              formats.  They were concerned that the study might have missed an opportunity
              to comment on item format as well as content areas.  For example, the
              information gathered does not indicate differences in cost of items.  The
              panel also had a number of concerns about the design of the study to provide
              adequate measures of the effects of race and gender.  The number of cases would
              be small and would not be able to provide statistically reliable measures.  The
              investigators were asked to reconsider their design, and they noted that recent
              studies that use cognitive laboratories as they had planned were successful in
              providing highly reliable estimates of differences with very small samples. 
              They also said that they would take the concerns of the panel into mind when
              they completed their final design and would be able to more precisely indicate
              information about the membership in groups.  Several reviewers noted that the
              proposal was well written and that the researchers were well qualified to
              conduct this study.  One said that the authors represented some of the best
              minds in the field of assessment.  And that this project would have a huge
              effect on the discipline.  One reviewer said that this project has the
              potential to reveal value of mixed models of research by using statistical
              analysis and laboratory observation.  One reviewer noted his concerns, based
              on his own theories of assessment, that the project did not emphasize enough
              how items should be situated in a broader framework.  His concerns would
              require slight modification of the proposal to gather information from the
              students about their perception of the nature of science.  The authors appear
              to me to have adequately addressed these issues by having detailed responses
              from the students through the "think aloud" responses to each of the test
              items.    The researchers have not been very clear about the definition of
              ethnicity for each of the groups in the study.  Their response to questions
              showed that they intended to be more precise in their conduct of the study
              itself.
