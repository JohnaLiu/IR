This award supports a two-year project to continue work
              developing the techniques to make carbon monoxide (CO) measurements in ice core
              samples.  Carbon monoxide is an important atmospheric chemical constituent as
              it is a primary sink for hydroxyl radical (OH) (and therefore influences the
              oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere) and because the concentrations of three
              major greenhouses gases , carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and ozone (O3)
              are directly tied to the concentration of CO.  In light of recent anthropogenic
              increases in the emissions of CO, CO2, CH4 and NOx, it is desirable to
              understand this complex chemical system and the changes in the greenhouse
              forcing resulting from perturbation.  Because it is difficult to test the
              accuracy of models for past and future conditions for which no direct
              atmospheric measurements of trace gas concentrations are available these
              measurements must be obtained in other ways.  Polar ice cores provide a means
              to make these measurements.  Further work is necessary to refine the analytical
              technique and additional measurements are necessary to investigate the accuracy
              of these results and to establish the nature of temporal trends in CO.  It is
              anticipated that the CO record, combined with existing or new data for CO2, CH4
              , N2O and other paleoclimate variables, will provide further constraints on
              model studies of the effect of changing atmospheric chemistry on greenhouse
              forcing.
