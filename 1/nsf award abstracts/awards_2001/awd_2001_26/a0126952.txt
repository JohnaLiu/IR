The primary goal of this project is to increase
              student achievement and success in developmental algebra. The project is
              attaining this goal by implementing reforms in the areas of pedagogy and course
              administration. To support the implementation of these reforms, a
              technology-enhanced Mathematics Learning Laboratory (MLL) is dedicated to the
              mathematical development of over 1000 underprepared students each year. Reform
              in course administration includes a competency-based approach permitting
              students to have multiple tries to pass electronically generated and graded
              examinations. Pedagogy reforms are focusing on a blend of technology-based
              assessment, student tutorials, and classroom instruction, that is transforming
              the classroom into an active learning environment where the mathematical needs
              of each individual student can be met.A key part of our plan draws upon the NSF
              funded project, An Expert System For The Efficient Assessment of Mathematical
              Knowledge ( NSF ESI-9350484 ), which is being used by students to assess their
              existing levels of mathematical knowledge. This project is also adapting and
              implementing themes and techniques from two previous NSF supported projects:
              Connected Mathematics and Interactive Mathematics Program.
