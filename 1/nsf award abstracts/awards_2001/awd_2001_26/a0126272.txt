This US-Argentina award will fund a collaborative project
              between Dr. Ricardo H. Nochetto, University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP),
              in collaboration with Drs. Hugo A. Aimar and Eleonar O. Harboure, Instituto de
              Matematica Aplicada del Litoral (IMAL), Universidad Nacional del Litoral in
              Santa Fe, Argentina, and Dr. Carlos Cabrelli of FCEyN, Universidad de Buenos
              Aires in Argentina.  Their research is a mix of classical and functional
              analysis as applied to the practical, numerical solution of partial
              differential equations (PDE).  The problem is one of approximating solutions by
              means of mathematical objects that can be computed. 

This project will build
              upon the strengths and complementary interests of each group, to collaborate on
              the topics of harmonic and numerical analysis.  UMCP has expertise on
              adaptivity for linear and nonlinear PDE as well as basic wavelet theory and
              applications.  The IMAL has expertise on wavelet applications to PDE and Besov
              spaces.  They will facilitate an ongoing collaboration by bringing both sides
              together for six visits over two years.  In addition, they will include
              advanced graduate students and postdocs.  This pairing will promote the
              cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques between the two research areas,
              institutions and countries.
