Abstract    :
              In the past several years, combinatorial techniques have revolutionized certain
              aspects of chemistry. One of the limiting factors in the implementation of this
              state-of-the-art approach is the need for high-throughput screening techniques.
              This proposal is adapting several procedures from the educational and
              commercial literature and implementing them into the undergraduate chemistry
              curriculum using a 96-well plate reader. Students are monitoring protein
              folding, conducting enzyme kinetics, screening libraries for phosphatase
              inhibitors, and developing an ELISA technique with the microtiter plate reader.
              These activities are introducing students to high-throughput, microtiter plate
              techniques, providing information for a statistical analysis of a large pool of
              data, and increasing the capacity for research-based and discovery laboratory
              activities. In addition, the library screening activity is being adapted for
              use in an outreach program with minority elementary and middle-school students.
              The impact of this proposal is being evaluated by student performance in both
              the laboratory and classroom portion of the course via test and survey
              questions. Dissemination of the results of this proposal will be presented
              through a national CUR workshop, publications, and outreach activities.
