Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)

Marymount College, a women's college, is
              incorporating a collaborative inquiry-based approach to teaching physiological
              principles in six laboratory courses by making data collection, analysis and
              presentation consistent with present technology. This incorporation involves
              two phases and aims to overcome present impediments of incomplete and
              inconsistent experimental data collection, low student participation and lack
              of time for students to thoroughly understand concepts. The project is adapted
              from a NSF-funded program for physiology-based courses at Goshen College (CCLI
              # 9950383). Students are using more graphic data representation and apply
              critical thinking skills to data analysis and the development of creative
              hypotheses. Evaluation of critical thinking skills is being inventoried through
              questionnaires and surveys. Dissemination of assessment will occur through
              participation in undergraduate conferences, publications and development of Web
              sites.
