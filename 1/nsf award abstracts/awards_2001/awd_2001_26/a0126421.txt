Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

The goals of this project are to narrow the gaps between
              textbook concepts and real world chemistry, and between student interests and
              student laboratory experiences. These goals are being accomplished by
              structuring laboratories for all chemistry courses around the common theme of
              the environment, by stressing the use of instrumental techniques, and by adding
              a service learning component. This project is adapting the Topic Oriented
              Approach Development concept from the University of Wisconsin and implementing
              specific laboratory experiments from the educational literature. Students are
              placed in real world situations so they will find chemistry laboratories
              interesting, relevant, and applicable to their world. The chemistry courses
              serve non-chemistry and non-science majors at an environmental liberal arts
              college, and thus the focus on environmentally related topics is especially
              relevant to student interests. The use of instrumental methods in the
              laboratories adds a dimension of interest, skill, and analytical thought,
              improving both teaching and student learning.
