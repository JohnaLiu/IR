Abstract    :
              Abstract  Understanding Socialization and Adolescent Development in
              Multi-cultural Contexts  Andrew Supple  Communities in the southeastern
              United States have experienced rapid increases in proportions of foreign-born
              individuals over the last decade.  Demographic changes have been especially
              dramatic in No. Carolina and Georgia, two states among the top ten in terms of
              percentage increases in foreign-born populations during the 1990s.  Changes in
              the demographic composition of local communities in these states have created
              an acute need for a sound knowledge base regarding the socialization influences
              and outcomes in these populations.  Moreover, community leaders, outreach
              service providers, and educators will need reliable data and culturally
              relevant theoretical frameworks to disseminate knowledge about socialization
              processes among children and adolescents from immigrant families. The purpose
              of this project is to create a multidisciplinary and cross-institutional
              research team from three universities in the southeastern United States through
              a series of workshops.  The workshops  are designed to develop a strategic plan
              for research on the socialization of children and adolescents in immigrant
              families.
