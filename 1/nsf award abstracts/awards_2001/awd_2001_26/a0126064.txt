Abstract    :
              The investigator would apply a method of expert-knowledge and statistical
              technique to the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) data
              set to identify and measure latent competencies that students must use to get
              correct solutions to test problems.  The TIMSS was conducted in both
              mathematics and science, but the final negotiated project will be conducted in
              mathematics only.  The purpose of this investigation is to provide a technique
              that can help classroom teachers and administrators make better use of test
              score data.  The investigator has developed a technique (Rule Space method) to
              enable the creation of a scale score on underlying knowledge states.  This
              process will test through statistical analysis the existence of attributes of
              the test items that identify cognitive processing skills and knowledge
              underlying student performance.
