Abstract    :
              Engineering - Civil (54)
Our project builds on previous work (CCLI 9952577) to
              gather high quality digital videos and still photographs to enhance
              environmental and water resource engineering education resources for educators.
              The publication and dissemination of these materials provides educators with
              the instructions to utilize these high quality digital materials in a variety
              of educational settings such as overhead transparencies, PowerPoint
              presentations, and computer based instructions. Our materials have the
              potential for use in long distance education courses. We are providing these
              materials to help educators in K-12 to foster environmental education through
              our "What Do Environmental and Water Resource Engineers Design?" web site.
              

To obtain the digital images, we have gone on location, photographing
              existing
operations, renovations, and construction projects at a range small
              to large-scale projects.
Topics include unit processes in water and
              wastewater, hydraulic structures and open
channel flow. We are disseminating
              our text and video materials through a publisher and our Internet site.
