Abstract    :
              This workshop will focus on the best approaches to sequencing the gene fraction
              of the maize genome and will develop a comprehensive plan for achieving this
              goal. Maize is the best studied genetic system in the grasses, with exceptional
              strengths in facilitating our understanding of plant development, gene
              regulation (including epigenetics), stress tolerance, transposable element
              function, and genome evolution. Physical and genetic mapping, mutagenesis,
              reverse genetics, transformation, and other molecular tools are reliably
              employed in maize research. However, a major limitation to the continued
              productivity of maize as a model plant species is the lack of comprehensive
              understanding of gene content and arrangement of the maize genome. There are
              now technologies for accomplishing this task in a short time frame and at low
              cost. Thus, the goal of obtaining a completed sequence of the gene-rich regions
              of the maize genome is feasible, worthy and timely.  The chief goal of the
              workshop will be to bring together experts in high throughput genomic
              sequencing and analyses with experts knowledgeable about the properties of the
              maize genome. This small group, comprising scientists from academia and
              industry, and observers from government agencies, will discuss strategies for
              sequencing the maize gene space. The output from this workshop will be a
              comprehensive plan for proceeding with sequencing the maize genome, an
              estimation of the resources required, and a timetable for action. This document
              will be circulated to the wider genetics and genomics communities for comment
              prior to finalizing the document. A timetable for follow up activities will
              also be developed.
