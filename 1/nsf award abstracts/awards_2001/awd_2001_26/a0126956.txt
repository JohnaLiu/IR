Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this project is to develop adequate communication tools
              within mathematics courses delivered by web-based distance learning
              technologies. Web-environments for distance learning college courses do not
              provide basic communication tools for math courses. Also in face-to-face math
              courses, commuter students especially, need to collaborate outside of class.
              Assessment of distance math instructors indicates they wish to create/edit math
              notation, conceptual diagrams and graphs directly in online postings. The goals
              of this project are: 1) Provide math instructors and students with direct
              creation/editing of math notation, conceptual drawings and graphs in online
              postings. 2) Adapt existing web-based and face-to-face college math courses to
              include basic communication tools for math. 3) Provide faculty
              development/support for re-design of distance ed. math courses. 4) Research
              more natural/diagrammatic math communication and math learning. 5) Spread basic
              math distance ed. communication tools.
