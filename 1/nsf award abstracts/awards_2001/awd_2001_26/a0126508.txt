Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to organize a workshop that will bring together
              an exciting, interdisciplinary group of researchers working on new issues in
              learning and development.  In addition to presentations by researchers using
              new methods and techniques in child learning and development, the workshop will
              also include presentations by scholars in the fields of psychology and
              neuroscience where results from animal research may profoundly impact our
              understanding of learning and development in humans.  The workshop will
              complement a series of in-house lectures by grant members who will be giving
              'state-of-the-art' presentations on individual research areas.  The goal of the
              proposed Workshop is therefore to help forge a new interdisciplinary working
              framework for future collaborative research on child learning and development
              at Brown University.
