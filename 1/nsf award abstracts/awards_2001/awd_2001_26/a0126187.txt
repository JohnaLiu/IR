This award provides support for a 2 year modeling effort to
              study the dynamics of Pine Island Glacier (PIG).  The discharge from the PIG
              constitutes the largest mass loss from any single West Antarctic ice stream. 
              Satellite observations indicate that this outlet glacier is experiencing
              ongoing thinning and acceleration.  The emphasis of this work will be on
              understanding the cause and the near-term projection of the observed thinning
              of PIG.  Model experiments will address the hypothesis that the observed
              changes were caused by the loss of a buttressing ice shelf, and that the
              changes will continue in the form of an upglacier  propagating wave of thinning
              and acceleration.  To perform this work a numerical model of the coupled mass,
              energy, and momentum balance of Pine Island Glacier basin will be developed. 
              The model will comprise four modular components, which will be coupled and then
              benchmarked against the European Ice Sheet Modeling Inititative (EISMINT) model
              intercomparison.   The model will then be applied to the thinning of Pine
              Island Glacier using likely ice-shelf histories and possible basal boundary
              conditions to learn which may be accurate and to assess possible future
              behavior.  The primary expected result will be an improved understanding of the
              importance of ice-shelf buttressing and the potential for inland thinning due
              to the reduction of ice-shelf drag.
