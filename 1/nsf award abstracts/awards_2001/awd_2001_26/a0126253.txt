Abstract    :
              Considerable interest and debate surround the problem of uplift and geomorphic
              evolution of areas undergoing arc magmatism and arc accretion to continental
              margins. The Sierra Nevada of California, a deeply eroded remnant of a late
              Mesozoic magmatic arc, has conventionally been thought to have been uplifted in
              late Cenozoic time, however this conclusion has been challenged by low
              temperature geochronologic studies suggesting high relief as early as late
              Mesozoic. This project will measure river incision rates in the Sierra Nevada
              by comparing elevations of dated cave deposits with present day river
              elevations. These data will be incorporated in a model of Sierra landscape
              evolution in order to provide a test of the competing mutually exclusive
              hypotheses. Results will be of considerable regional importance and have clear
              implications on broader issues.
