Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
This project is providing opportunities for students
              to design, conduct, analyze, and report on inquiry-based laboratory projects in
              developmental biology by adapting from the contemporary research literature
              techniques of microsurgery, microinjection, and digital imaging for use by
              undergraduates. These research techniques are being implemented within
              inquiry-based undergraduate laboratory projects that investigate cell fate,
              cell morphology, and organogenesis. Thus, students have valuable opportunities
              to incorporate
some of the most important and broadly applicable techniques of
              modern developmental biology research within experimental questions of their
              own design. By actively engaging students in all phases of scientific inquiry
              from experimental design through execution, analysis, and communication,
              students learn valuable technical, intellectual, communicative, and
              collaborative skills. Further, students are merging both classical embryology
              and modern developmental biology to obtain unique first-hand perspectives on
              how animal form and function arise.
