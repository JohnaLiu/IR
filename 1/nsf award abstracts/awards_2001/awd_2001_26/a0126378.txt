              ABSTRACT

The Biogeochemical Aftermath of Neoproterozoic Ice Ages

The
              proposed research aims to critically test the celebrated Snowball Earth
              hypothesis, which predicts that several times in the Neoproterozoic (543-1000
              million years ago), the entire planet was blanketed from the poles to equator
              with continental glaciers and sea ice.  To overcome such extreme conditions it
              has been suggested that over millions of years atmospheric carbon dioxide
              concentration must have risen to over 100 times its present inventory,
              eventually building up enough greenhouse gas to warm the frozen planet.  On one
              hand, the materials required for the enigmatic carbonates (which cap these
              Neoproterozoic glacial sediments worldwide) may have come from the intense
              weathering of the continents under such a CO2-charged atmosphere. 
              Alternatively, the source of these materials may have derived from the deep
              ocean where sulfate-reducing bacteria dominated the water column - similar to
              the present-day anoxic Black Sea - during widespread, yet less severe and
              shorter glacial epochs.  Testing the validity of either of these end-member
              hypotheses will require detailed study of the elemental, mineralogical,
              textural, and stable isotopic compositions of the cap carbonates.  Samples from
              the Otavi Group in Namibia (where the critical evidence for global glaciation
              was first amassed), and in demonstrably equivalent strata from the Bambui and
              Macaubas groups of Brazil will be analyzed.  Regional mapping and
              high-resolution stratigraphic studies of the thick, carbonate-dominated
              Brazilian successions will aid in the evaluation of models that seek to explain
              these severe oscillations of Precambrian climate.
