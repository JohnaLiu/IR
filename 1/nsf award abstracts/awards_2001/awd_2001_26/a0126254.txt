Abstract    :
              Engineering - Electrical (55)

The project develops an integrated laboratory
              for state-of-the-art circuit design and implementation using a CAD system and
              printed circuit board (PCB) prototyping. It is based on similar programs at
              several other universities. The laboratory is being integrated into the
              sequence of digital design courses so that the material is introduced
              gradually. The evaluation plan compares the complexity, performance, design
              time, and packaging of past senior design projects to those developed using the
              new laboratory. In addition they will use course evaluation, senior exit
              interviews, and alumni surveys to evaluate the usefulness of the CAD and PCB
              training. They plan to post laboratory manuals and examples of design projects
              on the web and to publish noteworthy outcomes with journal and conference
              publications.
