Abstract    :
              Physics (13) The Open-Source Physics Education, OPEN, project is a synergy of
              curriculum development, computational physics, and physics education research
              based on the Principal Investigator's current WebPhysics project. Material from
              the OPEN project is being incorporated into three new texts: Gould, Tobochnik,
              and Christian's Computer Simulation Methods, the Principal Investigator's
              Open-Source Physics, and a topical Physlets workbook that can be used with a
              variety of standard texts. The OPEN project makes a large number of Java
              simulations available for physics education using the GNU Open-Source model for
              the source code. In addition, it entails the creation and maintenance of a
              website for the distribution of compiled applets and examples of interactive
              curricular material. The OPEN project plans two one-week summer workshops and
              full- and half-day workshops at national and regional professional meetings. A
              formal assessment of students' cognitive gains is being undertaken. The OPEN
              project impacts science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education
              nationwide through the distribution of a wide variety of class-tested
              interactive computer-based materials using both commercial and non-commercial
              distribution. The OPEN project is studying the conditions under which these
              materials can increase student learning. This assessment is of interest to all
              researchers studying the effectiveness of animation and simulation in teaching
              and learning.
