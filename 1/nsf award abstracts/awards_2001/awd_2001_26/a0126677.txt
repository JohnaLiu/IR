Abstract    :
              Engineering - Electrical (55)

The project is developing a laboratory for an
              existing two-course sequence in electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and in the
              senior design projects in this area. Industrial laboratories and the labs at
              other academic institutions serve as models for the University
              Michigan-Dearborn lab. Because the institution is in the heartland of the US
              automotive industry, the experiments emphasizes automotive applications. The
              laboratory is providing hands-on experience with experiments on radiated
              emission, radiated immunity, conducted emission, and conducted immunity EMC
              testing. The evaluation uses student and graduate surveys that are conducted
              with assistance from the University's Center for Engineering Education and
              Practice and an industrial advisory committee. Dissemination plans include
              posting information on the laboratory web site and publishing conference papers
              and journal articles.
