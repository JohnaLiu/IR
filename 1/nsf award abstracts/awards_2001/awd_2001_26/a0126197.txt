Abstract    :
              In recent years, researchers have developed and studied a variety of
              instructional materials that can support students learning how to conduct
              investigations in project-based science classrooms, but few classroom
              assessment materials and tools have been developed to support these materials. 
              Ideally, such assessments would give teachers a better understanding of what
              students know at any point in a project in order to adjust and improve
              instruction.  This project will develop, test, and evaluate classroom
              assessments for extended science projects that are supported by handheld
              computers.  To develop the assessments, the investigators will create on teams
              of teachers, assessment specialists, software developers, and researchers to
              develop these tools. The project will rely on a small group of teachers in the
              Beaufort County Public Schools to try out the assessments. SRI researchers will
              evaluate factors associated with adoption of the handheld tools in a variety of
              classrooms and measure its effectiveness in improving teaching and learning.
