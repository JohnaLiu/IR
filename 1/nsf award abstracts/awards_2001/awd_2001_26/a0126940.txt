Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21). This project is developing a significant set of
              enhancements and extensions to the functionality of WeBWorK, an Internet-based
              system for generating and delivering homework problems to students, already in
              use at a number of colleges and universities in the country. These enhancements
              and extensions are streamlining and modularizing the system code and improving
              its functionality, speed and reliability. In addition to acting as a hub to
              integrate contributions and ideas from users, the project team is forming a
              comprehensive library of WeBWorK problems covering topics such as single and
              multivariable calculus, differential equations, finite mathematics, college
              algebra, linear algebra, statistics, and other subjects, thus expanding the
              current collection of calculus and differential equation problems and
              facilitating the sharing and selection of WeBWorK problems. The WeBWorK system
              and problem library are expected to be freely distributed to educational
              institutions.
