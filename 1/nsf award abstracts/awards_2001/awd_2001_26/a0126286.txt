Abstract    :
              This award provides one year of support  to use newly developed technology in
              which an  ice-core melter is coupled with both an Inductively Coupled Plasma -
              Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS) and a traditional Continuous Flow Analysis (CFA)
              system, to measure a continuous time series of chemical and trace element
              deposition on the Siple Dome ice core from West Antarctica. A coupled ice-core
              melter, ICP-MS, and CFA system will be used to measure concentrations of a
              number of elements, isotopes and chemical species at very high depth resolution
              (~2-cm) in the top 54 m of the Siple Dome A-core. Pilot data from analyses of
              ~6 m from the nearby but much lower accumulation J-core site at Siple Dome,
              together with more extensive results from Summit, Greenland, indicate that it
              will be possible to obtain exactly co-registered, high-quality records of at
              least 12 seasonally varying elements (sodium, magnesium, aluminum, potassium,
              calcium, iron, manganese, rubidium, strontium, zirconium, barium, lead) and
              three other chemical species and ions (ammonium, nitrate, calcium ion) with
              this system. Under this proposed research, we will also add continuous
              measurements of sulfate to our system. Because more than sufficient core from
              Siple Dome for these depths is archived at the National Ice Core Laboratory,
              the proposed research will require no fieldwork.  The continuous, very
              high-resolution, ~350-y record of these elemental tracers will enhance the
              value of previous chemical and isotopic measurements that have been made on the
              Siple Dome core and will be particularly valuable for comparisons between
              ice-core proxies and modern instrumental data related to El Nino-Southern
              Oscillation (ENSO) as well as for validation of model simulations of
              atmospheric circulation. These data, and the expertise gained through this
              research, will be invaluable when this novel chemical analysis technology is
              eventually applied to deep ice-core records for the study of rapid
              climate-change events.
