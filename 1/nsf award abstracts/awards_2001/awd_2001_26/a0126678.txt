Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)
Stonehill College is integrating high field FT-NMR across the
              entire chemistry curriculum in order to strengthen the ability of students to
              retain what they learn, draw connections between courses, interpret
              spectroscopic results, and design experiments. This project is impacting
              chemistry, biochemistry, biology, environmental studies, and computer
              engineering majors. The incorporation of high field FT-NMR across the entire
              curriculum is based on NSF-DUE funded projects (Nolen-DUE008827,
              Smart-DUE0087655, Wallace-DUE9952343, McDonald-DUE9850423, Gaede-DUE9750847)
              and on a Journal of Chemical Education (JCE) article (Davis-JCE, 99). Most
              experiments have been adapted from JCE or NSF-DUE funded projects and
              implemented into our curriculum. For example, in General Chemistry, students
              are investigating electronegativity as well as the heavy atom effect by
              obtaining C-13 NMR spectra of halogenated methanes (Baer-JCE, 99). In Organic
              Chemistry, C-13 NMR is being introduced early in the semester (Reeves-JCE, 98),
              eventually leading to the introduction of H-NMR. Once the basics are
              established, NMR is then being used for structure determination, to determine
              optical purity (Viswanathan-JCE, 95), to study Markovnikov verses
              anti-Markovnikov hydration (Smart-DUE0087655, Nolan-DUE008827, Blankespoor-JCE,
              91), and to determine the stereochemistry of hydride reduction
              (McDonald-DUE9850423). In Instrumental Analysis, students are exploring how
              different parameters change the appearance of a spectrum (Gaede-DUE9750847) and
              investigating the nuclear Overhauser effect (Schmedake-JCE, 96). In Physical
              Chemistry students are performing variable temperature NMR kinetic and
              thermodynamic studies (McDonald-DUE9850423, Gallaher-JCE, 96). Advance NMR
              techniques (two-dimensional, heteronuclear, isotopic labeling, etc.) are
              becoming an integral part of Biochemistry, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Advanced
              Inorganic Chemistry and student/faculty research.
