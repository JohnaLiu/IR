Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
Exercise physiology is fundamental for researchers and
              majors in health fitness, athletic training,
physical education, and health
              education. Not unlike other sciences, exercise physiology
instruction that
              provides students with iihands-onl. laboratory experiences creates the
              most
positive learning climate, leads to a more complete understanding of
              basic physiological
processes, and increases comprehension of scientific
              principles, concepts and methods.
Currently, due to lack of metabolic
              analyzing equipment, the instruction of many exercise
physiology laboratory
              activities has been done via more traditional demonstration methods than
full
              and active student participation in the exercises themselves. The acquisition
              of key
instructional equipment (metabolic analyzer and treadmill) will expand
              and strengthen the
undergraduate student's experience in exercise physiology
              and help foster a direct problem-
solving approach to the learning process in
              scheduled laboratory sessions, independent research
or other out-of-class
              projects. The objectives of this project are two-fold: a) to provide
              expired
gas analyzing instrumentation to enable students to study several
              fundamental exercise
physiology principles that cannot be investigated with
              the current equipment and b) to promote
and encourage active learning and
              student research opportunities. The improved learning and
research resulting
              from the integration of the requested equipment into the curriculum
              will
advance the college's commitment to undergraduate research throughout the
              academic program.
