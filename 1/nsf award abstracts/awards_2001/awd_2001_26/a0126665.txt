              Engineering - Engineering Technology (58)

This A & I project adapts material
              developed at the Northeast Center for Telecommunications Technology (NCTT) to
              improve the existing lightwave communication laboratory at Three Rivers
              Community College. The project is adding fiber optic wavelength division
              multiplexing capability to their existing laboratory and providing students
              with a hands-on experience with sophisticated equipment. They are adapting four
              experiments developed by NCTT and are considering four new ones based on
              suggestions by their industry partners. In the evaluation effort, they will
              analyze student report, written exams, and the students' performance on
              practical exams to determine if the students achieve the learning objectives.
              The dissemination plan involves presentation to PHOTON project participants, at
              the NCTT workshop, and at national conferences along with publications in the
              PROTON and NCTT newsletters and in professional journals.
