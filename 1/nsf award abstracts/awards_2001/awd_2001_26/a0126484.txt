Abstract    :
              Earth Systems Science (40)
A series of activities are being undertaken as a
              first step in the development of a GIS laboratory at Prairie View A&M
              University. Visits to the GIS facilities at the University of Texas-Austin,
              Texas A&M University, and Houston Community College are designed to acquaint us
              with high quality academic programs and identify exemplary materials for
              adaptation. Faculty development activities, including attendance at GIS
              workshops, are being undertaken.
