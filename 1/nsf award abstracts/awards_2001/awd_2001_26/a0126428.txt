An ad hoc  committee under the auspices of the
              National Research Council (NAS) - Board on Earth Sciences and Resources (BESR)
              will be charged with the review of the science objectives and implementation
              planning of the three components of NSF's EarthScope initiative.  They are:
              United States Seismic Array (USArray), the San Andreas Fault Observatory at
              Depth (SAFOD), and the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO).  EarthScope is an
              NSF-led initiative designed to apply modern observational, analytical, and
              telecommunications technologies to investigate the structure, dynamics and
              evolution of the North American continent, and the physical processes
              controlling earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.  It is anticipated that the
              results of the EarthScope initiative will provide a foundation for fundamental
              and applied geoscience research throughout the United States.
