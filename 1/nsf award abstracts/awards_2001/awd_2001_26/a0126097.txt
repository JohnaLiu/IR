This project will involve a combined geochemical, isotopic,
              and chronological study of Galapagos lava flows in order to constrain the
              origin of the Galapagos hotspot and to compare it to other oceanic hotspots,
              such as Hawaii.  An important obstacle to evaluating the temporal evolution of
              Galapagos volcanoes has been the lack of an eruption time scale.  This project
              will rely heavily on the relatively new dating method of surface exposure
              dating (using cosmic-ray-produced nuclides such as 3He and 36Cl) to determine
              lava flow ages.  Combining the new age information with the geochemical data
              (i.e. the isotopes of strontium, neodymium, lead and helium) will help
              determine if the large geochemical differences between Galapagos volcanoes are
              related to temporal or spatial variability, which is crucial to hotspot models.
               One key goal of the research will be to evaluate temporal evolution at Cerro
              Azul and Fernandina, the two most active volcanoes in the western end
              archipelago which are thought to be near the center of the present-day hotspot.
               The project will also generate a west-to-east geochemical transect from
              Fernandina to San Cristobal to evaluate the hotspot model in the paradigm of
              plate tectonics.  New field work will provide a geochemical comparison of these
              results to the northern volcanoes on Pinta and Marchena which are presently
              difficult to explain in standard hotspot models.
