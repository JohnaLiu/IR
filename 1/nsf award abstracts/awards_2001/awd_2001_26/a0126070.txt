Abstract    :
              
In real world learning situations, a wide variety of contextual cues become
              associated with gradually formed common sense knowledge.  In contrast, school
              learning often emphasizes abstract symbolic manipulations, which can lead to
              students' difficulties in applying their knowledge to real world examples.  To
              help students make intuitive sense of physics, it is necessary to address
              sensory stimuli that are explicitly or implicitly associated with students'
              common sense knowledge from experience.  To do this, it is important to
              understand what contextual cues are involved in learning and how they affect
              the learning process.   

For selected topics in introductory physics, we
              will conduct systematic qualitative studies to identify and investigate
              specific context cues that affect students' learning; we will develop methods
              to measure, evaluate and represent the involvement of context cues in different
              stages of learning; we will also develop physics activities in virtual
              environments to investigate experimentally how low-level sensory cues such as
              haptic feedback affect learning and how such cues may be addressed in
              instruction.

The resulting insights into the interplay between context and
              learning, and integration of contextual and sensory information into virtual
              environments will broaden the horizon of active engagement teaching methods and
              inform the development of teaching technologies.
