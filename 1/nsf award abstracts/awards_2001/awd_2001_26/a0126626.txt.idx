Abstract    :
              Abstract  Learning & Develoment Across Cultures:  A Workshop  Patricia M.
              Greenfield  A series of two workshops (a planning meeting and a larger
              conference) will bring together international scholars to formulate a research
              agenda and a program of research activities.  The cultural construction of
              learning and its relation to development is the rationale for the workshop.  A
              developmental perspective will guide the organization of the workshop topics: 
              (1) Learning in infancy across cultures; (2) Learning in childhood across
              cultures; (3) Adolescent learning across cultures; (4) Adulthood learning
              across cultures; and (5) Learning and aging across cultures.  The objective
              will be to scrutinize learning similarities and differences as a way of
              understanding development.  The multiphase approach will help learning
              scientists understand the developmental precursors and learning phenomena, as
              well as developmental consequences.    The results of the workshop will
              include a reseach agenda to guide the development of future research projects
              about children's learning in varying cultural contexts.  Another anticipated
              outcome will be a book that can serve as an international textbook on the role
              of cultural differences and universal stages in human development.
