A major shortage of qualified mathematics teachers
              exists and is expected to worsen. By adapting and implementing Queens College's
              (QC/CUNY) exemplary TIME2000 program (NSF DUE 9652972), the pipeline of
              prospective mathematics teachers at the middle and high school levels is being
              increased. TIMEQCC is establishing a mathematics-education program at
              Queensborough Community College (QCC) and increasing the junior year cohort in
              TIME2000. The success of TIME2000 has been demonstrated through increased
              retention rates, media recognition, and additional funding from the college and
              a private foundation. The goal of increasing the pipeline of qualified teachers
              is being accomplished by targeting the under-recruited population of QCC
              students who have completed college algebra or precalculus with a B or better
              and then retaining them using two major innovations. These innovations are:

              1. Cross-campus counseling and teaching (QCC and QC), including an
              interdisciplinary mathematics education course.
 2. Implementing the
              successful QCC upper level mathematics retention model -- tutoring in upper
              level mathematics courses, study groups based on the Uri Treisman model, and
              tutoring internships in the Mathematics Learning Center.

Working closely
              with the TIME2000 faculty at QC, the structure of the program is being adapted
              for the community college student. Formative and summative evaluations are
              being conducted using QC's established evaluation procedures. Dissemination is
              through the CUNY Council of Math Chairs and national on-line conferences.
