Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will develop a
              cost-effective commercial method for production of fully dense structural
              ceramic parts of complex shape directly by self-propagating high-temperature
              synthesis (SHS) reaction under pressure using the Electroconsolidation process.
              Many already developed high-performance ceramic materials are not used because
              of the high cost to fabricate components. The use of SHS to make parts offers
              considerable opportunity to reduce costs if dense, shaped parts can be made
              directly from reactant powder mix. Electroconsolidation is a newly developed
              process for low-cost pressure-assisted densification that is uniquely capable
              to meet this requirement. The project will determine the technical and economic
              feasibility of employing Electroconsolidation for making dense silicon carbide.
              

The commercial benefit if successful, would be products made from
              high-performance materials such as carbides, silicides, and carbo-nitrides
              could become more economical to
produce.
