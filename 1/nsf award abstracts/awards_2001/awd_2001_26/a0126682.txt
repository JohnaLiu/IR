Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)
As a part of the CCLI A&I grant entitled
              Implementing Reform in an Internet-Based
Classroom, the mathematics department
              at East Tennessee State University implemented a pilot program, which provided
              a technology-intensive laboratory experience for certain sections of elementary
              statistics courses. This experiment showed that the use of technology in
              elementary statistics increases retention, fosters participation, and improves
              conceptual understanding of statistical concepts. Indeed, students in the
              program were significantly more successful than those in the general
              population.

In order for technology to truly make a difference in student
              learning, it must be delivered within an entirely different type of course.
              Hence, this project creates an elementary statistics course that incorporates
              software packages such as Minitab, online materials such as those in the Rice
              Virtual Lab in Statistics (NSF DUE 9751307, 07/97-06/99), and the best of
              curriculum reform. The best means to do so is to transform statistical
              instruction into a multi-faceted program that develops students' mathematical
              abilities in a step-by-step process.
