Abstract    :
              Abstract  Planning a Center for the Study of Children's Development in
              Relationships   Julia Torquati, Lisa Crockett, Carolyn Edwards, Marcela
              Raffaelli, and  Ross Thompson  	Relationships are critical to intellectual,
              emotional, social, and physical growth in childhood.  Relationships with
              parents, grandparents, siblings, peers, teachers, caregivers in day care and
              preschool, and others contribute to the development of skills, respond to the
              child's individuality, facilitate new learning and growth, and provide sources
              of security and support.  Relationships have recently been described as the
              "active ingredients" of healthy development by the Committee on Integrating the
              Science of Early Childhood Development of the National Academy of Sciences in
              their report, From Neurons to Neighborhoods.  But although much is known about
              the impact of specific relationships on children's development, there are many
              limitations to current understanding.  This project proposal requests support
              to enable investigators to advance the science of relationships in development
              by planning the creation of a Center for the Study of Children's Development in
              Relationships.   	The overarching goal of the Center is to develop the
              capacity for multi-disciplinary research on children's development within
              relationships, from infancy through adolescence, encompassing the varieties of
              relationships and develop-mental processes characteristic of childhood.  More
              specifically, researchers at the Center will develop:  (a) a shared theoretical
              view of development and relationships to guide their work, (b) a framework for
              coordination among specific research activities conducted by research
              scientists, (c) processes for scholarly exchanges through workshops,
              conferences, and networking opportunities, (d) educational activities for
              graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and visiting scientists, (e)
              associations with institutional and community resources concerned with
              children, (f) a repository for data and reports that already exist concerning
              development and relationships from both local and national sources, and (g)
              procedures for disseminating research conclusions to other scholars,
              communities, human service professionals, and policymakers.   	The goals of
              the proposed planning period are to inaugurate the development of this Center
              by building collaborative partnerships within the University of Nebraska, and
              with scholars at other institutions, and to initiate specific research programs
              by critically examining current research on children's relationships to
              identify gaps in conceptualization, measurement, populations studied, or
              developmental stages and transitions that have been examined.  During the
              proposed planning period, several activities will occur.  These include (a) an
              assessment of future research needs through monthly meetings, exchanges of
              reviews of the literature, and consulting with an advisory board of experts,
              (b) building multidisciplinary collaborations within the University, and with
              scholars outside it, (c) developing a shared theoretical framework through
              collaborative interaction, and (d) preparation and submission of a Center grant
              proposal.   	The Center for the Study of Children's Development in
              Relationships will also accomplish several ancillary goals.  First, it will
              provide an infrastructure for the integration of education and research on this
              important topic.  Second, it will broaden the representation of
              underrepresented groups through active recruitment of scholars, students, and
              research participants.  Finally, the work of Center scholars will enhance
              knowledge of the field through independent research activities and review of
              the research literature.
