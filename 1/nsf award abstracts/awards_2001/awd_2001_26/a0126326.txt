Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
The goal of this project is to strengthen the ability
              of students to use microscopic approaches to solve problems. The objectives are
              to integrate fluorescent and phase-contrast microscopy into all levels of the
              Wartburg College biology curriculum and to enhance student access to the
              instrumentation and their ability to use microscopic techniques in student
              research projects. Students are introduced to the use of fluorescent and
              phase-contrast microscopy in the introductory Biology course, and gain
              expertise in subsequent courses, Microbiology, Microbial Ecology, Cell Biology,
              and Student Research. These courses provide other opportunities for the use of
              these microscopes in inquiry-based labs and undergraduate research.
              Inquiry-based lab exercises are being developed as adaptations from the
              contemporary research literature. The students are also be trained in
              still-frame and video-capture techniques so they can document, present, and
              publish their results. The impact of the project on student learning is being
              assessed using cumulative digital image portfolios and lab practicals. The
              results of the assessment and student-generated projects will be disseminated
              through a Web site and presentations at national meetings.
