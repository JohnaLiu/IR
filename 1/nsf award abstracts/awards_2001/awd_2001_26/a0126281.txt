Abstract    :
              Basalt geochemistry records information about mantle dynamics, indicating that
              there are at least five reservoirs in the mantle. However, the dynamical
              meaning of such reservoirs is ill-constrained. Efforts to reconcile the full
              range of types of observational data have recently given rise to several new
              geodynamic models that include layers of different composition in the mantle.
              The investigators will evaluate these and related models, by using numerical
              models of thermo-chemical convection in the mantle to determine the geochemical
              signatures predicted by different dynamical models. Simulations will include
              tracers to represent various chemical species. Partial melting processes at
              ridges are taken into account, yielding fractionation between oceanic crust and
              lithosphere, and outgassing into the atmosphere. These processes have not been
              included in previous large-scale, fully dynamic, convective models. The
              simulations keep track of ancient oceanic crust, and include intrinsic density
              variations between eclogite and peridotite, as well as inhomogeneous heat
              production rates. The investigators will address the ability of their different
              models to reproduce some of the features of basalt, and to be in agreement with
              geodynamical observations such as the heat flow. They will also test the
              sensitivity of the results to petrologic and geodynamic parameters.
