Auburn University Children's Research Center Planning Grant

This award will support a series of
              activities to enhance the intellectual, administrative, and social
              infrastructures at Auburn University . Specific activities relevant to four
              broad aims will be supported. 

The project will build institutional capacity
              at Department, College, and University levels by (a) initiating and supporting
              cross-disciplinary inquiries on the nature and development of children's
              relationships and belief systems; (b) identifying and fostering relationships
              with nationally and internationally recognized experts in the conduct of this
              research; (c) establishing relationships that insure the participation of
              ethnic minority scholars in all aspects of research and that insure the
              participation of members from ethnic minority communities in research samples;
              (d) using existing structures for outreach in place at Auburn University to
              allow for efficient translation of research products into meaningful programs;
              and (e) laying the groundwork for a Data Center to house data and products from
              the Research Center and from national and international datasets concerning
              children's relationships. This Data Center will serve as a resource for Center
              faculty in terms of consultation and assistance for sampling and analysis and
              will serve as a portal to the larger community of developmental and learning
              scientists using the Internet. 

The project will assess research needs
              pertinent to the construction, maintenance, and elaboration of Center identity
              and focus by (a) fostering cross institution collaborations at national and
              international levels; (b) developing mechanisms to incorporate training
              activities for the next generation of developmental and learning scientists;
              (c) designing an administrative structure to guide the scientific mission of
              the Center; and (d) developing mission statements for Community and
              Scientific/Technical Advisory Panels who will serve as external evaluators of
              Center goals, activities, and products. 

The project will support ongoing
              research programs on interpersonal relationships and social transitions, plan
              new, large-scale studies of these phenomena, and identify mechanisms to support
              innovative pilot studies by (a) holding workshops with outside experts to
              provide training and technical assistance and to identify specific personnel
              needs for the Center; (b) identifying means/mechanisms to streamline and speed
              up data coding and sharing of large datasets (e.g., using Internet- 2 protocols
              to transfer video files) and to use existing facilities more efficiently; and
              (c) setting priorities for identifying and supporting pilot investigations by
              Center faculty and affiliates. 

The project will establish mechanisms for
              evaluating Center activities and products by (a) identifying and recruiting a
              Scientific/Technical Advisory Panel to evaluate the Center's goals, activities,
              and products in terms of their impact on the developmental and learning
              sciences and on their capacity to nurture a new generation of developmental and
              learning scientists from the Human Sciences; and (b) identifying and recruiting
              a Community Advisory Panel to provide guidance and feedback concerning the
              practical value of the Center's activities and products, especially with
              reference to our goal of including ethnic minority participants in every aspect
              of research
