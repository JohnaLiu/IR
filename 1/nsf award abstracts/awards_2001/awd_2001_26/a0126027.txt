Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
Muhlenberg College's Biology Department is committed
              to having students undertake long term, independent research projects, complete
              comprehensive data analysis and data presentation, and engage in intensive
              collaborative inquiry and investigative type exercises. Muhlenberg's 1998
              ILI-NSF grant ensured that these objectives were accomplished in the
              upper-level research-based courses through the use of computer-based
              technology. The current project is addressing the introductory biology
              sequence, and is an adaptation of the learnings provided by Project
              Kaleidoscope's "What Works," and similar efforts at Kutztown University (DUE
              9952337). Specifically, the project is implementing models for teaching plant
              and animal structure/function and cell/molecular biology laboratories while
              adapting computer technology to facilitate scientific inquiry. Our central goal
              is to expand the use of computer technology and the culture of science to
              students enrolled in the introductory biology laboratories. These courses are
              introducing the students to all elements of scientific inquiry through
              investigative exercises and doing independent research. The students are using
              computers, software, and peripherals to 1) record data from their short-term
              investigative and long-term independent experiments, 2) doing statistics and
              graphing, 3) placing data on the web and using web-based technology to access
              molecular databases, and 4) presenting their long-term projects in the format
              of a poster and/or oral presentation. Thus, the computer-based infrastructure
              is allowing the students to make even more sophisticated connections within and
              outside the laboratory.
