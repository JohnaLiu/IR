The Connecting Mathematics for Elementary Teachers
              (CMET) project is connecting prospective elementary teachers' learning of
              mathematics in mathematics content courses with how children understand and
              learn mathematics. The goals are to 1) enhance pre-service teachers'
              understanding of mathematics, 2) improve their teaching of mathematics, 3)
              improve prospective elementary teachers' understanding of how children learn
              and understand mathematics, 4) help them connect the mathematics they are
              learning with the mathematical concepts they will be teaching children, and 5)
              facilitate prospective elementary teachers understanding of the connection
              between the mathematics they will be teaching in elementary school to the
              mathematics and technological skills children learn in middle and high school.
              To achieve these goals, supplementary materials are being developed for one
              3-credit hour mathematical content course for elementary teachers. An expanded
              supplement of teaching notes is being developed for the instructors. The
              materials explore how children learn and understand mathematics, the
              mathematics actually taught in the elementary school, and the important
              connections at the elementary level to mathematics and the technological skills
              children learn in middle and secondary school. The project is emphasizing
              mathematics from children's perspectives and how this is directly related to
              the mathematics they are learning and will be teaching children. The materials
              are being evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively for their effectiveness at
              a test site. This project provides future teachers in-depth knowledge of how
              the subject matter they are learning relates to their future teaching.
