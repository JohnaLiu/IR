This proof-of-concept project will provide data to test the
              feasibility of a new method for soil water determination.  The method is based
              on thermalization of cosmic-ray neutrons by hydrogen atoms present within water
              molecules in soils.  It has several appealing characteristics: it is
              noninvasive (measurements can be conducted above the ground); it measures
              moisture at an intermediate scale; it may be scalable by changing instrument
              position and/or configuration; it can be easily automated for long-tern
              unsupervised monitoring; and it is safe (it does not use an artificial source
              of neutrons).  The proposed work will involve measurements and modeling of the
              intensity of cosmic-ray neutrons under controlled water content conditions. 
              The specific objectives of the proposed research are: (1) to identify and
              quantify any trends in neutron intensity with water content and with chemistry
              of soil; (2) to quantify the effect of water layer placed on top of soil on the
              neutron intensity; and (3) to determine what the measurement volume is and
              whether it can be controlled by instrument position above the ground or by
              instrument configuration.
