Abstract    :
              The 2001 International Working Conference on Active Networking (IWAN) will be
              held in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from September 30,  October 2nd, 2001.
              This conference is the pre-mier
international workshop in the emerging field
              of active and programmable networking. This
proposal requests funding to
              assist fourteen United States-based graduate students in attending
              this
meeting. Participation in workshops such as IWAN is an extremely
              important part of the gradu-ate
school experience, providing the opportunity
              to interact with more senior researchers and be
exposed to leading edge work
              in the field. In addition, IWAN offers the opportunity to interact
with
              international researchers in this area, as both the presenters and the
              attendees have had strong
European and Asian presences. The support requested
              in this proposal will enable the participation
of students who would otherwise
              be unable to attend IWAN 2001.
