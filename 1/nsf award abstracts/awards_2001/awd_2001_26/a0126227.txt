Abstract    :
              The PI's propose to conduct an in-depth study of the learning of secondary
              students engaged in making sense of complex system through participating in
              classroom participatory simulations.  In particular, the PI's will study the
              complimentarity of two forms of reasoning: object based and aggregate
              reasoning.  These forms of reasoning will be used to as resources to in making
              sense of complexity.  To do so, the PI's will extend the functionality of the
              HubNet Participatory Simulations architecture by building an integrated
              simulation and modeling environment (ISME).  This environment will be built to
              couple the networked simulations with object based (NetLogo) and aggregate
              Model-It) modeling tools.  Finally, the PI's will extend and refine the
              Participatory Simulation Activities (PSA) and through iterative curriculum
              design incorporate the PSA inot curricular units targeted for secondary
              classrooms.
