              Chemistry (12)

With the upgrade of our continuous wave NMR spectrometer to a
              multinuclear FT-NMR instrument, we are integrating NMR spectroscopy throughout
              our undergraduate curriculum. In the chemistry department, we are developing an
              exciting new curriculum which makes use of major laboratory instrumentation,
              including FT-NMR, in all of our chemistry courses. We are adapting and
              implementing a number of NMR experiments from the peer-reviewed chemical
              education literature for this purpose. For example, our new freshman curriculum
              include an integrated chemistry and biology course focusing on the environment.
              We are adapting a H-NMR study of mono-, di-, and trihalomethanes to examine the
              concepts of electronegativity and polarity in this course. These compounds are
              familiar to students through the discussion of trihalomethanes in the module on
              "Water Purification" which we have adapted from the NSF-supported
              ChemConnections initiative. In our Inorganic course, we are adapting a C-13 NMR
              experiment on the structure of fullerenes. In our more advanced courses we
              emphasize the integration of the various disciplines of chemistry to prevent
              our students from seeing each class as a separate discipline. To show this
              integration of knowledge we are using FT-NMR experiments throughout the
              curriculum in activities highlighting the relationship between the structure
              and properties of molecules. We are also integrating molecular modeling
              analysis of structure with NMR spectroscopy.
