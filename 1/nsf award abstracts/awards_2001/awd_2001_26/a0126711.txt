Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21). An "investigative classroom" is being established to
              give students writing space, personal access to Internet connected computers,
              space for collaborative work, and visual access to a SMART Board. The approach
              blends active learning, collaborative work among students, instructor led
              electronic demonstrations, and a minimal amount of lecturing. Instead learning
              activities are being implemented that exploit a variety of
              applications-oriented materials developed for calculus I and II over the last
              eight years under the aegis of NSF and other institutions. Collaborative,
              investigative exercises that start in class are used to generate longer-term
              group projects; and a computer algebra system, Maple, and the TI-89 calculator
              are used as aids to visualization and exploration.
