Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
Experiments that utilize optical spectroscopic methods
              adapted from the literature are being introduced in a coordinated fashion into
              four teaching laboratories as a means of increasing student understanding of
              interactions of light and matter. Students measure the absorbance and
              fluorescence of metalloporphyrins in a freshman-level inorganic chemistry
              laboratory. They characterize protein-DNA interactions, DNA-ligand
              thermodynamics and kinetics, and protein unfolding equilibrium and kinetics in
              upper-level biochemistry and chemistry laboratories using absorbance and
              fluorescence spectroscopy. In one laboratory course, students develop and test
              their own hypothesis for a well-defined biophysical problem. Web-based teaching
              tools are being developed and implemented to enhance and monitor student
              learning. Instrumentation to facilitate these activities include a UV-visible
              spectrophotometer, two scanning fluorometers (with computers/printers), and a
              rapid-mixing accessory for stopped-flow kinetics for dedicated use in the
              undergraduate teaching laboratories. This project is being assessed by an
              advisory board of chemistry and biology faculty and a teaching and learning
              specialist.
