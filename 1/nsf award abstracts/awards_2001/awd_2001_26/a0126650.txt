Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21). This "proof of concept" project is developing
              educational materials to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematical
              ideas for quantifying real world problems, enhancing problem solving skills,
              and improving students' ability to interpret results and further their
              understanding of the underlying problem. The investigators aim to counteract
              students' perception that mathematical modeling consists of ad hoc lists of
              methods and techniques, and to promote instead a view that mathematical
              modeling is anchored in a suite of general mathematical principles. Two drafts
              of textbooks -- a basic theory text as well as an advanced applications text --
              are under development and being tested. The approach and materials are also
              incorporating findings and new topical areas arising from on-going
              interdisciplinary research projects at the principal investigators'
              institution.
