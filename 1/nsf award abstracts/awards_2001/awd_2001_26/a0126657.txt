Abstract    :
                   Engineering - Materials Science (57)
In this project we are developing
              four hands-on interdisciplinary experiments from a variety of engineering
              laboratories within Rowan University. Our project is providing a model for
              hands-on interdisciplinary experimentation for use in introductory materials
              science courses. The development of these hands-on laboratory experiments are
              addressing concerns expressed by ABET and the Engineering Education Coalitions.
              The experiments will be incorporated into the curriculum at Rowan University.
              Our testing machines has been interfaced with computer data acquisition and
              control systems. Rather than purchasing new equipment this project is adapted
              from the work done by McDonald, Adams, and Mahajan. Our equipment will be
              modernized in a similar fashion to help our students perform, observe, and
              analyze the measurements that characterize the behavior of engineering
              materials. As a compliment to this laboratory experience we have our
              undergraduate students working with industrial sponsors in material science
              related research. By combining the two experiences, laboratory studies and
              fieldwork, students are gaining an appreciation for the practical aspects of
              materials characterization. The results of our project are being disseminated
              through relevant journals and through the use of an Engineering Clinic that
              emphasizes hands-on learning.
