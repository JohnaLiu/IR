The overall research goal of
              this proposal is to design, develop, evaluate and deploy Pragma, the next
              generation adaptive runtime infrastructure capable of reactively and
              proactively managing and optimizing application execution using current system
              and application state, predictive models for system behavior and application
              performance, and an agent based control network.  The overarching motivation
              for this research is to enable very large-scale, dynamically adaptive
              scientific and engineering simulations on widely distributed and highly
              heterogeneous and dynamic execution environments such as the computational
              "grid".    The design, development and evaluation of the proposed Pragma
              framework will be conducted in collaboration with the Astronomy Department at
              the University of Arizona in the context of a real-world astrophysical
              hydrodynamics simulation using adaptive mesh refinement and including
              multigroup flux-limited diffusion, self gravity, nuclear burning, and a complex
              equation of state.
