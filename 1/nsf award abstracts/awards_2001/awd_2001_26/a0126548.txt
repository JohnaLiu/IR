Abstract    :
              Physics (13)

This project aims to increase the number of undergraduate
              students exposed to physics at Vassar College and, through outreach, to
              increase the awareness of physics for both K-12 students and teachers. The
              project adapts a pedagogical technique--video analysis of everyday phenomena
              and events (e.g., sports, dance, people on swings)--that has been successfully
              used by a number of physics educators at the college and high school
              levels.

The Principal Investigator is developing a course for college
              students who do not typically enroll in science courses. In this course,
              students discover physics concepts by filming and analyzing digital video. Each
              student is loaned a laptop computer and digital video camera for the semester
              so that the students can film "physics" whenever they see it. The video is then
              transferred into the computer and analyzed with software that yields
              position-vs.-time data for the object(s). Further analysis allows the
              calculation of other quantities such as velocity, acceleration, forces, and
              energy. The first half of the course is a guided exploration of motion concepts
              through video. The second half of the course is devoted to group projects, in
              which teams of students create a multimedia DVD or CD-ROM that is appropriate
              for some level of K-12 students. As a final exercise, the students to go out to
              K-12 schools and present their projects to a class.
