Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)
The College is involved in an effort to transform regular
              classrooms into "Learning College" classrooms across the institution. As part
              of this institutional effort, the Chemistry Department is transforming course
              material to contextual formats. In this project, the faculty in chemistry are
              working together with Forensic Scientists from a regional crime laboratory to
              incorporate GC/MS experiments across the two-year college chemistry curriculum,
              including Organic Chemistry, Forensic Chemistry, College Chemistry, and General
              Chemistry courses. The objectives of the proposal are to: 1. adapt, adopt, and
              pilot test laboratory experiments in organic, forensic, general, and college
              chemistry courses; 2. provide faculty development on the use, calibration, and
              maintenance of the GC/MS; and 3. expand outreach to high school chemistry
              teachers and students through a Sinclair program called the Friday Visitation
              Program. The project is meeting the needs of high school and two-year college
              students for GC/MS experience as they matriculate to universities and enter the
              workforce as technicians. The results of the project will be disseminated
              through presentations at professional conferences and articles in journals.
