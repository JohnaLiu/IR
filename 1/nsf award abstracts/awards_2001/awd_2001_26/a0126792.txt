Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61) Ithaca College and EcoVillage at Ithaca, in
              partnership, are developing a science-intensive curriculum in environmental
              sustainability. Drawing on models of college/community affiliation successful
              on other campuses, such as Pennsylvania State University, the project adds four
              new laboratory courses (Ecologically Sustainable Communities, Sustainable Land
              Use, Energy Systems and Sustainable Energy, and Ecological Footprinting) and
              faculty sponsored summer research. The new courses are sequenced such that
              students are introduced to the approach of sustainability science in the first
              course, master the analytical tools involved in energy efficiency (combustion
              analyzers, watt and light meters, thermal submetering systems, as well as
              computerized building models) and land use (field surveys, and GPS/GIS) in the
              second and third courses, and unify their knowledge and apply it using the
              ecological footprinting approach in a final capstone course. Furthermore, all
              the core courses in the Environmental Studies Program are being modified to
              incorporate the curricular theme of environmental sustainability such that
              students are trained in all aspects of sustainability and are fully equipped to
              pursue careers at the science-policy interface with a solutions-oriented
              approach.
