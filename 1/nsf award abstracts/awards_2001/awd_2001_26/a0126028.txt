	This project is a balloon-borne experiment whose main
              goals include 1) a focused program of investigation of high latitude
              ionospheric electrodynamics (the study of the properties of electromagnetic
              radiation and the way in which it interacts with charged matter) using multiple
              long duration balloons launched in Antarctica, and 2) the investigation of the
              fast penetration of electric fields from the outer to the inner magnetosphere
              in response to external inputs.  The project is cooperative with Japanese X-ray
              and magnetometer investigators.  The bulk of the proposed effort will be
              focused on investigation of outstanding problems of the polar and auroral
              ionosphere such as the nature of polar cap convection under varying solar wind
              conditions, dynamics of the dayside cusp, the transient and steady state
              coupling of the solar wind to the magnetosphere, transient phenomena on wholly
              closed magnetic fields lines such as traveling convective vortices (TCVs) and
              those related to magnetic pulsations with periods greater than one second. 
              Another important effort will be to investigate the rapid transmission of
              ionospheric and magnetospheric electric fields from higher to lower latitudes
              in response to variations in the interplanetary magnetic field.
	This project
              consists of the construction, integration and testing of the electric field
              instruments for the geophysics payloads that are planned as part of the
              2002-2003 continuation of the Polar Patrol Balloon Program managed by the
              Japanese National Institute of Polar Research Three balloons will be flown from
              the Japanese Antarctic Station, while one payload will be launched from McMurdo
              Station.
