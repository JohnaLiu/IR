Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21). This project is adapting and implementing materials
              and approaches from the ATLAST (Augmenting the Teaching and Learning of Linear
              Algebra through Software Tools) project (DUE-9154149 and DUE-9455074) into two
              first-year courses for prospective mathematics majors, including preservice
              K-12 mathematics teachers. The primary focus is on the incorporation of these
              materials into an introductory course in linear algebra, with a secondary focus
              on the use of specific computer-based modules and materials from ATLAST into a
              course, "Principles of Mathematics," which serves to introduce proofs to future
              mathematics majors.
