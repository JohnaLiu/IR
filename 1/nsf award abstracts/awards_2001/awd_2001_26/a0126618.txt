This project adapts successful models from CSU
              Hayward and James Madison University to facilitate the incorporation of DNA
              sequencing technology into both the undergraduate curriculum and independent
              student research at CSU Chico. We are creating a modern automated DNA
              sequencing facility and integrating sequencing into a wide variety of
              undergraduate courses (microbiology, plant and animal molecular biology,
              systematics and ecology) helping to unify our diverse disciplines.
              Undergraduate students are introduced to modern gene-based biology by
              incorporating hands-on sequencing and database exploration. The project has two
              objectives: (1) to improve undergraduate laboratory course experiences, and (2)
              to stimulate independent student research. We are quantifying class outcomes as
              students' individual and class projects, and independent research by student
              presentations and publications. We are also evaluating how well this project
              helps students prepare for further education or biology-related careers.
