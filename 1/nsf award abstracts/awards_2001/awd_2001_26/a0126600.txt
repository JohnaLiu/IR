Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

The objectives of this collaborative project are
              to improve post-calculus students' learning of probability and statistics and
              to provide students with better preparation for their future careers in
              mathematics and statistics, mathematics education, and computer science. These
              objectives are being achieved by focusing on active and cooperative learning,
              visualization of concepts, and use of simulations in post-calculus introductory
              probability and statistics courses at Athens State University and Middle
              Tennessee State University via the adaptation and implementation of two
              recently developed National Science Foundation funded materials. The materials
              are (a) A Data-Oriented, Active Learning, Post-Calculus Introduction to
              Statistical Concepts, Methods, and Theory (DUE-9950476) and the (b) Virtual
              Laboratories in Probability and Statistics (DUE-9652870). Project activities
              include faculty enhancement at the institutions, the respective institutional
              adaptation and implementation (A&I) of the materials, the evaluation of the A&I
              of the materials, and the assessment of students learning while using the
              materials. The University of Alabama Huntsville is providing the evaluation.
