Abstract    :
              Detachment faults are large-scale extensional structures that are responsible
              for much of the extension observed in the crust, however the origin and
              evolution of detachments are poorly understood and controversial. This project
              will attempt to address the mechanisms and rates of detachment and associated
              basin development in an active modern example - the Cordillera Blanca
              detachment fault in the Peruvian Andes. The work centers on the temporal and
              spatial evolution of the supradetachment basin, the denudation history of the
              uplifted footwall, and the Quaternary kinematic history. Results will be
              incorporated into tectonic models for detachment faulting in
              oceanic-continental convergent settings, which are expected to be of general
              application in this tectonic setting.
