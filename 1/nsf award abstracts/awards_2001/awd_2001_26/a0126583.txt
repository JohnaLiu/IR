Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

Over the past several years, the proliferation of
              accessible mathematics technology has led to alterations in mathematics
              pedagogy. The college has responded to these changes by incorporating the use
              of technology throughout the mathematics curriculum from the use of graphing
              calculators in calculus to computer labs in more advanced classes. The goal of
              such reform has been to provide opportunities for students to work on realistic
              and computationally complex problems, develop strong visualization skills, and
              engage in collaborative and investigative learning. The purpose of this project
              is to extend and fully integrate the use of technology in mathematics classes
              by creating a student-centered computer classroom and implementing appropriate
              curricular changes in the effected courses. Initially, three courses are being
              taught daily in the computer classroom: multivariable calculus, linear algebra,
              and differential equations. These courses already make use of scheduled visits
              to a computer laboratory, but the new classroom is providing daily use of
              essential technologies and eliminating the artificial separation between the
              high-tech and non-tech activities of the class. In order to ensure a successful
              transition to the new space, curricular changes are being implemented that
              reflect the recommendations of The Linear Algebra Curriculum Study Group and
              the Boston University Differential Equations Project.
