              Dinnebeil & Chris Bergin

	The purpose of this conference is to bring
              together key personnel from the major universities and service agencies in
              Northwest Ohio to discuss the feasibility of collaborative research to address
              the needs of children and families.  The conference is specifically targetted
              to achieving consensus for a research agenda and to solidify plans for creating
              a research center. Expected outcomes will be a set of research priorities and
              an implementation plan to move toward establishing research collaboratives and
              possibly a research center on children and families.
