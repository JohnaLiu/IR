The goal of this project is to develop a series of organic
              chemistry/spectroscopy experiments for the general chemistry laboratory that
              use organic chemistry students as peer mentors. Working in groups, the general
              chemistry students work on inquiry experiments that introduce them to
              UV-visible, IR, and NMR spectrometry. Using electronic tools such as e-mail and
              Web-based discussion boards, organic chemistry peer mentor groups collaborate
              on-line with the general chemistry students after the experiments, which helps
              the general chemistry students apply their newly learned knowledge. This
              portion of the project is adapted from the Physical Chemistry On-line project
              (NSF DUE-9950809). Because of the relative simplicity of C-13 spectra, we
              introduce NMR with C-13 rather than proton spectra. An upgrade of our existing
              Varian EM360 with an Anasazi EFT-GENII FT-NMR conversion package provides an
              instrument that allows us to do both proton and C-13 spectra. We also are using
              this spectrometer in our organic chemistry and advanced organic chemistry
              courses, and are adapting experiments from the Journal of Chemical Education
              that allow students to work in groups. The upgraded NMR completes the suite of
              instruments to which we introduce our undergraduate students at an early point
              in their careers. It also allows us to institute a peer-mentoring program,
              which we expect will enhance our students' communication skills and make
              organic chemistry more attractive to students who have finished general
              chemistry. The project serves as a model of how organic chemistry peer mentors
              can be used in general chemistry. We also are developing new experiments that
              introduce NMR to introductory students.
