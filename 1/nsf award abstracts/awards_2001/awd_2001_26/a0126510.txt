Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99)

This project sets up a web-based resource center at
              Alabama State University using adaptations of WeBWork and WWWAssign, to
              strengthen the algebraic and computational skills of students, and to make
              WeBWork and WWWAssign available to regional colleges and high schools. WeBWork
              and WWWAssign are adapted and used in conjunction with other methods to provide
              and collect information through the Internet to offer college mathematics
              homework assignments and college and high school mathematics algebra review and
              practice modules across the web. The project has the following outcomes:
(a)
              WeBWork is adapted in mathematics courses of all levels at our
              institution.
(b) Homework assignments and tests are offered in the resource
              center in electronic form using WeBWork and/or WWWAssign, with automatic
              grading and reporting of scores to instructors and immediate feedback to
              students.
(c) Web-based review materials containing WeBWork practice problem
              sets are written to accompany the assignments and tests so that students who
              encounter difficulties can review and practice the material between attempts.
              
(d) Web-based practice tests are created.
(e) Workshops are conducted and
              assistance is provided for regional postsecondary and secondary teachers
              interested in learning about the WeBWork and WWWAssign systems.
Ongoing
              evaluation and dissemination programs also are fully integrated into the
              project.
