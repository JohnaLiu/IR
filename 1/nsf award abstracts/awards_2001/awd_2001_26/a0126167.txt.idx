Abstract    :
              A three-year research project is proposed with the following goals: 1. To fully
              describe the science and mathematics curricular exposure of high school
              students and differences resulting from curricular variations, social context
              and opportunities to learn, and students background. 2. To analyze how
              curricular exposure and social structure influence students persistence
              through the science and mathematics pipeline. 3. To analyze how curricular
              exposure and academic progress through the science pipeline affect students
              choice to major in science-related fields, including teaching. 4. To analyze
              how science curricular exposure shapes students health behavior and
              health-related science literacy. Three major areas that influence students
              progress through the science and mathematics pipeline and their health choices
              and literacy even if they leave the pipeline are identified and analyzed: (1)
              curriculum content, performance expectations and perspectives (2)
              formal, structured opportunities to learn and (3) the informal social contexts
              of students learning environments. Quantitative methods are employed. This
              study takes advantage of a unique and timely opportunity to analyze nationally
              representative, longitudinal data from the 1990s, the National Longitudinal
              Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) and its transcript supplement. A
              third wave of Add Health is currently being gathered, and students high school
              transcripts and supporting school documents (course catalogues, syllabi,
              textbook lists) are being collected and coded. For this study, course
              curriculum (content, performance expectations, and perspectives) will also be
              coded and analyzed along with the transcript data and longitudinal survey data
              from approximately 19,000 respondents who were in grades 7 through 12 in
              the1994-1995 school year. This data set contains extensive measures of many
              sources of influence from the contexts of students lives that can be linked to
              adolescents health behavior, academic performance, and science and teaching
              aspirations. This study is set within Quadrant III of the ROLE program:
              irResearch on SMET learning in formal and informal educational settings,ll and
              has major implications and links to Quadrants II and IV. The study directly
              targets the question of how recent mathematics and science educational reforms
              in approaches and curriculum materials affect students academic progress and
              learning. It explicitly distinguishes between formal and informal processes to
              assess the effects and interactions of each. The study addresses the
              concentration of Quadrant II since the research questions are framed to
              recognize how the complex, multilevel aspects of students backgrounds and
              lives interact with the structure and social context of schools to affect
              learning. The concentrations of Quadrant IV are also addressed by the
              multilevel approach to analysis of longitudinal, nationally representative
              data. The data sets depth allows for analysis of how reforms in curricular
              content (including textbook adoptions) and structure are related to
              students progress within the context of schools and curriculum-based subsets
              of students (such as tracks). Consistent with common themes across ROLE
              concentration areas, this study will model these processes and analyze
              large-scale effects of curricular and social structuring inherent
              in mathematics and science reform efforts. Finally, it assesses how science
              education is related to the everyday lives of the U.S.s diverse population by
              examining how exposure to science in high school is related to health choices
              and behaviors.
