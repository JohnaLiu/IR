Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59)

This project develops software to automate the
              management of a game simulating the economic decisions in running a company. In
              the game, students apply the principles learned in class to "run their
              company", as investment opportunities become available. Each opportunity
              requires the use of the most recent topics covered in class. The current
              "manual" version of the game, although very popular with the students, requires
              inordinate instructor time to manage the game and calculate the results of the
              students' decisions. Students will be surveyed to get their reaction and their
              suggestions; also test results from students who used the game in their course
              will be compared to those from a similar course where the game was not used.
              The investigators will present papers describing the game and the results of
              their evaluation at professional conferences, and they will make the software
              available free to anyone who is interested through a web site and a CD-ROM.
