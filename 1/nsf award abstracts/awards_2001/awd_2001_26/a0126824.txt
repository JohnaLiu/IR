Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
This project is developing a new long-term
              experimental site that will serve as a focus for undergraduate ecology at East
              Carolina University (ECU). The ecology laboratory required for biology majors
              has been based on a series of outdated "cookbook" experiments and field trips,
              and lacked opportunities for investigative learning. We are developing a course
              that has relevance and value for all biology students at ECU, the majority of
              whom will pursue careers in health or biotechnology. We are modeling our
              project after a successful project at Southern Illinois University, and taking
              advantage of ECU's recent acquisition of 600 acres of land near campus. The
              project has three educational objectives: 1) to enhance learning of
              ecological
concepts; 2) to teach skills in data management and analysis; and
              3) to promote an understanding of ecological principles that will inform
              students as future citizens. The sites illustrate important processes in
              community ecology that can be observed only on a long time scale. The
              accumulation of a valuable long-term data set will provide a wealth of
              opportunities for students to explore tools for data management and
              interpretation. We are working with the students to present and publish the
              data, and develop a nationally accessible website for the project (linked to
              the ESA website). Once the sites are established, we will encourage other ECU
              faculty, other North Carolina universities, and local K-12 schools to
              participate in the project.
