Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the University of California at Irvine will
              purchase a Beowulf cluster of 32 (16 dual) Intel Pentium CPUs (connected with
              1Gbic ethernet and operated by Linux) together with a SGI graphics computer. 
              The computer equipment will be dedicated as a powerful distributed computing
              resource to the support of research in the mathematical sciences involving
              numerical studies of partial differential equations.  This broad area of
              research will include in particular the following projects:  Microstructure
              evolution in a three-dimensional elastic system - Q. Nie and F. Wan Numerical
              study of surface diffusion in three dimensions - H. Zhao Computational study
              of the Navier-Stokes-alpha model - Q. Nie, K. Solna and E. Titi Computaiton of
              harmonic maps - P. Li Numerical studies for the Gauss curvature flow with flat
              sides - P. Daskalopoulos and R. Hamilton  In addition to new understanding
              for the problems in material sciences, fluid mechanics and geometry
              investigated, the results of these studies will provide important computational
              tools for many other important problems in science and engineering that require
              large scale computation
