Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Slovak project between William Bowman of the University of Colorado,
              Boulder, and Lubos Halada of the Institute of Landscape Ecology, Slovak Academy
              of Sciences, compares the responses of two alpine sites that differ in their
              rates and the temporal extent of nitrogen deposition due to pollution and
              nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization. The US site is at Niwot Ridge in
              the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains and the Slovak site is in the
              Western Tatra Mountains, near Mt. Salatin.  The goal is to assess ecosystem
              responses over long periods to contrasting levels of chronic atmospheric
              nitrogen deposition, which historically have been very high in Europe and
              relatively low in the Rockies.
 
The U.S. and Slovak teams will collaborate
              on experimental approaches to examining plant-soil feedback and on assessing
              the impact of environmental change on ecosystem function.  Specifically they
              intend to examine: 1) the response to N and P fertilization of alpine
              vegetation which received high rates of N deposition for several decades; 2)
              the importance of plant species composition and abundance to N retention in the
              alpine soils, and 3) the degree to which changes in the plant species
              composition has occurred over the past one and two decades.  Results should
              improve our basic knowledge of alpine systems where the ratio of N deposition
              to plant biomass is high relative to other ecosystems.  If successful, the
              project also may lead to better global predictions of the consequences from
              available nitrogen.   

This ecological research project fulfills the program
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United
              States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
