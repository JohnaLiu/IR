Abstract    :
              Abstract:

A  3-day workshop on fracture toughness test standardization
              for
concrete is planned. It is now imperative that experts meet to select a
              single
standard. The purpose of the workshop is to study a number of fracture
              toughness test
proposals, and to select a proposal to recommend to American
              Society for
Testing of Materials for adoption. We will invite 15 researchers
              from around
the world, and will make every effort to include qualified women
              and
minorities.
