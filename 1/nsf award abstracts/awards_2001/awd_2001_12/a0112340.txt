Abstract    :
              The Institute of Statistics and Decision Sciences (ISDS) at Duke
University
              will purchase high-speed computing equipment to be
dedicated to support of
              several linked projects in statistical and
computational methodology for
              bioinformatics. Specific research
projects involve stochastic modeling of
              biomolecular sequence and
structure, models and computation for large-scale
              functional
genomics, and statistical modeling for gene characterization
              studies.
The grant will provide high-throughput networking equipment,
              high-speed 
numerical servers, a file server, and a high-throughput ethernet
              switch 
and connectors. This equipment, together with desktop machines
              providing
platforms for local, non-numerically intensive computations, will
              provide
a numerical/file server cluster for the three faculty
              investigators,
post-doctoral associates and graduate students working on the
              proposed
bioinformatics projects.
