Physical characterization of turbulent
              flow with suspended particles has remained a challenge requiring much effort in
              both direct computational analysis as well as accurate high resolution
              measurements.  The holographic particle image velocimetry (HPIV) technique has
              been applied effectively for investigation and characterization of single phase
              flows seeded with tracer particles (small Stokes number).  Extension of this
              method to particle-laden flows for 'high-resolution' characterization of the
              behavior of the carrier fluid as well as characterization of the suspended
              particles (with large Stokes number) and particle dynamics has remained a
              challenge.

This proposal makes use of the unique HPIV facilities developed
              by the PI at the host institution in an attempt to develop an extended HPIV
              technique for full characterization of the particle-laden turbulent flow.  If
              successful, the approach is particularly effective since the measurements can
              be at the spatial resolution comparable to the resolution in direct numerical
              simulations (DNS).  This will allow direct comparison with DNS results, as well
              as complement the more engineering based models and large eddy simulations.
