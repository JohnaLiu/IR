Abstract    :
              Working poverty - arising when a job fails to bring an employee's income above
              the poverty line - is a growing phenomenon in southern California and in the
              United States, but has received little attention by urban researchers. 
              Building on existing research on welfare, labor markets, and urban economic
              development, and ongoing work on the geography of poverty and fiscal
              disparities (see previous NSF project #9905866), this study investigates the
              relationship between the intrametropolitan patterns of economic activity and
              working poverty, and estimates the fiscal impact on local jurisdictions in the
              context of southern California.  More specifically, the investigators consider
              the extent to which the gap between a "livable" income and the sub-poverty
              income of the working poor imposes extra costs on local governments in the form
              of traditional anti-poverty expenditures as well as additional services such as
              childcare, transportation, training, job information, and work-related
              healthcare - costs that may only be partly offset by intergovernmental
              transfers or expenditures.  To empirically test these relationships, the
              investigators will develop a model of the impact of working poverty on local
              public finance and the role of the intrametropolitan division of labor on this
              relationship during the 1980s and 1990s - a period of dramatic changes in
              fiscal federalism, welfare organization, labor market conditions and
              immigration. First, they will measure the incidence of working poverty, analyze
              its demographic characteristics, identify the industries and occupations where
              it prevails, and estimate its geographical distribution across municipalities
              in the five-county southern California region.  Second, they will calculate the
              gap between the actual wages of the working poor and a "livable" wage required
              to avoid poverty for each city.  Third, they will estimate the impact of this
              gap on local antipoverty expenditures, taking into account the role of fiscal
              disparities, local labor market characteristics, business subsidies, living
              wage ordinances, proportion of immigrants, and welfare-to-work factors.  This
              last step will make use of multivariate regression analyses.  This study
              addresses important questions that have not been systematically approached by
              urban geographers and other scholars of poverty.  First, it provides a better
              understanding of who the working poor are and emphasizes the links between
              working poverty and the regional economy.  Furthermore, it provides a valuable
              tool for analyzing the social, political and spatial implications of working
              poverty, including heightened economic and social polarization, continued
              central city deterioration, and rapid exurbanization.  A better understanding
              of these issues is critical to the development of successful antipoverty
              policies both at the national and local levels.
