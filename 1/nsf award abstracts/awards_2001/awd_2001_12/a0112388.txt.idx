Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the University of California, SantaBarbara
              will purchase a Beowulf Cluster consisting of 16 dual processornode, one
              single processor controlling node, a network switch, backup tapedrive, and a
              rack. This hardware will be dedicated to the support ofresearch in the
              mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used forseveral research
              projects, including in particular:  Computations ofscaling of fluvial
              landscapes, computations of effectively nonlinearquantum systems, dynamically
              adaptive and nonstiff boundary integralmethods, numerical schemes for
              simulations of multi-phase fluids andvorticity deformation in 2D ideal
              incompressible fluid flow.
