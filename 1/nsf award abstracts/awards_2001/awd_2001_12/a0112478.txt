Abstract    :
              During the austral spring, diatom species and the colonial prymnesiophyte
              Phaeocystis antarctica form large blooms in the Ross Sea.  The diatom blooms
              are typically localized in the western Ross Sea while the P. antarctica blooms
              typically develop in the southeastern and south central regions of the Ross
              Sea.  Recent data suggest that the dominance of non-siliceous phytoplankton
              organisms, such as P. antarctica may be responsible for the drawdown in
              atmospheric CO2 that occurred during the last glacial maximum.  The proposed
              project would focus on developing a new method to test whether the algal
              sterol, brassicasterol, could be a useful sediment biomarker for delineating
              the relative abundance of P. antarctica in over-lying waters.  Sediment samples
              from each of these regions will be analyzed to test whether a compound-specific
              d13C method could be used to determine the relative abundance of Phaeocystis
              antarctica from over-lying waters.  Specifically, laboratory cultures and core
              materials would be used to look for a depleted d13C sediment brassicasterol
              signal.  If the method proves valid in the Ross Sea, then it could provide some
              definitive answers regarding the potential role of P. antarctica during the
              glacial/interglacial boundary.  Positive results would be potentially important
              to a diverse array of scientists including: biogeochemists, biological
              oceanographers, paleoceanographers, and global climate modelers.
