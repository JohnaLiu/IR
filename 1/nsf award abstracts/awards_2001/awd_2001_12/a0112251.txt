This Americas Program award will support the "Second
              International Workshop on Iron and Copper Homeostasis", to be held in Pucon,
              Chile.  Organized by Dr. Michael D. Garrick of SUNY in collaboration with Dr.
              Marco T. Nunez of the University of Chile,  
the objective of this workshop is
              to strengthen international scientific collaboration in research on iron and
              copper metabolism, and to stimulate the interest of young scientists and
              students in an area highly relevant to the understanding of toxicology, health
              and disease states.  

Iron and copper metabolisms are intimately
              intertwined: systemic copper deficiency generates cellular iron deficiency,
              which in humans results in diminished work capacity, reduced intellectual
              capacity, diminished growth, alterations in bone mineralization, diminished
              immune response and other symptoms.  This workshop will try to provide a better
              understanding of iron and copper metabolisms and particularly of their
              interactions.

This proposed workshop will convene leading scientists in the
              fields of iron and copper metabolism from North America, South America, Europe,
              Israel and Japan, to exchange knowledge, and to establish future avenues of
              collaborative research.
