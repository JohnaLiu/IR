This grant supports an upgrade to the seismological computing
              capability and enhancements to our ability to process and interpret
              environmental geophysical data at the University of Texas at El Paso.  The
              equipment will be used primarily to interrogate huge volumes of seismic data
              from refraction and reflection data sets and to run seismic tomography and
              waveform modeling codes including full waveform finite difference simulations. 
              To accommodate these needs we will use grant funds to purchase a multi-CPU Unix
              server with enough computing capacity for these tasks, as well as two PCs that
              will be dedicated to environmental geophysics projects.  The new computers will
              replace outdated equipment.  These computing facilities will support the
              research of PI, Kate Miller, and Co-Pis, G. Randy Keller, Diane Doser, Steve
              Harder, and ca. 20 graduate and undergraduate students.
