Abstract    :
              This research program will continue and complete an experimental investigation
              of the radiative properties of high temperature combustion gases, particularly
              CO2 and H2O. Existing property data for these gases have an average uncertainty
              of plus/minus 30% and may be in error in some cases by as much as 70%.  The PI
              will use a unique isothermal high-temperature gas column and an FTIR
              spectrometer to ensure better spectral resolution than previous high
              temperature measurements.  The potential impact is a significantly improved
              capability to make radiative heat transfer calculations in arbitrary combustion
              gas/particulate environments, including combustion chambers and furnaces,
              fires, and propulsion systems, and therefore improve the performance and design
              of these systems.
