Abstract    :
              Motility and chemotaxis functions are not only complex behaviors in Bacillus
              subtilis important to cell survival in nutrient deprived and toxic
              environments, but require multi-level regulation of the cognate genes. However,
              additional strategies for survival, including sporulation, exist, and the
              elaboration of the structures required for motility is biosynthetically costly
              to the cell. Therefore, flagellar gene expression in B. subtilis must be
              sensitive to the global state of the cell. On-going research in this laboratory
              is dedicated to understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms that monitor
              the nutritional state of the cell and control flagellar gene expression.
              Another means of conserving biosynthetic energy is by structural regulation of
              the flagellin gene that encodes the main component of the flagellar filament by
              FlgM. FlgM is an anti-sigma factor that inhibits flagellin gene expression
              until the multi-protein structure that tethers the filament is functionally
              assembled. The molecular nature of this control, as well as the mechanism that
              allows for FlgM inhibition by a bacterial structure, has not been determined in
              B. subtlis. Therefore, this project is focused on defining the specifics of
              FlgM control, and of its morphogenetic regulation. This work promises to
              provide insight into nutritional and structural regulation of an important
              bacterial behavior. Further, these studies are an important part of the
              educational activities in the Biology department at San Francisco State
              University and will benefit the training of undergraduate and masters degree 
              students, many of whom are members of underrepresented minority groups in
              science.
