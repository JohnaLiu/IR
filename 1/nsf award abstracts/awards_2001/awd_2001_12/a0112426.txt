Abstract    :
              This program produces a cadre of computer scientists with strong specializations
              in information assurance and a commitment to federal service. Three cohorts of
              students complete a two-year program that integrates intense information
              assurance studies with research and outreach. Students also spend one summer as
              interns in federal agencies. Upon completion of degrees at the end of two years
              the students then enter the federal cyber service. The program features an
              emphasis on collaborative research and outreach to the community. The program
              components train students in information assurance theory and practice while
              providing an environment that fosters teamwork, strengthens motivation, and
              builds a sense of professionalism and commitment to service.
