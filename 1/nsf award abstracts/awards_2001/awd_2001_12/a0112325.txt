An opportunity exists for a Sea Grant Fellow to participate in
              the development of new
and revised management plans to protect both marine and
              terrestrial areas in Antarctica
which have been designated for their unique
              scientific values. Guidelines exist to assist
in the process, but the Fellow
              would be responsible for developing a finished draft plan.
Additional
              responsibilities would involve assistance in coordinating with
              international
organizations involved in the review of the plans to ensure that
              the concerns of other
Antarctic Treaty parties had been taken into account
              before the final plans were presented
at an Antarctic Treaty Consultative
              meeting for approval.
