Abstract    :
              Through a case study of the recent, rapid development of Arizona's correctional
              system, this study explores the contours, impacts, and practical operations of
              a state penal system that has largely developed in the post--rehabilitative age
              of prison policy. This research address two distinct but related questions: 1)
              Whether the nature of the state's penal policies is influenced by the state's
              developmental history, including economic activity, political responses to
              crime, and attitudes toward punishment and crime; and 2) What impact penal
              policies have on contemporary prisons and prisoners, including an assessment of
              various qualities of imprisonment in the state.  To explore the first question,
              the principal investigator will use both quantitative and qualitative analyses
              of secondary data and primary archival materials related to the development and
              rapid expansion of Arizona's prison system over the past 50 years. The second
              component of the project utilizes ethnographic field observation methods and
              in-depth interviews to explore the contemporary state of imprisonment in
              Arizona.
