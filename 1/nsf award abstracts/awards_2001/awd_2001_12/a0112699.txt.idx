Abstract    :
              Despite high levels of inequality in home ownership across races, ethnic groups,
              and neighborhoods in the United States, recent trends among minorities and
              low-income groups reveal record high levels of home ownership.  In aiming to
              understand this development, this project examines how the race and income of
              both individuals and neighborhoods affect home mortgage lending to underserved
              neighborhoods over the last decade.  It also gives special attention to the
              institutional factors responsible for changes in lending and the ability of
              minority and low-income groups to purchase homes.  On one hand, banking
              deregulation may have increased competition in ways that serve all income
              groups, and new performance guidelines under the Community Reinvestment Act may
              have prompted lenders covered by the law to do more for underserved markets. 
              On the other hand, institutional factors may have had less positive effects: 
              the rapid changes in the home mortgage lending industry may have resulted in
              the use of less favorable loan terms, inadequate consumer protection, and
              financing of poor quality housing.   To address these issues, this project
              analyzes the consequences of institutional changes in home mortgage lending
              using nation-wide data from 1992-2001 from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. 
              It measures characteristics of the mortgage applicants and lenders, the
              requested loan amount and the outcome of the request, and the census
              characteristics of the neighborhood of the housing.  The analysis then
              describes changes over time in the loans made to minority and low-income
              groups, and in the determinants of the decision to deny a loan application.  By
              extending the previous work of the investigator on Indiana to the nation as a
              whole, and using an under-studied data source, the project contributes to our
              understanding of how housing inequality emerges and has changed in recent
              years.
