Abstract    :
              Modern computation methods (parallel computing and object oriented programming)
              will be used to develop a plasma simulation code, which will be made freely
              available. A scheme for domain decomposition is planned which permits nearly
              arbitrary load balancing. The code will be used to simulate three dimensional
              problems in advanced acceleration via laser-plasma interactions.
