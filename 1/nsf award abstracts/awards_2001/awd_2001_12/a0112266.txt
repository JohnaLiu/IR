This grant provides partial support for acquisition of EBSD
              hardware and software for microstructural observations of deformed rocks.  The
              EBSD will be installed on a SEM at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in
              Woods Hole, MA.  The PI, Greg Hirth, is a tenured Associate Scientist at the
              Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI).  The EBSD facility will be
              available to a diverse range of research projects being pursued by scientists
              in the Woods Hole community.  The EBSD is now becoming a powerful phase
              identification tool.  This capability will be particularly useful for
              petrologists and geochemists at WHOI that analyze fine-grained experimental
              charges and fine-grained metamorphic assemblages produced during hydrothermal
              processes in the oceanic crust.  The EBSD also has important applications for
              geomicrobiologists (the analysis of crystallographic control on the attachment
              of microbial material to mineral surfaces) and scientists studying global
              climate change (the identification of daily growth regions in corals). 
              Finally, education opportunities for applications of EBSD, which would be
              installed on an SEM at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), will be enhanced
              by the microscopy short courses held each summer at the MBL.  Support for this
              grant is shared between the Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities
              Program (EAR/IF), and the Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE).
