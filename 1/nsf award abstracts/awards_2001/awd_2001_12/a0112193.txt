The International Symposium on Metastable, Mechanically
              Alloyed and Nanocrystalline Materials (ISMANAM 2001) will be held at the
              University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, during 24-29 June 2001.
              Nanostructured materials (e.g., nanocrystals or nanoparticles) as well as
              amorphous and other metastable materials will be covered. Both fundamental
              issues and applications will be addressed. As a forum for novel ideas, the
              symposium is intended to promote contact between basic research and
              technological needs for industrial applications. The program will include
              invited and keynote lectures by internationally distinguished scientists as
              well as contributed papers, in either oral or poster presentations. The
              symposium proceedings will be published in the journal "Materials Science
              Forum."  The symposium Web site (http://www.ners.engin.umich.edu/ISMANAM2001)
              has further details about the symposium.

Research on nanostructured
              materials and amorphous and other metastable materials has increased as
              opportunities arise for industrial applications of these unusual
              materials.
