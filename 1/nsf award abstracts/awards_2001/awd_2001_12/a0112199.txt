Support is provided for a multi-disciplinary workshop to
              identify important areas of research in tribology that involve biological,
              biomedical, and medical issues. This workshop willhave principal goals of
              providing an overview of the current state of the art and recommending new
              directions of research. The workshop will have approximately 40 to 50
              participants, and feature several keynote speakers and participants from
              tribology, medicine, the biomedical implant community, and biology. The 2.5 day
              long
workshop's format will consist of the following:
 Introductory session

              Presentations by keynote speakers
 Posters by attendees
 Breakout sessions

              Final half day wrap up session
The workshop results will be documented to
              provide valuable guidance for future research directions in tribology. Results
              of the workshop will be released into the public domain by the workshop
              organizing committee, as a report to NSF, and as an article to be submitted to
              one of the Tribology and Biomedical Engineering periodicals and as web-based
              documents.  Special efforts will bemade to facilitate communication between the
              various scientific communities involved and to identify areas for future
              cross-disciplinary research.  Special efforts will also be made to bring new
              researchers and graduate students to the meeting and to attract attendeed from
              underrepresented groups.
