Abstract    :
              The Mutator  system is a highly mutagenic family of transposable elements in
              maize. Mutator transposition is regulated by the MuDR class of transposons. 
              MuDR elements encode two genes:  mudrA and mudrB.  The mudrA gene is the
              putative transposase.  Although known to be a necessary component of Mu
              activity, the biochemical function of the mudrB gene is not known.  The primary
              objective of this research is to elucidate the evolution and function of this
              gene. The mudrA gene is much more widely distributed among grasses than mudrB. 
              Based on this, and the absence of mudrB in many apparently functional MuDR-like
              elements,  it is hypothesized that mudrB was captured by MuDR at some point
              during the evolution of this transposon.  To test this hypothesis,  several
              grasses related to maize will be surveyed for the presence and composition of
              mudrB sequences.  To investigate the function of mudrB in maize, existing
              derivatives that express only mudrA or only mudrB will be exploited. 
              Experiments in which these two deletion derivatives will be combined
              genetically will test the hypothesis that the two can compliment each other. 
              In addition, the derivative that lacks mudrB will be crossed to mutations that
              affect Mutator activity.  In order to determine if mudrB can contribute to high
              levels of MuDR transposition in a species that lacks this gene, rice will be
              transformed with constitutively and inducibly expressed mudrB.  Proteomic
              analysis of proteins binding Mu element TIRs will be employed to identify
              proteins involved in regulating Mu element transposition in the presence and
              absence of mudrA or mudrB and in the presence of mutations that affect Mutator
              activity.  Proteomic analysis of binding of Mu termini from these mutations
              will also serve to identify other proteins that operate in the same pathway as
              the mutations that affect activity.
