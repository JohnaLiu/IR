Abstract    :
              The proposed work focuses on development of modular adaptable software for
              vision-based human-computer interaction. The key idea is to use local visual
              interaction cues on a video stream  - mono or stereo, 2D or 3D - shared between
              the user and computer.  The use of such cues has a number of advantages, such
              as limiting the processing to only those parts of the image where interaction
              takes place,  allowing image processing to be dynamically driven by the
              interaction,  and an easily parameterized  modular basis for software
              development. Questions of how visual interaction cues can be flexibly defined
              and robustly detected based on local informaiton will be explored.
