Abstract    :
              Funding is provided for a seismic and structural geology experiment to delineate
              the geometries and patterns of crustal extension and rift magmatism along three
              main conjugate margins across Alarcon, Guaymas and Delfin Basins (to study the
              south to north seafloor-spreading to non-spreading mode) and a E-W profile
              along Wagner Basin (to study the low-angle detachment fault at depth). The
              questions to be addressed include, strain partitioning, volumetric and
              emplacement style of rift magmatism, along-axis differences in extension style
              and the influence of sedimentation on deformation. An integrated land-based and
              at sea study is planned for the next three years.
