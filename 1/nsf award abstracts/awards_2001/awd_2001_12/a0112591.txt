Abstract

Reliable and
              seamless wireless connectivity in varied environments is a necessary
              requirement for the rich and diverse communications of the future. Space-time
              processing has emerged as a key enabling technology for future wireless
              communications: signal space dimensions are fundamental to reliable
              communication and antenna arrays augment the traditional dimensions of time and
              frequency with the spatial dimension. While recent theoretical and
              technological advances provide a tremendous boon for modern communications, the
              state-of-the-art is far from realizing the full potential of space-time
              processing due to significant gaps in our current understanding on two
              fronts:

Fundamental mechanisms underlying the interaction of the space-time
              channel with the signal space in spatial, temporal, and spectral
              dimensions.

Jointly optimized design of front-end hardware, antenna arrays,
              and signal processing algo-rithms.  

The overall goal of the work proposed
              here is an integrated approach to the design of antenna array hardware and
              space-time processing algorithms for significantly improved wireless link
              performance
at reduced cost and complexity.
