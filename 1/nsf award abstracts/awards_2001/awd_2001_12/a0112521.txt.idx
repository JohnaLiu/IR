Abstract    :
              This award continues NSF support for the core activities of the Committee on
              National Statistics (CNSTAT), a standing committee of the National Academy of
              Sciences-National Research Council (NAS-NRC).  The committee works to improve,
              over the long term, the statistical methods and information on which public
              policy decisions are based.  It strengthens, directly and indirectly, the
              development of data for social, behavioral, and economic science research,
              makes such data more accessible for research, and furthers the development of
              methods for measurement, collection, and analysis for research and other
              purposes.  On its own initiative, or at the request of NSF or another agency,
              the committee will identify problem areas in which statistical questions are
              important to public policy and carry out studies within these areas by itself
              or by convening panels of other experts.  Most of the Committee's studies will
              fall under three major themes:  improving and furthering the development of
              data on social and economic conditions, including health, social welfare, and
              the environment; improving statistical methods and their applications; and
              integrating and coordinating national statistics.  The Committee will select
              specific areas for study, develop expert panels or workshops, select
              participants, review study activities and reports, and widely disseminate study
              results that have been rigorously peer reviewed under NAS
              oversight.  Established in 1972 at the recommendation of the President's
              Commission on Federal Statistics, the committee fills a critical gap as an
              integrative force for a highly decentralized federal statistical system, in
              which research interests often have lower priority than other concerns. 
              Representing more than a series of research studies, the committee's work also
              is a unique process of intellectual development that is critical in a
              decentralized statistical system.  The committee provides leadership over
              interdisciplinary areas by bringing methodologically oriented statisticians and
              quantitatively oriented social, behavioral, economic, and physical scientists
              together with federal agency staff to work on problems important to public
              policy.  The committee will continue to (1) improve national statistics and
              further the development and application of statistical methods for research,
              (2) link the science research communities and federal agencies that depend on
              scientific methods, (3) involve academic scientists in research to improve
              statistics that are used and produced in the federal government, and (4)
              provide forums for the exchange of information and ideas.
