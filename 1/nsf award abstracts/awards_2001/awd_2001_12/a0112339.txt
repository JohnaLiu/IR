This grant provides partial support to the Department of
              Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of New Mexico (UNM) for the
              acquisition of a new electron microprobe (EMP) for petrologic and cosmochemical
              research.  A companion proposal submitted concurrently to NASA's Cosmochemistry
              program will also be funded and together with UNM matching funds, will allow
              the department to purchase a state-of-the-art EMP with five wavelength
              dispersive spectrometers and light element analytical capabilities.  The new
              EMP will replace an aging JEOL 733 Superprobe (vintage '83) and will be
              maintained within the Electron Microbeam Analysis Facility at UNM which also
              houses a modern SEM and TEM and is staffed by a full time research associate
              with expertise in electron microscopy.  The instrument will support a wide
              range of research programs within the department and in collaboration with
              nearby scientists from Sandia National Laboratory including petrologic studies
              of high pressure mantle phases, investigations of the Precambrian tectonics of
              the southwest U.S., low temperature geochemistry and petrologic investigations
              of meteorites.  The instrument will also support a large and active graduate
              student population.
