Abstract    :
              Thomas Beck of the University of Cincinnati is supported by the Division of
              Chemistry through the Information and Technology Research (ITR) program.  He
              will develop multiscale algorithms for density functional theory, and apply
              them to computations of current-voltage curves for a range of prototype organic
              molecules which have been proposed for realistic device applications.

The
              computing revolution of the last twenty years has been driven by the continued
              miniaturization of electronic components.  Therefore it is of great interest to
              develop molecular computing devices.  In this research, electron transport in
              synthetic organic molecules proposed as prototype molecular wires will be
              investigated via accurate quantum chemical calculations.
