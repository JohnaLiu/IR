Abstract    :
              This project involves research to enable musical tele-presence employing high
              performance communication networks and audio-video immersive environments.  The
              goal is to create the impression of "being in the same room" for geographically
              separated users offering complete and immediate two-way visual and auditory
              contact to enable two or more musicians at different locations to freely
              interact musically.   Three linked "tele-presence" studios being developed at
              the University of Rochester will be employed to understand the sources and
              effects of latency in musical interactions arising from acoustic, electronic
              and network factors under two-way real-time links.   The controlled links
              between the studios will allow for gradated stages between the controlled
              situation of a dedicated local network to the more congested state of the
              Internet2 and the wider Internet.   Building upon existing research, the limits
              of tolerance for latency in musical situations will be explored for various
              available network protocols, important Quality of Service issues and tradeoffs
              found in each will be investigated, and fault tolerant data transmission
              applications that employ data interleaving will be developed.   Resources of
              the University of Rochester's Eastman School of Music will help guide this
              development from the end-user perspective.    Ultimately the development of
              musical tele-presence will create an infrastructure through which music lessons
              and master classes by the best instructors can be simulcast in an interactive
              way.    Performers could rehearse, perform and record together over the
              Internet, and chamber music groups could form unencumbered by geographical
              distances.
