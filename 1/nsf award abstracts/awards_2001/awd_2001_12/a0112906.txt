Abstract    :
              In recent years, auction theory has been asked to provide guidance
              to
policymakers in several important areas, including spectrum
              auctions,
electricity auctions, and Treasury auctions. Unfortunately, the
              received
theory had largely focused on auctions of a single object, and so had
              little
to rigorously say about the most empirically relevant auction
              problems.
Recent research by economists has begun to expand the boundaries of
              auction
theory and analysis so as to encompass multiple-item auctions. In
              prior
work, we have analyzed the theoretical properties of existing
              multiple-item
auction formats, proposed new efficient auction formats for
              multiple items,
proposed new applications for multiple-item auctions, and
              empirically
evaluated recent applications of auctions for spectrum and
              electricity. This
project builds upon this recent work, by examining the
              following topics:
* Development of the properties of a new, efficient
              ascending auction for
heterogeneous commodities.
* Understanding the
              theoretical underpinnings for efficient ascending
auctions.
* Analysis of
              auctions for heterogeneous commodities in environments with
interdependent
              values.
* Study of auction theory with agency problems.
* Use of the reserve
              price in mitigating the exercise of market power.
* New applications for
              multiple-item auction designs.
* Empirical analysis of the European 3G
              spectrum auctions.
The project includes a balance between further theoretical
              developments of
multiple-item auctions, and practical applications and
              empirical testing of
the ideas of auction theory.
