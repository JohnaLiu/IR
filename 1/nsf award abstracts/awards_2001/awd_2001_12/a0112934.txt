Title:
              ITR/AP(BIO): Algorithmic Study in Computational Proteomics

The main focus of
              this project is on developing computer algorithms and programs to support a
              technology called High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)-Tandem Mass
              Spectrometry (MS-MS), a very powerful tool for high-throughput protein
              identification. This technology generates mass patterns for peptides, and
              relies on fast and accurate computer algorithms to map mass patterns to peptide
              sequences. This project aims at designing algorithms for multiple proteomic
              applications.

	This project addresses four fundamental computational problem
              areas in Proteomics: (1) the problem of peptide identification (2) the problem
              of de novo peptide sequencing, which aims to sequence peptides directly from
              tandem mass spectra without database search, (3) the problem of identifying
              protein cross-linking sites, which looks for a pair of cross-linked peptide
              sequences optimally correlated to a tandem mass spectrum, and (4) the problem
              of peptide mass fingerprinting, which aims to identify proteins by their masses
              of enzyme-digested peptide mass patterns. Novel and efficient algorithms are
              being designed to solve these problems.
