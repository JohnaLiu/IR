Abstract    :
              This award is for an analysis of poll data and attempts to determine how much
              campaigns actually influence voters and how long the effects persist.  In
              particular, researchers analyze how variables, such as party identification,
              grow and recede in importance as the campaign evolves.  Using applied
              statistical procedures, the researchers investigate this question at both the
              aggregate and individual level.  At the aggregate level they analyze
              state-level poll data for the President and other offices as well as national
              data for Congressional office.  For the individual level, they analyze
              presidential preference surveys from at least every month of each election year
              from 1952 to 2000.
