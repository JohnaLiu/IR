Abstract    :
              The Japanese Speech Style Shift Symposium will bring together approximately 20
              leading scholars from linguistics, sociology, and anthropology who are doing
              groundbreaking work on in style 'shifting' in naturally occurring interactions
              in Japanese. The participants, who come from a variety of leading institutions
              in the United States and abroad, are a combination of prominent researchers in
              this area and younger scholars who are likely to have a major impact on this
              rapidly-growing field in the near future. The participants will present papers
              which have been pre-circulated. This will allow for a relatively lengthy and
              detailed discussion of each paper. There will also be a workshop devoted to
              examining and discussing a pre-circulated set of data. Specific goals for the
              symposium are 1) to determine what varieties of language tend to be used for
              style shifting and how pervasive the phenomenon of style shifting is, 2) to
              identify reasons for speech style shifts, 3) to improve our awareness of what
              the various disciplines represented at the symposium have to offer the study of
              style shifting, 4) to explore the implications speech style shifts have for our
              understanding of the nature of grammar, interaction, and social organization,
              and 5) to seek the implications our resulting understanding of style shifting
              has for the learning and teaching of the Japanese language. The results of the
              symposium will be published as an edited volume.
