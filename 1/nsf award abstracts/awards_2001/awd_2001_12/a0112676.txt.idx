Abstract    :

              University    The PIs will study variation in the career patterns of a late
              1970s cohort of low skilled workers by examining the impact of ethnicity and
              locality on these workers' careers.  The PI will focus on spatial variation in
              income inequality, local demand for labor overall and low skill labor in
              particular, and local variation in race/ethnic inequality to explain the career
              dynamics of low skill workers. A prominent explanation for rising race/ethnic
              inequality is the spatial mismatch hypothesis that points toward the spatial
              location of African Americans and whites relative to the location and skill
              requirements of available jobs. There are also well documented spatial
              variations in the degree of race/ethnic competition, segregation, and
              discrimination. Therefore, it is expected that the prospects of low skilled
              workers are strongly tied to both their race/ethnicity and their opportunities
              in local labor markets. The investigators will develop a model of career
              inequality, which focuses on the endogenous creation of human capital
              disparities across the career.  How do local labor market opportunities and
              local race/ethnic inequality shape the cumulative labor market experiences and
              earnings of low skilled workers?  The investigators will develop tentative
              answers to this question using the National Longitudinal Survey - Youth Sample.
               The analytic strategy is to use three-level hierarchical linear models. In
              these models person-year outcomes and human capital attributes are at level
              one, fixed individual characteristics such as race, ethnicity, or gender are at
              level two, and characteristics of the local labor market are at level
              three.  The research seeks to make two two key scientific advances. The first
              is the explicit conceptualization of human capital acquisition as endogenous to
              the labor market and so consistent with contextualized accounts of labor market
              opportunity and discrimination. The second is the implementation of a
              statistical framework, which assumes that the context of decisions and
              behaviors is important, and that fixed individual attributes and attributes of
              localities are the interactional context of human capital acquisition and
              returns.
