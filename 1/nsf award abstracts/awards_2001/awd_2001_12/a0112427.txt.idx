Abstract    :
              A growing body of research has identified the important role of shame and guilt
              in regulating human social behavior. Past research has discovered that shame
              and guilt are often evoked by similar circumstances, yet these emotions are
              clearly distinct. For example, whereas guilt appears to facilitate smoother
              social interactions and psychological adjustment, shame prompts feelings of
              self-consciousness and a desire to withdraw from social encounters. Although
              existing research on shame and guilt has focused on the experience of these
              emotions as it occurs after people have committed a blameworthy action
              themselves, almost no research has examined factors that predict when people
              experience shame or guilt for actions carried out by other individuals. The
              proposed research will test a model of vicarious shame and guilt that
              integrates current understandings of self-conscious emotion with theoretical
              perspectives on social associations to predict what types of associations make
              individuals susceptible to vicarious shame versus guilt for the actions of
              others. The perceived essentiality of one's association to a wrongdoer is
              predicted to intensify reactions of vicarious shame and distancing responses,
              whereas one's level of interpersonal interdependence with a wrongdoer is
              predicted to intensify reactions of vicarious guilt and efforts to repair any
              damage done to a victim. A series of 14 experiments will manipulate the type of
              association participants have to an individual who commits a wrongdoing and
              examine the effects of these manipulations on participants' self-reported
              emotional reactions and cognitive appraisals, as well as their behavioral
              responses to both the wrongdoer and the victim. Because shame and guilt evoke
              such different behavioral reactions to events, the proposed research on
              vicarious shame and guilt promises to yield insights important for theories of
              intergroup and interpersonal behavior, as well as for theories of emotion.
