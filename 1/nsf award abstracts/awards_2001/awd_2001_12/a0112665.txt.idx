Abstract    :
              This research applies networks of sensors and control devices to enhance the
              performance of civil infrastructure systems, particularly utility lifeline
              systems, under both emergency and daily operational conditions.  Specific
              objectives of this research are to: 1) develop a conceptual system design
              capable of data acquisition, wireless data transmission, data
              processing/analysis and operational control of a water delivery system;  2)
              develop innovative neural network-based inverse analysis algorithms and
              software to determine in near real-time the extent and locations of damage or
              malfunction sustained by system components such as pipe segments, pipe joints,
              pumping stations, etc., and 3)  use  Memphis Light, Gas and Water (MLGW)
              Division's water system for a pilot case study to demonstrate the improvements
              offered by the system design. The system thus designed represents a new
              generation of vastly expanded and enhanced  SCADA (supervisory control and data
              acquisition) systems currently used by utilities. In this expanded version, the
              hydraulic data are sensed and transmitted through mixed wired and wireless
              communications through the network. The network will automatically detect
              aggregation points where data from a region are accumulated and trigger local
              processing.  These points will produce summaries that can then be passed on to
              central observers.  When necessary, observers will be able to "drill down" on
              specific details with explicit queries and control.

The two geographically
              distant Principal Investigators provide expertise on structures/mechanics,
              lifeline systems analysis and socio-economic impact of system failure and in
              computer operating systems, network protocols, and sensor networks.  This
              combination of civil engineering and computer science expertise represents an
              ideal interdisciplinary coalition for this research.  Each will support and
              advise one graduate student and communicate each other through internet and
              frequently scheduled meetings inviting potential end users from utility
              organizations.  Broad impacts are expected on the frontier research in lifeline
              engineering, sensor network technology, simulation and neural network-based
              analysis of complex systems, and on the practice of lifeline operation and
              management.
