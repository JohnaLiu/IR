Abstract    :
              ITR Small Proposal CCR-0112501 Blum, Rick  Transmit and receive antenna
              arrays used to form multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels have shown
              great potential in isolated, single link communications without cochannel
              interference. Provided the same number of transmit and receive antennas are
              used, recent research has shown that capacity scales linearly with the number
              of transmit antennas.  This result has created an incredible flurry of
              interest among researchers.  While these MIMO systems have received extensive
              study for cases without cochannel interference, cases with cochannel
              interference have received much less attention. Further, new simulation
              results indicate that cochannel interference can significantly degrade the
              overall capacity when MIMO channels are used in a cellular system in the same
              manner in which they are used for cases without interference.  The
              investigators study the properties of MIMO systems with interference to
              develop new methods of using MIMO which adapt the transmission scheme to the
              interference environment. These new methods, called stream control algorithms,
              transmit several different streams, each one using a different transmit weight
              vector.  The maximum number of streams that can be transmitted is equal to the
              minimum of the number of transmit and receive antennas.  The exact number of
              streams chosen depends on the current sensed state of the interference
              environment.  Preliminary results indicate that significant performance gains
              can be achieved in this manner.  Using  the well developed theory of power
              control, distributed algorithms are being developed to control the number of
              streams employed in a cellular system with cochannel interference.  The use of
              space-time coding is also being studied in conjunction with stream control. 
              Wireless channels with frequency selective fading, various correlation
              structures, and other practical degradations are being studied.
