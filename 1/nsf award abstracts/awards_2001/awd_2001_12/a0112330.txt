Abstract    :
              
The Department of Mathematics at the University of California at Los Angeles
              will purchase a PC cluster which will be dedicated to the support of research
              in the mathematical sciences. This equipment will be used by researchers in the
              UCLA applied mathematics group to carry out the parametric studies required for
              the development and implementation of multi-scale mathematical models. This
              type of modeling effort is associated with several research projects and spans
              a wide range of application areas including semi-conductor growth modeling,
              computational fluid dynamics, and image processing.
