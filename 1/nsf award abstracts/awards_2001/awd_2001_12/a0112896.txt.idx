Abstract    :
              Accurate determination of protein structure and function is the focus of
              proteomics, the next step in the genomic revolution. Traditional knowledge
              discovery in molecular biology has followed a research paradigm corresponding
              to the information flow in functional genomics, that is from gene sequence to
              protein structure to function. This computational bioinformatics proposal
              exploits the information content of the protein structural and sequence
              databases following a research paradigm formulated in the title of this
              proposal, namely from structure to sequence to function prediction. The
              important postulate of this research is that spatial nearest neighbor residue
              motifs defined by the means of computational geometry (Delaunay tessellation)
              provide unique determinants of protein structure and function. The major goals
              of this proposal include: (1) development and validation of multibody
              statistical potentials on the basis of non-redundant subsets of the protein
              crystallographic database, (2) prediction of 3D protein structure by the means
              of novel implementation of the chain growth algorithm using Monte Carlo
              sampling, statistical potentials, and spatial constraints defined by specific
              residue motifs, and (3) determination of sequence and structure specific amino
              acid residue motifs for known proteins and large scale prediction of protein
              structural and functional classes for genomic sequences. The successful
              implementation of this proposal will have a broad impact on functional genomics
              and proteomics.
