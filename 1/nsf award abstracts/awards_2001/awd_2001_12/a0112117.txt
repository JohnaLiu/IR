The PI together with his two colleagues at Santa Barbara request
              funding to purchase a mid-range parallel computer dedicated for the large scale
              simulations of fluid dynamics of complex liquids.   The specific research areas
              are (1) the fluid dynamics of highly nonideal mixtures of chemical species, (2)
              the flow of complex fluids with microstructures, including polymer liquid
              crystals and suspensions, and (3) high Reynolds number flows of dilute
              polymers.
