Abstract    :
              Networked information technology has led to unprecedented opportunities for
              exchanging information in a population of participants whose interests and
              needs vary over time. In particular, this project concerns populations of 
              consumers looking for information products, and producers who possess products
              that others might be seeking. Substantial research has gone into studying how
              producers and consumers can settle the terms of a transaction for a particular
              good. However, there are many possible variations and combinations of
              information products and their prices that can be offered. A critical and
              poorly understood problem is how parties should position themselves in this
              vast information product and price space to differentiate themselves from
              competitors and attract those with whom they should transact. To address this
              problem, the investigators will use economic analysis and computer simulation
              to study how producers of information goods can learn to position themselves
              based on criteria such as price schedules and information content, and can
              adapt to changing consumer tastes where consumers might be making strategic
              buying decisions to affect producer positioning. This project will extend
              economic theory to account for these concerns, and create computational agents
              that can make adaptive, strategic decisions about product positioning.
