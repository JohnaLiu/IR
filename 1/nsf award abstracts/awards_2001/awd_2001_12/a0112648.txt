Abstract    :
              I propose to initiate a lending program to share science resources and equipment
              with
pre-service and in-service teachers and schools in the Monterey Bay
              region. K-12 teachers
have a great need for access to scientific equipment and
              for support in using scientific
equipment in their teaching. The University of
              California Santa Cruz (UCSC) is well
positioned to increase the access of
              regional schools to its own scientific equipment
through its outreach wing,
              the Educational Partnership Center (EPC), and its Division of
Natural
              Sciences. My Post-doctoral Fellowship in Science, Math, Engineering,
              and
Technology Education (PFSMETE) involved the acquisition of a basic set of
              scientific
equipment useful for various kinds of environmental monitoring by
              K-12 students. The
lending program I propose would use this existing equipment
              to provide follow-up support
for teachers with whom I worked on environmental
              monitoring projects during my
post-doctoral fellowship. It would also serve as
              a seed project for a larger
university-based equipment-sharing programs.
