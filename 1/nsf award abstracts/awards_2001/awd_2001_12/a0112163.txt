This grant provides partial support for the upgrade of the
              University of Wyoming, Dept. of Geophysics computation center.  Specific
              equipment to be purchased includes a central UNIX file server, an automated
              backup system, a 1/2 TB RAID storage system, and computational equipment to
              build a 10 node Beowulf cluster based on 1.2 GHz CPU's with a combined 1 GB of
              RAM.  The enhancements will support the heavy computational needs of a growing
              seismology group at Wyoming including recent hires Drs. Ken Dueker, Michael
              Cheadle, and Dag Nummedal in addition to Drs. Scott Smithson and Steve
              Holbrook. The  seismologists in this department are undertaking new forays into
              high-fold data (both onshore and offshore, and including 3D pre-stack data) and
              real-time acquisition and event processing of PASSCAL/GSN/NSN broadband seismic
              data via the internet. In total, they are currently processing some 3
              terrabytes of data.  The Geophysics UNIX computational facility at the
              University of Wyoming currently serves 28 users: 18 graduate students, 5
              post-doctoral researchers, 6 professors, and several undergraduates using a
              heterogeneous, dispersed mix of UNIX hardware and operating systems.  This
              upgrade will centralize processing power and ease the burden on a current
              systems administrator by adopting common operating systems and uniform
              hardware.
