Abstract    :
              It is planned to addresses the high-fidelity storage and manipulation of quantum
              information in trapped atomic ions.  Rudimentary quantum logic operations will
              be demonstrated between a few qubits, using atomic cadmium ions confined in a
              rf ion trap.  This will permit a demonstration of repetitive quantum
              error-correction schemes.  Multiplexing schemes will also be investigated.
