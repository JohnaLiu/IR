Abstract    :
              The research described here addresses information security issues for embedded
              processors and constrained environments.  Embedded processors are found in a
              vast array of existing and emerging technologies, including mobile phones,
              personal digital assistants, smart cards, and remote-controlled utility network
              devices and are distinguished from typical (but far less prevalent) PC-level
              microprocessors in their relatively low power consumption and inherent
              limitations on memory and speed.  It is predicted that the number of
              applications with embedded microprocessors which will be connected to our
              telephone and computer networks will increase dramatically over the next few
              years. For instance, it is anticipated that within the next few years, 50% of
              all Internet end-devices will have to operate in constrained environments.  At
              the same time, these networks are enabling remote access to, and manipulation
              of, sensitive resources of all sorts, including bank records, medical
              information, alarm system, and industrial machinery.  The need is clear for
              long-term planning and directed research in the area of cryptographic security
              for these devices.  The challenges represented here require the attention of
              experts from a variety of disciplines, from engineering to computer science to
              mathematics. Both fundamental and immediate problems face hardware designers,
              software engineers, and theoretical crypytographers alike.  We propose a
              three-pronged approach in an effort to contribute solutions to these problems. 
              The long-term ambition of such research is to bring cryptographic security
              solutions to the market which are low-cost, highly scalable, and suitable for
              constrained environments.  This project places particular focus on
              implementation of public-key algorithms in embedded devices and is divided into
              three modules as follow:  Development of power-efficient and scalable
              cryptographic hardware for pervasive computing.  Investigation of emerging
              public-key schemes which appear promising for implementation in constrained
              environments.  Evaluation of combinatorial structures for public-key schemes
              in hardware and on embedded processors.  This three-pronged approach combines
              a long view, cutting across disciplines, as well as a variety of very promising
              short-term objectives which assure practical relevance and payoff.
