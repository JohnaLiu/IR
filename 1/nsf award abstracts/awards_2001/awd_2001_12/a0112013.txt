The objectives of this project are (1) to determine the
              compositional characteristics and liquidus temperatures of hydrous partial
              melts formed through fluxing of mantle peridotite by a H2O-rich component from
              the subducted oceanic lithosphere, and (2) to measure mineral/melt partition
              coefficients appropriate for modeling trace element fractionations during
              partial melting of hydrous peridotite in the mantle wedge.  These goals are
              being achieved by determining experimentally (1) the compositions of hydrous
              silicate melts in equilibrium with a lherzolite mineral assemblage at 2.0 to
              3.0 GPa, (2) the effect on partial melting of adding variable amounts of a
              Na2O-K2O-H2O subduction component to the peridotite, and (3) the partitioning
              of incompatible trace elements between mantle minerals (clinopyroxene, garnet,
              amphibole) and hydrous partial melts at conditions appropriate for the mantle
              beneath volcanic arcs. The results from this experimental study will provide
              petrologic and geochemical data necessary for understanding the role of H2O in
              generating arc magmas and determining the composition of material transferred
              from the mantle to the crust by subduction-related magmatic processes. The
              results will also help to provide a framework for interpreting samples from
              MARGINS Focus Sites in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana and Central American subduction
              systems.
