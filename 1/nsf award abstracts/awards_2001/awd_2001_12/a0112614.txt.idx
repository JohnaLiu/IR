Abstract    :
              The general objective of this research is to examine the history of alluvial
              sedimentation of the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) to advance our understanding
              of how climate variability influences the magnitudes and timing of floods on
              the main channel of the UMR in western Wisconsin. This mid continent site
              contains a nearly continuous alluvial record that extends nearly 10,000 years
              and provides a unique opportunity to examine the history of long- and
              short-term extreme flow events in this important watershed.   The specific
              goals of this research are to: 1) obtain high-resolution records that can help
              reconstruct Holocene floods in the main and secondary channels of the Upper
              Mississippi River (UMR); 2) quantitatively link the flood regime of the main
              channel to independent paleoclimate proxies obtained from other researchers; 3)
              quantify and contrast the response of the UMR system to extreme hydrologic
              events during abrupt climate change and gradual climate change; 4) quantify the
              response of flood hydrology to the relative changes in climate change (i.e.,
              warmer/wetter, warmer/drier, etc) inferred from proxies.  These specific goals
              will be achieved by a combination of field, laboratory, statistical, and
              modeling analyses.  The research is important because changes in the
              frequency or intensity of extreme river flows have the potential to produce
              major impacts on both human society and the natural environment. Instrumental
              records are too short to adequately determine how climate changes fully
              influence extremes in flow hydrology on large river systems such as the UMR.
              Results from this research will help us understanding how terrestrial
              hydrologic systems respond to changes in global scale atmosphere circulation.
              The results also should be useful for understanding the relationship between
              changing climate and recurring extreme hydrologic events.
