This U.S.-Argentina award will support a planning visit by
              Dr. William I. Rose of Michigan Technological University to collaborate with
              Dr. Jose Viramonte of the Universidad Nacional de Salta in Buenos Aires,
              Argentina.  The goal of this project is to build a small support group
              interested in volcanic clouds of the Andean region and to create stronger
              collaborations.

This project will allow the monitoring of the movement of
              new volcanic products allowing the understanding of its effects. The long-term
              goal is to be able to send students to Salta to work with the local volcanic
              clouds group for several months.
