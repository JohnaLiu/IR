Abstract    :
              A grant has been awarded to Dr. R. Boopathy at Nicholls State University in
              Thibodaux, Louisiana to develop an Environmental Science Instrumentation Core
              Facility.  The purpose of this facility is threefold: (1) to enhance training
              of students in environmental sciences, (2) to enable new training of
              traditional faculty, and (3) to facilitate faculty research. This project will
              equip a laboratory of analytical instrumentation, including a gas
              chromatograph, a high performance liquid chromatograph, a UV-VIS
              Spectrophotometer, a BIOLOG Microbial Identification System, and other small
              equipment.  This essential equipment will (1) enhance educational opportunities
              and research activities of students, (2) enhance preparation of students for
              both careers and post-baccalaureate schools, (3) facilitate development of
              faculty as teachers and investigators, (4) both promote retention of existing
              faculty and facilitate attraction of new faculty, and (5) enhance the value of
              the University's environmental science program.      The University is the
              service institution to south-central Louisiana, which since the1930's has been
              a region highly cultivated by the oil and gas industry.  Appropriately, the
              analytical instruments of the facility will be used to study anaerobic
              biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated sites such as sediments
              and groundwater.  The GC and HPLC will be extensively used to quantify
              petroleum hydrocarbons and the BIOLOG System will be used to identify aerobic
              and anaerobic bacteria responsible for degrading petroleum hydrocarbons.  In
              addition, the instruments will be used to analyze other industrial contaminants
              such as chlorinated aliphatic compounds including carbon tetrachloride and
              trichloroethylene in ground water and sub-surface environmental samples.     
              The Environmental Science Instrumentation Core Facility at Nicholls State
              University will not only enhance the infrastructure of the University and its
              Environmental Science Program but also provide opportunities for students and
              faculty that have not been otherwise available.  Achievement of project goals
              will help build and strengthen the research opportunities at a regional
              Louisiana university not traditionally recognized as capable of supporting such
              potentially valuable research and training.  As the only university in a
              thirteen-parish south central Louisiana region, and through the regionally
              significant projects of individual investigators, the potential to stimulate
              economic development in a state historically lacking in economic diversity is
              high and significant.
