Abstract    :
              EAR-0112484 Jeanloz  Shimizu   The investigators propose to conduct a 2-year
              collaborative study between high-pressure experimental geophysicists at the
              University of California at Berkeley and analytical geochemists at Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution. This research will experimentally evaluate the
              feasibility and validate the measurement of trace-element partitioning between
              metal and silicate at the high pressures and temperatures of the Earth's deep
              mantle and core, ~100 GPa and 4000 K.  The possibility of combining the
              capability of the laser-heated diamond cell, to reproduce conditions of the
              planetary interior, with that of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), for
              measuring isotopic abundances at the ppm level and below on spatial scales of
              ms, will be evaluated.  If successful, these combined tools can be used as a
              means of resolving major issues in geochemistry and geophysics that depend on
              understanding the distribution of trace elements within the mantle and core. 
              Such studies are crucial for determining the potential consequences of chemical
              interactions between the core and mantle over geological time and, more
              generally, for deciphering the evolution of the Earth's deep interior.  The
              experiments proposed here are intended to help develop methodologies for
              element-partitioning studies to be pursued in the future.
