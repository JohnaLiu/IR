Abstract    :
              This is a project in matter optics, the manipulation of matter in ways analogous
              to the manipulation of light waves with optical elements.  The novel focus of
              the proposal is on the manipulation of electron, ion, and molecule matter waves
              with intense laser light.   The construction of a coherent beam splitter for
              electrons is the goal of the first experiment.  The realization of this goal
              would constitute the first demonstration of the Kapitza-Dirac effect and would
              elegantly illustrate particle-wave duality.   The second goal of the project is
              the demonstration of a coherent beam splitter in which the intense laser, not
              locked to resonance, would be used to diffract ions and molecules. 
              Possibilities for using the ion interferometer to test for spin-orbit dependent
              Aharanov-Bohm phase shifts and for using molecular diffraction to study
              decoherence will be pursued if the demonstration is successful.
