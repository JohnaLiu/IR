The investigators plan to provide an examination of the
              Earth's core-mantle boundary as an electrochemical system.  They will undertake
              a series of piston-cylinder experiments designed to investigate the effect of
              an electric field on the physical and chemical behavior at metal-silicate
              interfaces.  Both DC resistance measurements and AC impedance spectroscopy will
              be employed to examine the electrical behavior of a metal-silicate interface,
              and electron microprobe analysis will record changes in chemistry for a series
              of anodic and cathodic electrical loadings of the interface.  These results
              will be used, in turn, to show how differences in chemistry and physical
              properties overlying local areas of the core-mantle boundary may translate into
              geophysical and geochemical observables such as length of day variations, the
              behavior of the magnetic field dynamo, and creation of physical and chemical
              structure in the outer core and lower mantle.  The goal is to extend our
              understanding of the core-mantle boundary to encompass electrical and
              electrochemical behavior at high pressures and temperatures, examining both
              electrically-induced chemical partitioning and resultant core-mantle dynamic
              coupling.
