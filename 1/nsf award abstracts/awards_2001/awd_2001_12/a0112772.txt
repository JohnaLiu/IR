Abstract    :
              A new axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code will be developed for
              determining the evolution of the solar wind as a function of both heliocentric
              distance and helioaltitude. It will include the effects of the solar wind
              termination shock, and the interstellar pick up ions. Stream and transient
              structures will be imposed at the inner boundary using single-point spacecraft
              measurements combined with an helioaltitude extrapolation scheme inferred from
              Ulysses and SOHO observations. This MHD code will be combined with an existing
              axisymmetric cosmic ray transport code which accounts for particle drifts and
              allows the prescription of a very general diffusion tensor. The resulting
              compound code will greatly enhance our capability to understand the primary
              causes of galactic cosmic ray modulation throughout the solar cycle.
