Abstract    :
               The modeling of complex systems using the concept of constrained objects is
              investigated.  A constrained object is one whose internal state is regulated by
              a set of invariants, or constraints.  When several constrained objects are
              aggregated to form a complex object, their internal states might further have
              to satisfy interface constraints.   The resultant behavior of the complex
              object is determined using logical inference and constraint satisfaction. 
              Thus, constrained objects are a declarative counterpart of traditional objects
              (found  in object-oriented languages).   The proposed modeling paradigm has
              diverse uses, including engineering and organizational modeling, and supports
              constraints as well as preferences. The computational model  for constrained
              objects provides constraint satisfaction, optimization, and relaxation
              techniques.  A visual representation for constrained objects is also provided
              in such a way that the components of the visual  form have logical
              counterparts in the underlying model.  Research areas of interest include
              language design, execution, and applicatons. In particular, issues arising in
              model revision (i.e., incremental constraint satisfaction) and model
              inconsistency (i.e., fault diagnosis) will be investigated.  The results from
              this research will be incorporated in the modeling environment, which is
              expected to make a significant advance over current modeling tools for
              engineering design.
