Abstract    :
               Gibberellins (GAs) are phytohormones that regulate many aspects of plant
              growth and development. The long-term goal of this research is to understand
              the molecular basis of GA signal transduction in arabidopsis. Loss-of-function
              spy mutations suppress the phenotypes caused by GA-deficiency; thus, the SPY
              protein is a suppressor of GA signaling. SPY has extensive sequence similarity
              to animal O-GlcNAc transferase, which catalyzes the addition of a single
              O-linked N-acetylglucosamine to specific serine and/or threonine residues of
              nuclear and cytosolic proteins. O-GlcNAc modification of cytoplasmic and
              nuclear proteins is about as common as phosphorylation and is believed to be a
              regulatory modification. The work proposed here will test the model that
              SPY-catalyzed protein O-GlcNAcylation acts to negatively regulate GA signaling
              and begin to determine the details of how SPY functions in signaling
              pathway(s). SPY produced in insect cells is itself O-GlcNAc-modified and has
              GlcNAc transferase activity toward gp40, a plant nuclear pore protein that is
              known to undergo terminal O-GlcNAc modification. SPY is a component of a
              multiprotein complex present in both the nucleus and cytosol of arabidopsis
              and cauliflower. When GA-deficient plants are treated with GA, a decrease in
              the GlcNAc modification of several proteins is detectable 1 hr after treatment.
              spy mutations have similar effects. These data indicate that protein
              GlcNAcylation plays a role in GA signaling. A number of arabidopsis proteins
              that putatively interact with SPY's tetratricopeptide repeats in yeast have
              been identified. One of these proteins is GIGANTEA (GI), a protein involved in
              a number of processes that are also affected by GA. Consistent with the
              physical interaction between SPY and GI, with respect to the control of
              flowering time, spy is weakly epistatic to gi. The goals of this work are to:
              1) characterize the protein modification that is produced by SPY and determine
              the identity of its substrates; 2) determine if the localization or activity
              of SPY is regulated by determining if changes in GA levels or mutations
              affecting GA signaling alter the localization, posttranslational modification,
              protein associations, or activity of SPY; and 3) perform additional tests on
              the proteins identified in the two-hybrid screens to identify the proteins
              that physically interact with SPY and then genetically characterize the
              function of the interacting proteins. As part of the third goal, genetic and
              physiological studies will be performed to further define the functional
              interrelationships between SPY and GI.
