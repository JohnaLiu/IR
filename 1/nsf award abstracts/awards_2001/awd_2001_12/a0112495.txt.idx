Abstract    :
              Proposal #0122495 Florida State University Van Hoeij, Mark  A one day
              meeting, an  East Coast Computer Algebra Day (ECCAD), will be held at Florida
              State University, Tallahassee, Florida, on Saturday, May 5, 2001.  The meeting
              is the eighth of the series, which has been held at a variety of US East Coast
              locations since 1994. We expect 60-80 participants will be from the computer
              algebra research community or interested in scientific/engineering applications
              of computer algebra, drawn from the eastern half of North America, but
              especially from the East Coast of the United States.  The meeting includes
              invited talks and contributed poster/software demo sessions, covering the
              breadth of computer algebra: algorithms, software, and applications. We are
              requesting funding to cover travel expenses of US-based participants. The
              organizing committee intends to give preference to funding students and recent
              Ph.Ds who plan to make a presentation at the meeting.
