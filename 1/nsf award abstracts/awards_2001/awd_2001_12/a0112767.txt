Abstract    :
              This Information Technology Research project aims at developing an entropy based
              multi-objective genetic algorithm for design optimization. The algorithm is
              based on an analogy from statistical theory of gases in order to obtain a
              fullest possible representation of solutions. In the proposed algorithm,
              statistical behaviors of a sample of designs in a population will be simulated,
              as they evolve, according to those of the molecules of an ideal gas undergoing
              expansion in an enclosure.  The goal of this analogy is to obtain solutions
              with maximum entropy, that is, maximum possible uniformity and coverage along
              the Pareto frontier. The investigation will involve the development of new
              methods for handling constraints in multi-objective design optimization as well
              as new quality metrics for assessing the "goodness" of a set of equally optimum
              (Pareto) solutions.  The quality metrics will also be used to develop new
              convergence criteria for the algorithm. 

If successful, the outcome of the
              research will advance the state of the art at the level of computational tools
              that enable multi-objective engineering design optimization with applications
              to a wide class of problems. The results of this investigation will be broadly
              disseminated for the engineering design automation community, transferred and
              integrated into several courses at the graduate and undergraduate levels at the
              University of Maryland, and transferred to industry.
