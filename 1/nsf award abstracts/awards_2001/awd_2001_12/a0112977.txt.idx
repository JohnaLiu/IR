Abstract    :
              Future generation mobile wireless communication systems (third generation and
              beyond) are expected to provide high data rates, accomodate highly mobile
              users, and support a wide variety of services including data, voice, video and
              interactive multimedia. Power (battery) limitations and the scarcity of radio
              spectrum (relative to the ambitions of such services) will dictate the need
              for cellular networks in which these resources must be used highly efficiently
              so as to support the continued growth in demand for wireless services into the
              future. The essential infrastructure required at the physical layer to
              fulfill this demand is a power and bandwidth efficient, multi-antenna,
              multi-user wireless communications technology.  The investigators of this
              project will develop several key aspects of a theory of  multi-user,
              multi-transmit antenna communication through a study of high-performance,
              interference resistant receivers, signature sequence designs and multi-user
              signal constellation optimization. Their goal is to realize, through simple
              system design, the power and spectral efficiency trade-offs that are
              achievable for multi-antenna wireless communications over fading channels.
              While emphasizing fundamental limits, the investigators will also focus on
              complexity constrained systems as well. They will develop results in the
              theory of multi-user detection and signature sequence optimization for
              multiple receive antennas for overloaded CDMA systems. Generalization of these
              results will be pursued to coded modulation and multiple transmit (and
              receive) antenna systems in order to further improve the performance and/or
              achievable spectral efficiencies through more sophisticated signaling
              strategies combined with sub-optimal, complexity-constrained, high-performance
              multi-user decoding methods.
