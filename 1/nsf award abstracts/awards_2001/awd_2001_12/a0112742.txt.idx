Abstract    :
              EIA-0112742 Schimpf, Paul Washington State University  ITR/Comp Bio:
              Computational Tools for Inverse Electromagnetic Problems  The principal
              investigator previously developed an adaptive algorithm for solving the Poisson
              problem in complex three-dimensional domains.  This algorithm found immediate
              application in modeling the electric field produced by surgically implanted
              defibrillators as a guide to electrode placement for the cardiologist, where
              the algorithm reduced solution times from 3 hours to less than 10 minutes.  A
              logical next step is the pursuit of more demanding applications, such as those
              with an inverse problem formulation. The inverse problem seeks to identify
              volume energy sources on the basis of electric field measurements on the
              surface or magnetic field measurements outside of the modeled domain. In
              general, there is no unique solution unless some a-priori knowledge of
              the sources is exploited.  Inverse problems can be formulated for many
              applications with domains governed by partial differential equations. They are
              computationally intensive because many forward computations are typically
              required for a solution to the inverse problem.  The primary aim of this work
              is to develop an efficient and practical inverse algorithm based on a
              hierarchical spatial decomposition of the domain, integrate it with the
              existing forward algorithm, and disseminate it to researchers with a need to
              solve such problems.  Cardiology and neurology are examples of two fields that
              can benefit from the availability of such tools.  In clinical applications,
              these tools can prove invaluable in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. In
              research applications, these tools can improve our knowledge of the fundamental
              behavior of the system.
