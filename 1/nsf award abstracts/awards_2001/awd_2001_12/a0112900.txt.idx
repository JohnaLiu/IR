Abstract    :
              The U.S. medical system faces an impending crisis: how to provide for the
              medical needs of a rapidly aging population. This project will investigate new
              technologies for "just-in-time" preventative health education in the home.
              Prior work on using computer telephony to deliver health education and
              counseling to people in their homes will be extended to mobile computing
              devices. Algorithms will be investigated that passively and actively collect
              data from healthy users of mobile computing devices and use that data to
              identify patterns of everyday activity using probabilistic models. The activity
              of each person will be used to present preventative health information and
              counseling at "teachable moments" -- the times when that information is most
              likely to impact the user's health-related decision making.  A prototype system
              for elderly individuals interested in improving their exercise level and diet
              will be collaboratively developed by technologists and medical professionals. 
              A participatory design process will be used to ensure the devices are easy to
              use, even for those who are not computer literate. The prototype system will be
              evaluated in a small focus group study.
