Abstract    :
              Open source software relies on the expertise of developers around the world, who
              volunteer to produce software collaboratively. Their mode of collaboration
              requires participants to share the results of their work freely with others. By
              revealing the source code of the programs on which they work, developers
              participating in these collaborations are able to design new features, fix bugs
              in programs, and tailor the software to suit their own needs. The
              attractiveness of engaging in this method of producing software in the Internet
              environment has led to the emergence and growth of specialized, online virtual
              communities whose members follow rather clearly established procedures in
              performing their professional tasks, but are otherwise bound together by loose
              rules of association. This project inquires into the sustainability of such
              organizations, and the likely extent of their domain of viability-in terms of
              the kinds of goods and services that might reliably be supplied in this way. 
              The investigation has three more proximate empirical objectives. The first is
              to identify typical patterns in the evolution of these communities' informal
              organizational structures and their norms of conduct. The development of
              procedural authority, and other means of resolving conflicts among individuals
              in regard to the substance of their work, and of verifying and validating their
              contributions, are subjects for special study. The second objective is to
              characterize the distribution of effort input within these communities and its
              relationship to the structure and distribution of internal "rewards," and
              derived external benefits for different levels of participation.  These tasks
              will be approached through analysis of passively collected data, participant
              responses to email survey questionnaires, and in-depth case histories of
              particular communities. A third and larger goal is to understand the dynamics
              of these "virtual communities" and the similarities and differences they
              exhibit in comparisons with collaborative organizations involving spatially
              distributed academic ("open science") researchers whose work is enabled by
              computer-mediated telecommunications
