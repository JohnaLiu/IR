Abstract    :
              The process of global economic change has required that social movements
              concerned with labor, the environment, women's rights, and fair trade organize
              and operate across national boundaries.  Many social movements have thus forged
              transnational ties, possess members in more than one nation, and engage in
              action against global forces of economic liberalization.  Although scholars
              have studied domestic social movements in some detail, the emergence of
              transnational movements raises several important questions:  how do activists
              and organizations build coalitions across national boundaries, how do they
              negotiate strategies of action and identity with partners in other nations, and
              how do they deal with special constraints and differences inherent in
              cross-national action?  This project investigates these questions by studying
              several successful, highly active, and well-funded coalitions between United
              States and Mexican labor unions, as well as some more temporary and less
              successful alliances.  The project's methods rely on semi-structured,
              in-depth interviews with a selected sample of leaders, organizers, and
              rank-and-file members who have participated in cross-nation labor actions or
              acted as brokers between Mexican and American unions.  The results describe the
              breadth and depth of transnational networks among labor movements, identify the
              organizational and cultural means by which networks emerge across national
              boundaries, and explain how coalitions manage to cooperate and overcome
              conflict in the face of differing national, ethnic, and linguistic identities. 
              The project thus provides a clearer understanding of how transnational economic
              change shapes local and national labor movements, and how such movements
              respond to the new global environment they face.
