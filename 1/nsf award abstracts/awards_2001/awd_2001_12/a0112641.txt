Abstract    :
              This award supports travel expenses for the Principal Investigator and a Ph.D
              candidate to attend and present an invited paper of research results at the
              International Scientific conference on Digital Libraries to be held in
              Petrozavodsk, Russia  in September, 2001.

The presentation by the Principal
              Investigator at this event serves multiple purposes.  His area of research,
              image database security, is a critical one to the development of generally
              accessible international Digital Libraries.  This conference is an important
              one for the active Russian Digital Libraries community and brings together
              international experts to discuss international research collaboration issues
              involved in building a global information infrastructure.  Dr. Wang will be one
              of few US speakers and will continue to demonstrate the US digital libraries
              community's interest and support for Russian efforts in this area.  Funding is
              being provided by the Division of International Programs.
