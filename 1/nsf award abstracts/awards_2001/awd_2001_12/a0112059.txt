Abstract    :
              This collaborative research project will examine how some of the techniques that
              have been used for English text recognition can be used with enhanced
              technologies for OCR of Indian language documents.  The proposal will create
              data resources for testing and evaluating Devanagari recognition systems. 
              Devanagari is the script used by a number of Indian spoken languages, prominent
              among which are Sanskrit, Hindi and Marathi.  It is an alphabetic script, used
              by over 450 million people around the world.  The research will be carried out
              by teams from the Center of Excellence for Document Analysis and Recognition at
              SUNY-Buffalo and the Indian Statistical Institute.  The project is expected to
              result in new tools for Devanagari and to stimulate research in other areas of
              script recognition for NLP, document analysis and information retrieval.
