Abstract    :
              0112782 Downs  This grant, supported through funds from both the
              NSF/Information Technology Research - Small Grants Program and the Earth
              Science Instrumentation and Facilities Program, will facilitate the development
              of a comprehensive database and suite of user-friendly analysis tools that will
              permit a wide variety of scientific and educational investigations using
              crystal structures and their properties over the Internet. The database will
              contain the known crystal structure parameters of every mineral or other earth
              related material published in the scientific literature since 1915. A suite of
              interactive software will be developed for visualization, manipulation and
              analysis of the data, along with a set of guides to instruct the user and
              provide help for classroom education. Dissemination of the database
              information, the analysis tools, and the educational guides will occur via
              links from the websites of the Mineralogical Society of America and the
              Mineralogical Association of Canada, and will be expedited through traditional
              publications. In addition, these resources will be incorporated in the NSF
              Digital Library for Earth Science Education (DLESE). Students and scientists of
              all disciplines will be able to explore and analyze crystal structure data with
              state-of-the-art software. The basic features of the software will be
              established with default settings that allow a range of users, from the high
              school student in chemistry to the professional mineralogist, to investigate
              fundamental properties of minerals including: crystal chemical parameters such
              as bond lengths and angles, polyhedral volumes and distortions, thermal
              vibration amplitudes, and rigid body motion parameters; crystal forms; fixed
              wavelength or energy dispersive X-ray and neutron diffraction patterns; and
              electron densities and bonding analyses. Furthermore, a library of movies
              showing crystal structures evolving with temperature, pressure, and
              composition, or undergoing phase transitions, will be provided as a means to
              interpret the crystal structure data collected at these conditions. The
              software will incorporate features that allow the user to produce their own
              movies that can also be contributed to the library.  ***
