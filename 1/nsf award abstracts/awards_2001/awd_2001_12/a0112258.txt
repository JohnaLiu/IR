Abstract    :
                 A central issue in brain function is how patterns of sequential neural
              activity are created to produce sophisticated motor patterns in activities such
              as communication behavior, ranging from mating calls to language.  In
              well-studied songbirds, singing-related activity occurs in a region known as RA
              (robust nucleus of the archistriatum), where individual neurons generate highly
              reproducible patterns of high-frequency bursts.  Onsets and endings of these
              bursts show temporal correlations across large populations of neurons in this
              region, suggesting that RA undergoes synchronized transitions from one state of
              active neurons to another.  The goal of this project is to develop models of
              how such sequence generation can occur, and test these models experimentally. 
              A unique approach is used with a novel technology for stable cellular
              recordings from a sleeping bird, in which such structured bursts occur with
              patterns apparently 'replaying' the patterns produced during actual singing.
 
               Results will be important for understanding mechanisms of sequence generation
              and of motor learning in the vertebrate brain, and could have an impact
              extending to mechanisms of human speech production.  This combined
              computational and experimental work also provides a young PI with a
              cross-disciplinary experience that includes university-industry
              collaboration.
