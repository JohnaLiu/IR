Abstract    :
              The Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the
University of Iowa
              will purchase computer equipment (a Microway 
Beowulf cluster for intensive
              computation as well as 3 workstations 
for individual faculty at a total cost
              of $88411) which will be dedicated 
to the support of research in
              computational, applied, and theoretical 
statistics. The equipment will be
              used for several research projects, 
including in particular:

   1.  The
              extension, implementation and application of
       posterior simulators (John
              Geweke)
   2.  Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms and convergence
      
              assessment in Bayesian hierarchical models with application to
       spatial
              and temporal modeling (Mary Kathryn Cowles)
   3.  Analysis of unreplicated
              experiments (Russell Lenth)
   4.  On  Inference  in  Continuous-Time  Models
              
       with Applications to Finance (Osnat Stramer)
   5.  Analysis of
              surface roughness data and studying the properties 
       of fractal
              dimension estimator in a class of stationary 
       non-Gaussian random
              fields (Grace Chan)
