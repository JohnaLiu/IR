Abstract    :
              	One of the fundamental questions in molecular biology concerns the role of
              RNA-binding proteins in regulating the processing, transport, stability,
              subcellular localization, and translation of specific messages in eukaryotic
              cells.  The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the role of Scp160p,
              a 160kDa RNA-binding protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a factor
              contributing to the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in
              yeast.  The specific objectives of this three-year project are: (1) to identify
              and characterize yeast proteins that interact, physically and/or functionally,
              with Scp160p, (2) to characterize the mRNA components of Scp160p-containing
              complexes, and to explore the biological consequence of Scp160p interaction
              with these messages, and (3) to initiate structure/function studies of Scp160p
              by using deletion mutagenesis to define regions of the protein that are
              essential for function.  All three objectives will be pursued using a
              combination of genetic and biochemical approaches well-suited to the yeast
              model system.  The results of these studies will be significant in at least
              five ways.  First, in the course of defining yeast proteins that associate with
              Scp160p, novel factors not previously recognized to play a role in gene
              expression may be identified.  Second, the specific mRNA components of Scp160p
              complexes to be identified in Aim 2 will represent not only targets of Scp160p
              function, but also may provide insight into the variety of cellular processes
              whose disruption leads to the scp160-null phenotype.  Third, the
              structure/function studies described in Aim 3 will address the long-standing
              question of whether individual KH domains in a multiple KH domain protein
              function independently or dependently of one another.  Fourth, a number of
              important reagents will be developed in the course of this work, including a
              panel of truncated alleles of Scp160p, and both wild-type and mutant clones of
              genes with which Scp160p interacts.  Finally, by elucidating the function and
              interactions of Scp160p in yeast, this project will provide a foundation to
              enable studies of other RNA-binding proteins in more complex systems, including
              humans.

	The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the role of
              Scp160p as a factor contributing to the post-transcriptional regulation of gene
              expression in yeast.  Studies will include both genetic and biochemical
              approaches to (1) identify and characterize yeast proteins that interact,
              physically and/or functionally, with Scp160p, (2) characterize the mRNA
              components of Scp160p-containing complexes, and explore the biological
              consequence of Scp160p interaction with these messages, and (3) initiate
              structure/ function studies of Scp160p by using deletion mutagenesis to define
              regions of the protein that are essential for function.  Because Scp160p is a
              member of a large family of RNA-binding proteins found in both eukaryotes and
              prokaryotes, the results of these studies are not only relevant to Scp160p in
              yeast; they may also provide a foundation for future studies of other
              RNA-binding proteins in more complex systems, including humans.
