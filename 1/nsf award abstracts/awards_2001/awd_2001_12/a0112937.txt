Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to put new and cutting-edge computational
              applications in the hands of high school students in after-school club settings
              in underserved communities. These tools will allow the students to build
              tangible and ubiquitous computing applications that will find genuine utility
              in the communities that surround the schools. For the first half of the
              project, we will be planning with our partner schools and making connections in
              the adjacent communities. We will also be crafting the initial technology
              platforms for the students. The final phase of the project will entail high
              school students working jointly with researchers to build community-centered
              applications. New insights will be gained on how to develop toolkits for young
              designers and, for the young designers, how to design and evaluate
              computational applications. This work will also suggest new ways to engage
              underserved communities in building and using the nation's information
              infrastructure.
