Abstract    :
              PROJECT SUMMARY
The Department of  Mathematics at University of Pittsburgh
              proposes to
build a medium to large-scale scientific computing environment
              for
research in the mathematical sciences. The computer equipment to
be
              purchased includes an Intel 8 processor shared memory computational
server, a
              four node Intel cluster and an Intel file server, all running
Linux.

   
              This computing environment will enhance ongoing research in several
ways. The
              availability of a local infrastructure for the investigation of
shared and
              distributed memory techniques will result in a significant
reduction in the
              time needed for developing software. The currently
available computational
              power would be substantially expanded allowing for
increased size and
              complexity in test problems and simulations. The
investigators will be able to
              share a complete, constantly updated
state-of-the-art computational science
              environment.

The computing equipment will support several research projects,
              including
in particular: computational methods for fluid dynamics,
              numerical
modeling of flow in porous media, numerical methods for problems
              with
complementarity constraints, and computational neuroscience.
