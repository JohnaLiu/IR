Abstract


Understanding the dynamical
              behavior of virus particles, e.g., the self assembly and subsequent maturation
              steps that lead to an infectious virus particle, is a key challenge in basic
              biology (e.g., the understanding of protein-nucleic acid interactions) and in
              medicine (e.g., the development of drugs that interfere with viral
              replication).  This research contributes to that goal by developing new
              computational tools for structural biology, emphasizing experimental approaches
              appropriate for the study of dynamics and emphasizing the bi-directional
              interplay of new structural biology problems and new formulations of existing
              structural biology problems with the development of new computational
              tools.

Models and computation for new types of experiments are under
              development, e.g., x-ray scattering from solutions of labeled viral particles
              which are oriented by immersion in a strong electric field thereby transforming
              solution scattering to something analogous to the more informative fiber
              diffraction.  New computational approaches to standard problems are also under
              development, e.g., phase retrieval for the x-ray crystallography of particles
              with non-crystallographic symmetries based on iterative phase retrieval
              algorithms applied to lattices that are computationally oversampled by
              interpolators based on the symmetry.  Computational areas involved include fast
              3-D Radon transform algorithms, a component of computing the cryo electron
              micrograph predicted from a given virus structure, and global optimization, in
              order to improve the values of the parameters that describe the virus
              structure.

The PIs have a long term interest in undergraduate involvement in
              research and financial support for undergraduate research assistants is
              included.
