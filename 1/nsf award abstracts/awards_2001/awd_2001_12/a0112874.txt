Abstract    :
              This project develops a curriculum to incorporate information systems security
              education into the graduate and undergraduate programs. The project contains
              four phases: development and revision of information security courses,
              production of security modules for selected courses, development of an
              information security certificate graduate program, extension of library
              resources to include security references, and construction of an information
              systems security laboratory to support class activities and research.
