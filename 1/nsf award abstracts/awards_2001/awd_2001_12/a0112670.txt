Abstract    :
              The time of divergence of species is a fundamental question of evolution.  Some
              species on Earth are separated by billions of years whereas others diverged
              only thousands of years ago.  Understanding the divergences times is critical
              for looking at rates of change across biology.  Divergence times are obtained
              from the fossil record and molecular clocks, where time is measured by regular
              changes in DNA and proteins.  A biological database of species divergence
              times, using fossil and molecular data, is being designed and developed to
              provide scientists with this information.  The database will be web-based and
              provide molecular times at different taxonomic levels, with statistics of
              multigene time distribution.  The ready access to this information will
              accelerate research in diverse fields of science ranging from molecular biology
              to geochemistry and astrobiology.
