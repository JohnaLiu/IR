The investigators will work on several closely related
              subjects that will address important problems with respect to the structure and
              chemical and dynamical evolution of the Earth's mantle.  The work will entail a
              combination of approaches using geochemical reservoir models that take into
              account the dispersion in both radiogenic isotope ratios and parent/daughter
              ratios in the mantle to obtain a simple theory that can combine fluxes and
              residence time estimates from traditional geochemical reservoir models with
              mixing times from three dimensional mantle convection models. Test results for
              the Nd and Sr isotopic systems demonstrate the validity of this approach.  It
              is also proposed to combine reservoir models for isotopic transport and
              evolution with a parameterized convection model that will integrate the
              chemical evolution with thermal evolution. The parameterized models will
              include important effects that have only recently been identified, such as the
              bending of the lithosphere.
