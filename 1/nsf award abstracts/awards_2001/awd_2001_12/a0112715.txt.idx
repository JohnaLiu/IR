Abstract    :
              An effective way of using increasing powerful computer systems in improving
              numerical weather prediction is through ensemble forecasting. Experience shows
              that the ensemble forecasts do not diverge enough so that often the true state
              of the atmosphere lies outside the spread of the ensemble. In this project, the
              PIs seek to broaden the spread by exploring the variability of model's climate
              through the perturbation of the convective processes. The approach is to
              introduce stochastic noise in cumulus parameterization schemes to account for
              the sub-grid scale effects. The design of the fluctuations will be based on
              high-resolution data from cloud-resolving models, radars, aircraft, and
              radiosondes. These ideas will be implemented in models with different types of
              complexity. The results have the potential of providing new methods for
              improving ensemble forecast systems at major meteorological centers and also
              leading to improved understanding of existing cumulus parameterization. This
              project is being done collaboratively between Drs. Brian Mapes and Thomas
              Hamill, CIRES, University of Colorado and Dr. Steven Mullen, University of
              Arizona.
