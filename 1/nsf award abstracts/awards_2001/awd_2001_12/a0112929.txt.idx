Abstract    :
              0112929 Zheng This ITR/AP Small Group Award supports development of efficient
              and robust computational methods for simulating physical systems involving
              phenomena at drastically different length scales.  The results will serve an
              important need in computer-aided design, analysis and modeling. A classic
              example is a system that involves fluid-solid interfaces with complex
              geometries on scales ranging from molecular to macroscopic. On one hand,
              computational modeling approaches based on continuum approximations (e.g.,
              finite-element and finite -difference techniques) are capable of describing
              mechanical responses only at wavelengths much longer than the typical distances
              over which the fluid density at interfaces varies appreciably. On the other
              hand, the whole system is far too large to be treated by a fully atomistic
              simulation that would encompass responses at all scales simultaneously. To
              address this problem a hybrid Monte Carlo-finite element scheme, in which fluid
              molecules at the interface are treated explicitly, while the solid is handled
              by continuum techniques, will be applied. A "reduced" description in which the
              stochastic variables consist of the positions of the fluid molecules and the
              nodes of the finite-element mesh covering the solid phase will be developed.
              The stochastic nature of Monte Carlo lends itself to an efficient parallel
              computing scheme, which is crucial for simulating real-world systems. A
              multi-disciplinary team has been assembled to undertake the three-year project,
              the expected outcome of which is a powerful computational scheme for analyzing
              the thermomechanical response of realistic fluid-solid systems in which the
              coupling of the molecularly heterogeneous interfaces to the macroscopic
              continuum plays an essential role. ***
