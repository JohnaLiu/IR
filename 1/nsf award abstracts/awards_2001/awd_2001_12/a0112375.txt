Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the University of Kansas will
purchase
              advanced graphics workstations and a parallel compute
server which will be
              dedicated to the support of research in the
mathematical sciences. The
              equipment will be used for several
research projects, including in
              particular:

	Parallel eigenvalue computations. (Ralph Byers)

	Higher
              dimensional immersive visualization of dynamical
	systems.  (Estella
              Gavosto)

	Adaptive moving-mesh methods for numerical solution
              of
	evolutionary partial differential equations and its
	applications. 
              (Wiezhang Huang)

	Computation in commutative algebra and algebraic
              geometry.
	(Craig Huneke)

	Spectral analysis of biological nanostructures.
