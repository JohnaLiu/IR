Abstract    :
              This project will develop tools that make it possible to retrieve naturally
              occurring sentences from the World Wide Web on the basis of lexical content and
              syntactic structure, providing linguists with an immediate, easily accessible
              source of raw linguistic data.  The PIs will investigate specific linguistic
              hypotheses at the lexical semantics/syntax interface as an illustrative
              application of these tools.  At a high level, the planned work constitutes an
              important step toward a new paradigm for linguistic research.  Rather than
              relying entirely on introspective data generated by the linguist who is trying
              to (dis)prove a particular hypothesis, Web-enabled linguistics research will
              draw on the methodology and the tools developed by the PIs to supply naturally
              occurring data on which theories can rest.  With regard to specific linguistic
              questions, the goal is to provide an explanation of the rules and constraints
              that govern three transitivity alternations (Middle, Unaccusative, Unspecified
              Object Deletion), and the PIs expect data made available by their tools to shed
              light on the "grey" area between competence and performance, that is, the
              linguistic behavior that seems to fall outside of rule-governed behavior.  
              Although naturally occurring data are not accorded great emphasis in generative
              syntax, the use of text corpora has a tradition in the greater linguistic
              enterprise.    An explosive new phenomenon in the world of naturally occurring
              text, the World Wide Web is an essentially untapped resource that embodies the
              rich and dynamic nature of language, presenting a data resource of unparalleled
              size and diversity
