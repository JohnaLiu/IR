Abstract    :
              The goal of the IGBP is to improve understanding of the interactive physical,
              chemical and biological processes that regulate the Earth system; the unique
              environment that it provides for life; the changes that are occurring in this
              system; and the manner in which they are influenced by, and in turn influence,
              human actions.  The IGBP scientific program, which was implemented initially
              around eight "core projects" addressing specific multi-disciplinary aspects of
              the Earth system, is being restructured into a more concise and integrated
              structure reflecting the dynamics of the Earth system, with broad activities
              organized around main components of the system-atmosphere, ocean and land-and,
              equally importantly, at the interfaces between these components.  Two
              overarching and integrating activities-the Global Analysis, Integration and
              Modeling program (GAIM) and the Study of Past Global Changes (PAGES) - will
              address the Earth system as a whole.  This new focus on the Earth system will
              also address issues of major societal importance which link strongly to changes
              in Earth system dynamics, particularly global sustainability, e.g.,
              cross-cutting research on (i) the global carbon cycle, (ii) food and fiber
              production, and (iii) water resources.  The new focus for the IGBP will be
              developed in large part through the IGBP Open Science Conference, which will
              present the latest results of global change research at a series of levels:
              research conducted throught the individual IGBP core projects and research
              integrated across these projects; research that has been integrated between the
              IGBP and the WCRP, the IHDP, Diversitas, the Global Change System for Analysis,
              Research and Training(START), other regional programs, and individual research
              projects on which these integrated efforts are based.  The Conference will also
              identify new approaches to study of the complex planetary system in which human
              activities are closely linked with natural processes.  The IGBP's Scientific
              Committee, its IGBP's Officers, and its Secretariat will lead planning for the
              IGBP's scientific agenda; promote initiation, oversee and keep under review
              implementation of the program; foster archiving and exchange of collected data
              and scientific results; develop standards for measurements and data analysis;
              lead integration and synthesis of the research into a coherent and
              comprehensive global picture; avoid duplication of effort and resource use; and
              communicate research results and data to a number of audiences.
