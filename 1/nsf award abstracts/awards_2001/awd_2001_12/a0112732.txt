Abstract    :
              This research project will explore the utility of adjoint-based methods of
              ensemble prediction for El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), with the view to
              support the development of a new operational ensemble prediction scheme for
              ENSO. The PIs will use a hierarchy of coupled ENSO models that represent
              different levels of approximation of coupled ocean-atmosphere General
              Circulation Models (GCM). In addition to exploring singular vector and
              stochastic optimal based ensemble prediction techniques, they will compare
              these techniques with the method of bred modes that is currently used for
              ensemble weather prediction at the National Centers for Environmental
              Prediction. The ensemble prediction experiments will be analyzed using
              conventional statistical techniques and using a new theoretical framework based
              on information theory. The research builds on existing methods and ideas that
              have been applied successfully to Numerical Weather Prediction on timescales of
              5-10 days using complex state-of-the-art atmospheric GCMs. The techniques have
              been applied successfully to ENSO prediction using simple coupled models,
              however, the application of existing ideas to complex ENSO prediction presents
              some significant new challenges that need to be addressed. The work is
              important because it has the potential to improve ENSO forecasts, which has
              important societal benefits.
