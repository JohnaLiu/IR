Abstract    :
              
  Computer Scientists have been challenged by the existence of
remarkable
              algorithms that work well in practice, but whose
theoretical analyses suggest
              that these algorithms should perform
poorly or are inconclusive.  The root of
              this problem is that
traditional theoretical analyses measure the performance
              of
algorithms on their worst inputs.  This research analyzes the
performance
              of algorithms using smoothed analysis, a new measure of
the performance of
              algorithms that can better predict practical
performance.  Using smoothed
              analysis, this research aims to explain
the good practical performance of some
              algorithms that are famous
for outperforming pessimistic worst-case
              analyses.


  In particular, algorithms that take real or complex inputs,
              such as
those that usually occur in scientific and engineering
              applications,
are examined under random perturbations of their worst-case
              inputs.
The most famous of these, the simplex method for linear
              programming,
was the subject of the paper introducing smoothed analysis.  Yet,
              this
work only investigated one rarely-used pivot rule.  This
              research
attempts smoothed analyses of the simplex method under more
              commonly
used pivot rules.  It also considers smoothed analyses of
              interior
point methods and algorithms for convex programming.  An attempt
              is
being made to extend this analysis to algorithms that take
              discrete
inputs.
