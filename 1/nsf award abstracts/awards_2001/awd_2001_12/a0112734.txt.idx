Abstract    :
               ABSTRACT DMS 0112734-   The two main uses of much of the scientific data
              currently being collected are first to use the data to predict the types of
              future objects observed by means of computerized algorithms.  For instance, one
              such problem is to develop algorithms that will classify the millions of
              stellar objects recorded on photographic images by optical and radio
              telescopes.  Second: to understand which variables are discriminating between
              different types of objects.  An example is in locating the gene activity that
              discriminates between cancerous and non cancerous DNA.  This project builds on
              a recently discovered algorithm called random forests which, when further
              developed and combined with interactive graphical displays, will provide an
              advanced tool for answering these questions.  Random forests is a new
              prediction algorithm coming from the Machine Learning context that functions by
              combining hundreds of randomly generated binary decision.  It has demonstrated
              state-of-the-art prediction accuracy on large data sets with thousands of
              variables.  It generates a wealth of information about the data other than the
              prediction.  This information can be used to estimate variable importance,
              clustering, density estimation etc.  To make this information more readily
              understandable to the user, interactive graphics such as parallel coordinates
              and hierarchical cluster diagrams linked together will be incorporated into the
              design of a program using a more highly developed random forests algorithm as
              the underlying engine.
