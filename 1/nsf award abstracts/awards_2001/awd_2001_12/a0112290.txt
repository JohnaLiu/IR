It is proposed to undertake a collaborative study of
              mantle influences on the geodynamo, combining geodynamics, geodynamo modeling
              and paleomagnetism, focusing on three timescales. 

First, by looking at the
              last 5 million years the long timescale behavior of the dynamo over a period
              for which both the time averaged field and the paleosecular variation can be
              determined paleomagnetically will be examined. Furthermore, on this timescale
              the lowermost mantle is essentially unchanged from that which is imaged using
              seismic tomography, so modern tomographic images of the mantle can be used.
              

Second, changes in reversal frequency, concentrating on the period from the
              Cretaceous Normal Superchron to the present day will be examined, including the
              effect of plume formation at the base of the mantle on the occurrence of
              reverse flux patches in the magnetic field. 

Third, preliminary
              investigations will be conducted on the very long-term changes in the magnetic
              field occurring over timescales of several hundred million years. This work
              will involve a statistical re-analysis of the available paleomagnetic
              measurements to assess what kinds of geodynamo experiments will be relevant to
              understanding such long-term changes. 

The dynamo modeling and geodynamical
              modeling will be performed at Harvard; the paleomagnetic aspects of the
              proposal, involving data compilation, analysis, and field modeling will be
              performed at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The work will be coordinated
              between the two institutions primarily by electronic means, supplemented by
              visits and short-term exchange of students between the institutions.
