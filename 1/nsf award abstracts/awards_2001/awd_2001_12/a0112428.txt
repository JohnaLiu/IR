Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59)

Taking the Lead is a highly participatory conference
              bringing together Deans of Education and Engineering to form collaborations and
              to discuss the positive impact that such partnerships can have on the
              technological literacy of future K-12 teachers. This is the first time that
              education and engineering leaders have come together in a formal meeting. The
              potential benefits of these collaborations are numerous. Engineering programs
              can provide educators with technical expertise and real world applications of
              science and mathematics. Schools of education have much to contribute to
              engineering schools in terms of effective pedagogy, instructional design, and
              assessment. The outcomes of this conference will be an overall strategic plan
              that has broad impact on campus reform and specific action plans for the
              individual institutions represented.
