Abstract    :
              This project will design and develop experiments of a method of determining the
              electron density and the magnetic field in the magnetosphere.  It utilizes
              tomographic reconstruction using the group delay and Faraday rotation of
              signals from a cluster of satellites in the magnetosphere.  The project will
              examine the accuracy of the technique under different conditions, and will
              include the effects of hot plasma on propagation, the characteristics of
              different transmitted waveforms, and different receiver properties.
