              Duke University TITLE: ITR/SY(CISE): Cache-Oblivious Data Structures  As the
              memory system in modern computers grows more complex, it is becoming
              increasingly important to design algorithms that are sensitive to the structure
              of the memory. One of the essential features of modern memory systems is that
              they are made up of a hierarchy of several levels of cache, main memory, and
              disk. While traditional theoretical memory models have assumed a "flat" memory
              with uniform access time, the access times of different levels of memory can
              vary by several orders of magnitude in current machines. For example, level-one
              cache is often around 100 times faster than main memory, while main memory is
              around 1,000,000 times faster than disks. In order to amortize the large
              access time of memory levels far away from the processor, memory systems often
              transfer data between memory levels in large blocks. Thus it is becoming
              increasingly important to obtain high data locality in memory access
              patterns.  This project will focus on the challenging problems encountered
              when trying to maintain data locality in irregular and dynamic problems, where
              by definition the data flow is continually changing and unpredictable, making
              it difficult to organize data locality a priori. In particular, cache-oblivious
              dynamic data structures will be developed-such data structures can in turn be
              used to develop cache-efficient algorithms. Only very recently was the first
              (and only) such dynamic cache-oblivious data structure developed. This
              structure is a cache-oblivious version of a search tree. The ambitious goal of
              this project is to develop cache-oblivious structures for other fundamental
              problems. In the process general techniques for designing cache-oblivious data
              structures will be developed. Data structures with applications in a variety of
              application areas will be considered, but there will be a particular focus on
              geometric structures. Such structures often have important applications in e.g.
              spatial databases and geographic information systems (GIS). The project is
              high-risk because almost nothing is known about dynamic cache-oblivious data
              structures, but it has the potential to revolutionize the area of cache- and
              I/O-efficient computation and to make a tremendous practical impact. Ultimately
              this research could lead to a standard library of cache-oblivious data
              structures. Such platform-independent data structures would enable programmers
              to easily develop a wide variety of applications that obtain high performance
              on all modern memory hierarchies.
