Abstract    :
               This research designs and examines models in which credit constraints arise
              endogenously due to imperfect enforcement, and considers the consequences it
              has for life-cycle behavior of consumption, labor supply and investment in
              human and physical capital. The endogeneity of the constraints allows the
              models to capture the response of private markets to the policies of the
              government. The policies examined include taxation of labor and capital income,
              education subsidies, public provision of schooling, and social security.  The
              research also analyzes changes in the institutional framework of private
              creditor markets, and  examines the existing Guaranteed Student Loan Program .
                     It is expected that insights and findings from the research will be
              used for evaluating, and suggesting possible improvements in the current
              student loan programs in the United States. It is important to understand how
              the Guaranteed Student Loan Program affects incentives to invest in human
              capital, interacts with credit markets, and generates incentives to default.
              More efficient loan programs may be possible, and can only be found by
              understanding the origins of  credit constraints.
