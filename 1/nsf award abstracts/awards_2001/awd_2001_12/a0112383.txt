Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at the University of Connecticut at
Storrs will
              purchase a file-server, a rack-mounted cluster for
parallel computation and
              visualization equipment which will be
dedicated to the support of research in
              the mathematical sciences.
The equipment will be used for several research
              projects, including in
particular: the following work of faculty with the
              assistance of
graduate students and post-doctoral fellows:

Prof. Choi's
              work on parallel algorithms to assist the virtual cell
project in mathematical
              biology; Prof. Neumann will study the
parallelization of algorithms associated
              to transition probabilities
of Markov chains; geometric analysis and
              associated visualization of
extensions of mappings, conformal geometry of
              manifolds and special
surfaces such as rational minimal surfaces are the focus
              of
investigations by Profs. Abikoff and McCune; topological computations
and
              related algebraic and symbolic computations of 3-dimensional
manifolds and of
              the structure of modules over the Steenrod algebra
which arise from the
              classifying spaces of certain vector bundles will
be conducted by Profs.
              Giambalvo and Tollefson; Computational partial
differential equations with
              applications in the physical sciences
which include coupled Schr\"odinger
              equations, travelling waves and
the non-linear Gross-Pitaevskii equation will
              be studied by
Profs. Choi, Koltracht and McKenna.
