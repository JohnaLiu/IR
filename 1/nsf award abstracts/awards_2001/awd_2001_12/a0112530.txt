Abstract    :
              	The 23rd Midwest Probability Colloquium will be held at the University of
              Chicago, on October 19-20, 2001. This is a regional meeting with a limited
              number of talks and plenty of opportunity for interaction among the
              researchers. It has a strong tradition of encouraging graduate students and
              other young investigators to attend and interact with specialists.
