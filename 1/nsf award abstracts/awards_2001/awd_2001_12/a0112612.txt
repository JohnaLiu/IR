Today, the overall performance of a multichip computing
              system is dominated by the limitations of the interconnections between chips
              and it is predicted that this problem will migrate to the single chip level
              within this decade.  Conventional interconnects rely on metal lines which
              produce increasingly unmanageable problems with speed and power
              dissipation.
Optical interconnects provide a solution to these problems. 
              However, one key problem that needs to be solved is the lack of a suitable
              laser that is fully compatible with silicon microelectronic
              manufacturing.

The possibility of achieving lasing in silicon will be
              investigated.  The conditions under which optical gain can be achieved in
              silicon nanocrystals will be established.  In particular, the nanocrystal size
              and surface passivation, especially with silicon-oxygen bonds, will be studied.
               Then, an optically pumped laser will be designed and tested.  The
              demonstration of an optically pumped silicon laser is the main objective of
              this work.  Once the conditions required to achieve gain are established, the
              conditions under which electrical pumping will be examined.

The results of
              this work will be of interest to the scientific community, as a silicon laser
              is commonly thought to be impossible, and to technologists, as the explosion in
              information technology relies on continued progress in computing power.
