              Abstract

ROVs, AUVs and other submarine robotic systems deliver quantitative
              data from sensors at a huge and escalating rate. Usually these data are stored
              for later processing and are viewed in real time as numbers flashing by on a
              screen. What is needed is a way to utilize these data more fully in real time
              to optimize the use of robotic vehicles for science. This proposal explores
              three ways of making progress on this goal. 1) develop interactive 3-D graphic
              interfaces for data display, 2) develop sensor-based macros for performing
              routine tasks such as surveys, docking, obstacle avoidance and other functions,
              3) Test the effect on mission performance of prioritizing data transmission
              over low-bandwidth acoustic channels, These will be developed on full-scale
              dynamically positioned vehicles and will extend the present capabilities of
              underwater robotic vehicles for more difficult and complex tasks.
