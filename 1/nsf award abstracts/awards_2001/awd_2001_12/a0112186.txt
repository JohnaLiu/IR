Abstract    :
              The investigators will produce a comprehensive picture of the coronal mass
              ejection (CME) phenomenon as viewed at radio wavelengths from lift-off at the
              sun through the response of the terrestrial magnetosphere to its passage. The
              main effort is to continue to synthesize radio data from the Wind and Ulysses
              spacecraft, SOHO coronagraph data, ground-based data, and corollary
              measurements from instruments monitoring the solar wind and energetic particle
              environment. The work builds on several significant advances made in a previous
              award from NSF. The investigators developed triangulation methods that permit
              investigators to track the sources of radio waves (CMEs and finite regions
              along their boundaries) as they move out from the sun long after they cease to
              be visible to SOHO instruments. With this technique, regions where the radio
              waves originate are identified to allow detailed study, using the multiple
              supporting datasets, of the physical processes that produce the waves.
