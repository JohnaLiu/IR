Abstract    :
               While hormonal responses to stress are well known, the mechanisms of neural
              
control in regulating such responses are not well understood.  An animal
              under 
stress shows increased blood levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone,
              ACTH.  
ACTH in turn stimulates steroidogenesis in the tissue of the adrenal
              cortex, which 
generates and releases corticosterone, a steroid glucocorticoid
              compound.  
However, there has been a long-standing problem that the patterns
              of ACTH 
levels in the blood often do not match changes in circulating
              glucocorticoid levels.  
Recent discoveries suggest that this steroidogenic
              response of the adrenal 
cortex also is regulated by activity of the
              splanchnic nerve coming from the spinal 
cord.  This renewal project combines
              physiological and molecular approaches to 
identify the mechanisms involved. 
              Experiments will test how blocking neural 
activity changes the expression of
              biochemical enzymes and receptor proteins 
that are part of the steroidogenic
              pathway, how neuronal stimulation might 
modulate changes by regulating
              adrenal blood flow, and which nerve fiber types 
(preganglionic sympathetic or
              primary afferent fibers) mediate the observed 
changes in steroidogenesis.
  
               Results will define a novel mechanism for regulation of hormone activity in
              
response to stress, which will have an impact on understanding neural control
              
systems in general, and can be important for management of stress in contexts
              
such as agriculture as well as human behavior.  The project also involves
              student 
training in state-of-the-art technology in a very productive
              laboratory.
