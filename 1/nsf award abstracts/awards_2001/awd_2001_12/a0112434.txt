Abstract    :
              This project develops, codes, and analyzes data from a comprehensive archive of
              organizational ethnographies.  The archive helps advance the field of the
              sociology of work by combining the strengths of both quantitative and
              qualitative methodologies.  The in-depth observations contained in ethnographic
              accounts of organization life provide rich qualitative information, and the
              systematic coding of those observations into scores appropriate for
              quantitative analysis provides the basis for more precise comparisons of
              otherwise separate case studies.  The topics studied by the project with the
              organizational ethnographies of work include:  1) co-worker relations involving
              race and gender relations and discrimination, 2) the role of information
              technology, 3) causes of job stress, 4) worker solidarity, unionization, and
              resistance, 5) workplace marginality, and 6) sources of high
              performance.

The project addresses these topics by adding data from 34
              recent ethnographies to an existing archive of 108 ethnographies.  Like data
              from the previously-archived ethnographies, which served as the basis for
              numerous  and influential publications, additional data for the archive come
              from codings based on content analysis of descriptive passages in the new
              ethnographies.  With the coded data, the analysis extensively evaluates the
              reliability and validity of the coding methods, and addresses relatively new
              workplace issues studied only by the most recent ethnographies.  In making the
              archive public, the project allows others to quantitatively analyze a variety
              of topics relating to work and organizations.
