Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Southern Methodist University will purchase a
              highshared memory machine.   . The equipment and software purchased with this
              grant will be used for five research projects involving seven faculty and five
              graduate students. These projects are: dynamics and instabilities in
              semiconductor lasers; modeling multiphase contaminant flows in porous media;
              parallel software for two-point boundary value problems; continuation methods
              for analyzing chemical pattern formation and multiscale methods for integral
              formulation of elliptic and parabolic equations.
