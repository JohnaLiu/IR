This Americas Program award will support Dr. Gary E.
              Mitchell, North Carolina State University in collaboration with Dr. Mahir
              Hussein of the Universidad de Sao Paulo in Brazil.  The aim of the project is
              to study quantum chaos through measurement of a system that mimics chaotic
              behavior - acoustic resonances in quartz blocks.  

By studying an
              experimental system exhibiting chaotic behavior, the researchers intend to
              address some open questions in quantum mechanics that may shed light on
              fundamental processes in nuclear physics.  The project will take advantage of a
              recently established experimental program in Sao Paulo and combine the
              expertise of the US group in analyzing nuclear spectra for signatures of
              quantum chaos.  The collaboration will have an educational component by
              promoting the exchange of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.
