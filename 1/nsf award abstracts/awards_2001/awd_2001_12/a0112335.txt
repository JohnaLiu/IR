Abstract    :
              The primary object of this project is the construction and analysis of
              mathematical models which introduce decoherence into the dynamics of a
              geometric quantum computer. A geometric quantum computer (GQC) is a particular
              proposal for a quantum computer which uses Berry's phase to encode the phase
              shift of the 2-qubit conditional-phase-shift logic-gate that generates
              entangled states in the GQC.  The goal of this type of investigation is to
              examine the robustness of geometric quantum computing to errors, in particular,
              the manner in which decoherence will degrade and ultimately ruin the
              performance of a GQC.
