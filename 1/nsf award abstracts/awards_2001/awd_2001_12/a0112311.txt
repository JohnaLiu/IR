Abstract    :
              This project develops methods that deal with estimation of economic models while
              imposing minimum plausible assumptions. In particular, the class of models that
              the project examines are defined in terms of inequality restrictions. These
              inequality restrictions arise in models with incomplete data (data that are
              censored or top-coded), in models with multiple equilibria, or in models with 
              measurement error, among others. The estimation techniques that are developed
              are applied first in estimation problems with interval data with endogeneity. 
              Second, the methods are used to obtain more robust inference in English auction
              models with bids data. Third, the methods are applied to nonlinear models with
              measurement error. The project will also examine  the issue of constructing
              valid tests that enables confidence regions for the estimated components of
              these models.
