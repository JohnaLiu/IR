Abstract    :
              The Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC) proposes to conduct a
              seminar for senior staff at science centers on project planning, proposal
              development and project management, including grant management.  The overall
              goal is to build capacity within science centers to develop and manage fundable
              projects consistent with the guidelines of the ISE program.  Presenters and
              discussants will include successful ISE PI's and reviewers.  ASTC will
              stipulate that participation requires teams comprised of a top-level
              decision-maker, project planner and a development officer or other cognizant
              team member from each institution.  Furthermore, teams from medium- and
              smaller-sized institutions will be encouraged to participate and given priority
              consideration.
