Abstract    :
              Duffy  0112532   The investigators will develop new theoretical techniques
              and conduct new high pressure and temperature experiments to examine the
              melting curves, crystal structures, and high-temperature equations of state
              (EOS) of the following materials: MgO, SiO2, MgSiO3, and Au.   They will
              accomplish this by developing a major extension of the density functional
              theory - molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) method and applying it to minerals of the
              Earth's deep mantle.  The approach is to develop empirical "optimal" potentials
              from the results of a DFT-MD simulation.  This optimal potential can then be
              used in further calculations involving much larger systems and longer run
              durations.  From this, the investigators can determine crystal structures,
              melting curves, liquid viscosities, compressibilities, elastic constants and
              other thermoelastic properties directly at lower mantle P-T conditions. They
              will also carry out detailed comparison of their simulation results with
              laser-heated synchrotron experiments on MgO, SiO2, and Au to assess the
              reliability of the OP method. In particular, they will focus on measurements of
              melting curves of these materials at high pressure to provide a sensitive test
              of the optimal potential calculations.
