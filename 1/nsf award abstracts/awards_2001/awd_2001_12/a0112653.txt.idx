Abstract    :
              The objectives of this project are (1) to simultaneously design optimization
              methods and subsurface flow and transport simulators for a variety of
              subsurface contaminant remediation problems, (2) to implement the
              optimization-simulation combination in a way that exploits parallelism in both
              the optimization and simulation, including some ideas for grid-based
              implementations of search-poll type methods, (3) to apply the new algorithms to
              two demonstration problems, (4) to train a generation of students in this
              multidisciplinary setting.  Two of the PIs, Dennis and Kelley, have expertise
              in a wide range of optimization technology, both gradient-based methods for
              smooth problems and sampling methods for problems for which gradients are not
              available.  Kelley and Miller have a long-standing collaboration in numerical
              methods for simulation of multi-phase flow.  The PIs will exploit this
              expertise and design the simulators and optimization algorithms simultaneously.
               There will be IT-centered activity in software.  Two codes, FOCUS and IFFCO,
              are under development by the principal investigators.  The most mature of
              these, IFFCO an implicit filtering optimization code, will be ported to MPI
              from PVM, packaged for ease of installation and testing, documented as a book,
              and released in final form.  The PIs will also continue to develop FOCUS, an
              implementation of the surrogate management framework ideas.  Remediation of
              subsurface contamination is an important issue world-wise. The goal is to clean
              up, or render immobile, underground contaminants such as fuel spills from
              underground tanks or industrial waste from leaking drums, and do this at
              minimum cost.  Management decisions must be made, and the potential financial
              penalty of bad decisions is great.  Mathematical models of subsurface systems
              are often used to assist in making such decisions and these models are
              increasingly linked with optimization approaches to aid design and management
              decision making.  Subsurface remediation strategies involve decisions such as
              the restoration approach to use, the selection of locations to install devices,
              such as wells, and the rates of extraction from or injection into these wells. 
              There are open scientific problems in simulation related to fundamental
              modeling and choice of numerical methods that need to be addressed as part of
              the design of software to optimize the remediation methods.  The three PIs have
              expertise in simulation, modeling, and experimental work in multi-phase flows
              as well as broad expertise in optimization methods.  The objectives of this
              project are to design models, simulators, and optimization methods
              simultaneously with the goal of more efficient optimal design based on more
              accurate models.
