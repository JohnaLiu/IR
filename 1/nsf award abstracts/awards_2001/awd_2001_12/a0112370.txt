Abstract    :
              
This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support investigation examines how the
              federal structure of American political institutions affects the way in which
              individuals translate policy opinions into voting behavior. A theoretical
              framework pays particular attention to citizens' ability to make different
              attributions of responsibility for policymaking and policy performance across
              different levels of government in a federal system. Specific hypotheses focus
              on the affect such responsibility attributions have on the linkage between
              policy opinions and federal voting behavior. The hypothesized relationships
              will be analyzed by collecting original survey data on citizen attitudes about
              various policy areas and the level of governments they deem responsible for
              those policies.

This dissertation has implications for understanding
              empirical patterns of American federal voting that heretofore have been
              understudied. The model produces specific predictions regarding those who would
              be more likely to vote for different parties at different levels of government
              and for those who turnout for lower offices, but not higher ones.
