Abstract    :
              0112923 Niu  Driven by both consumer and commercial needs, the Internet is
              becoming mobile and broadband, thus allowing the user high speed access to the
              world wide web from their cell phones and other wireless devices. Optical
              networking and mobile communication are the key enabling technologies for a
              mobile and broad-band Internet. Because of its high performance, low cost, and
              compatibility with silicon CMOS, SiGe HBT technology has recently emerged as a
              contender for both mobile and optical networking applications. Current SiGe
              HBTs designs are focused on improving the speed of these devices, while our
              recent experiments have shown that the optimum device structure for wireless
              applications are considerably different. Issues important for mobile and
              optical networking, such as 1/f noise, phase noise (frequency domain sideband
              and time domain jitter), and linearity, have not been researched as a function
              of the device structure, or optimized for these performance targets.  This
              ITR proposal is aimed at systematically examining the impact of bandgap
              engineering and scaling on all of the device figures-of-merit that are of
              interest to wireless and optical communication IC's, and use of these results
              to optimize the SiGe profiles and geometries for various circuit applications.
              In the process, scientifically intriguing and technologically important
              questions, such as why SiGe HBTs with a nonlinear I-V can have excellent
              linearity, will be answered. This is a brand new area of SiGe device research,
              and has a high potential payoff given the exploding industry interest in
              applying SiGe technology to wireless and optical networking systems. The
              outcome will include a scientific understanding of important open questions on
              SiGe HBTs, a modification of the design approach and methodology, as well as
              hardware demonstration of the novel SiGe profiles through our close
              collaboration with IBM, thus ensuring a timely impact on current and future
              development in SiGe technology. Given the enormous amount of interest in
              applying SiGe technology to both wireless and optical networking applications,
              the PIs will develop an advanced course on SiGe HBTs using WebCT, so that the
              outcome of the proposed research can be remotely accessed by graduate students
              and practicing engineers in industry.
