The creation of an on-line Virtual
              Kinetic Laboratory (VKLab), an integrated web-based problem-solving environment
              with visualization and experimental data verification for research and
              education in reaction kinetics, is proposed. The specific objectives for the
              proposed period are 1) to design the VKLab server page and infrastructure; 2)
              to develop a chemical information management system for storage and retrieval
              of structural and thermodynamic properties of molecular species, and kinetic
              properties of chemical reactions; 3) to develop tools for calculating
              thermodynamic properties of individual molecules and reactions by using the
              user-supplied potential energy surface or group-additivity approach; 3) to
              develop ab initio dynamics tools for calculating both temperature and pressure
              dependent rate constants of elementary reactions; 4) to develop an automatic
              mechanism generation of complex reactions; 5) to interface VKLab with existing
              tools for mechanism sensitivity analysis and reduction.  Successful development
              of VKLab will provide an environment in which researchers and students in
              science or engineering can perform research or learn computational methods in
              chemical thermodynamics and reaction kinetics, access information, and
              computational resources regardless of physical and geographic location, age,
              physical limitation, and personal schedule.
