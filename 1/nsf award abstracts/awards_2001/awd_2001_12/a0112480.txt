This award provides partial funding for the operation and
               maintenance of the Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement Laboratory (PRIME Lab), a
              multi-user national facility supported by NSF to provide  accelerator-based
              mass spectrometry (AMS) capabilities in measuring the cosmogenic nuclides 10Be,
              14C, 26Al, 36Cl, 41Ca, and 129I for the  U.S. research community.  The
              technical goals of the facility are to develop and calibrate methods for the
              analysis of very low concentrations of cosmogenic radionuclides found in
              natural samples.  The analytical data are used in tracer and geochronological
              methods applied to studies of the geological history of rocks, soils, ground
              water and extraterrestrial  materials.
