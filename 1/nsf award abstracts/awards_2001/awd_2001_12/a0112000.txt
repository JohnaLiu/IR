Abstract    :
              This award to Penn State University from the Office of Multidisciplinary
              Activities in MPS is to support a Workshop entitled" Analytical Instrumentation
              for the New Millennium- Materials" to be held March 2-3, 2001 in New Orleans,
              LA.

Materials research is becoming an increasingly interdisciplinary field,
              with strong links to chemistry and biological sciences. The availability of new
              tools for materials characterization has in large measure transformed the field
              over the course of the last decade.

The Workshop will bring together 45
              scientists from academia, industry, and national laboratories who are makers of
              new materials, developers of characterization tools, and users of these new
              tools. The Workshop will seek to provide a forward-looking assessment of major
              opportunities in materials research where innovative new instrumentation could
              make significant contributions. It will also identify existing techniques or
              technologies in which significant increase in sensitivity and /or resolution
              could contribute substantively to progress in materials research. The Workshop
              will provide a written report with recommendations on how the community - both
              academic and private sectors - working in partnership with the federal support
              structure could facilitate the development of new instrumentation and the
              training of the next generation of scientists to creatively use these new
              tools.
