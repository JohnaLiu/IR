              ABSTRACT  Information Technology Research (ITR)  Small
              Proposal   Proposal Id:  EIA-0112688 Investigator:  Denis Lee Institution:
               Suffolk University Title:   ITR/PE: Knowledge Acquisition and Effective
              Development of Information Technologies/Systems Workers  This award provides
              support for a 3-year research study to examine the changing knowledge and skill
              requirements for different types of Information Technology (IT) /Information
              Systems (IS) work.  It will investigate how IT/IS workers acquire the knowledge
              and information they need for their work and how they coordinate their work
              effort with colleagues.  It will analyze various important mechanisms that
              might facilitate or inhibit these processes.  Finally it will also relate these
              work-based learning behaviors of IT/IS workers to their demographic and
              educational background as well as to performances, professional development and
              turnover.
