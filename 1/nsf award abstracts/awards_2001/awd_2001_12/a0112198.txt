Abstract    :
              This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support investigation examines the factors
              that affect citizen trust in government.  The investigator attempts to build a
              complete theory of trust in govermnent.  This is done by assuming trust
              operates as a public decision and that trust will be the result of public
              information and public disposition.  Citizen trust in their government will
              vary depending on information about government performance and dispositions of
              ideology, party identification and social capital that are used to interpret
              that information.
The theory and hypotheses are tested by using a quarterly
              measure of trust in government for the period 1972 to 2000.  This measure of
              trust in government demonstrates that trust in governmnent varies on a regular
              basis.   The investigator also attempts to assess the effect of trust in
              government on political participation, voter turnout and elections.
