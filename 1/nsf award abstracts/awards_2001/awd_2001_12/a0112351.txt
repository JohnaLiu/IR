Abstract    :
              
The Department of Applied Mathematics at the Illinois Institute of Technology
              will purchase a customized Linux cluster which will be dedicated to the support
              of research in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for
              several research projects, including in particular:

1. Further Development
              of the W-Curve as a Visualization and analytic Tool for the study of Long
              Genomic sequences, by Douglas J. Cork and F.R. McMorris;

2. Numerical
              simulation of stochastic Partial Differential Equations in Fluid Dynamics, by
              Jinqiao Duan;

3. Parallel algorithms for Meshless Methods, by Gregory
              Fasshauer;

4. Numerical Investigations of Interfacial Dynamics in Fluid
              Dynamics, by Xiaofan Li.
