Abstract    :
              A network effect exists when an agent values a good based on how many other
              agents use the good.  For instance, consumers choosing between VHS and Beta
              VCR's are unlikely to choose based on superior technical performance.  Instead,
              consumers choose the standard that other consumers choose, most likely in order
              to have access to a large library of pre-recorded movies.  Network effects are
              present in many markets and are especially important for many high technology
              and information technology goods.  Network goods can lead to market outcomes
              that present difficult problems for public policy.  This project studies two
              such outcomes:  The first is that a market can coordinate on a single
              proprietary good, leading to market power for the owner of the good.  The
              second is that markets can fail to coordinate, so consumers are unsure of which
              standard will ultimately be adopted.  Such confusion can lead to very slow
              adoption rates for new products.   This project analyzes two specific
              industries that exhibit these problems.  The project works through estimation
              issues that arise in the face of network effects and uses the results of the
              estimation to analyze the implications for government intervention into those
              markets, either by antitrust or standard setting.    The first part of the
              project estimates the importance of a positive feedback loop in the market for
              Yellow Pages advertising. I estimate how much consumers prefer directories with
              more advertising and how much advertisers are willing to pay to advertise in a
              directory with more readers.  I use resulting estimates to consider whether the
              market benefits from monopoly (which takes advantage of network effects) or
              oligopoly (which reduces market power).  The preliminary estimates imply that a
              more competitive market is preferable.  This result supports recent policy
              promoting competition in the directory market.  Furthermore, techniques
              developed here could be usefully applied to other markets.  For instance, just
              as consumers and advertisers prefer to coordinate on a single directory,
              consumers and software developers prefer to coordinate on a single operating
              system.    A drawback of my results from the Yellow Pages market is that the
              estimates predict unreasonably high benefits from adding directories to the
              market.  This problem is a common one when using discrete choice models.  The
              second part of this project (which is joint work with Daniel Ackerberg, UCLA)
              proposes a new estimator that captures the fact that as products enter a
              market, products become more similar with regards to characteristics that are
              unobservable to the researcher.  Our research presents structural
              justifications of the estimator as well as Monte Carlo studies of when the
              estimator is most appropriate.  This estimator has many applications, and the
              application of this technique to the Yellow Pages market should lead to more
              accurate estimates, both of the strength of the network effect and of the
              welfare tradeoffs between competition and standardization.  The third part of
              the project is joint work with Angelique Augereau (McKinsey) and Shane
              Greenstein (Kellogg).  We analyze the introduction of high-speed modems and how
              the market failed to coordinate on a single standard.  Originally, two
              competing but equivalent standards of 56K modems led to a situation in which
              consumers and Internet service providers had to coordinate their choice of
              modem technology.   Overall, adoption was very slow and eventually, an industry
              group developed a single standard that was widely adopted. Our explanation of
              the slow initial adoption rate is that, in contrast to the incentives to
              coordinate, ISP's also have an incentive to differentiate across the two
              standards because doing so reduces price competition. Consumers then postpone
              adoption because they do not know which standard will "win".  We develop a
              theoretical model that formalizes these points.  In addition, preliminary
              empirical analysis suggests that, before the arrival of the new standard,
              adopting ISP choices were evenly distributed between the two standards even
              within individual markets.  As our theory predicts, ISP's perfectly
              differentiated instead of coordinated.  We use insights and results from the
              study of this market to discuss the competitive determination of adoption
              choice and implications for the benefits of intervention into a standards
              war.
