Abstract    :
              INTERPHASE is a series of meetings, devoted mainly to numerical and
              computational aspects of free boundary problems, which have been held
              successfully once a year in Europe for the past 8 years.  The apparent
              misspelling of INTERPHASE is supposed to emphasize the chief purpose of this
              meeting: facilitate the communication and exchange of ideas and methods between
              communities (`phases') of scientists and engineers that otherwise may not
              interact and thus profit from each other.  In fact, interfaces arise in a
              variety of applications from materials science and fluid dynamics, to image
              processing and finance, which may not have any common roots and goals but
              however are described by similar partial differential equations and thereby
              present analogous difficulties, challenges, and methodology.

The 9th
              conference of the series will be held in College Park, MD, in September 2001
              with the intention of encouraging more participation of US researchers and
              stimulating the exchange of ideas between American and European peers in the
              area of problems where there is an interface between regions of interest.  We
              plan to have about 30 senior speakers, 12 junior speakers, and a poster
              session.
