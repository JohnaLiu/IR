Abstract    :
              The ability to assimilate data into models/simulations has been shown to be
              critical when dealing with complex systems such as weather.  The Earth's
              magnetosphere forms part of the space weather system, and it is necessary that
              data assimilation techniques be developed for magnetospheric simulations.  This
              project will investigate two approaches to magnetospheric data assimilation. 
              The first is a statistical regression method termed 'optimal interpolation' and
              the second approach is Kalman filtering.
