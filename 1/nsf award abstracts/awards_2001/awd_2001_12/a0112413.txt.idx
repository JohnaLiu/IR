Abstract    :
                     The Scientific Computation Group (Scicomp) in the Mathematics    
              Department at UCSD will purchase a 16-processor MPI-based parallel    
              computer and four Linux-based graphics workstations for visualization.     The
              equipment will be dedicated to the support of research in the     mathematical
              sciences.  The equipment will be used for several research     projects,
              including parallel adaptive multilevel finite element methods,     parallel
              algorithms for optimal control with PDE constraints, parallel     level set
              algorithm development, and applications in biochemistry and     physics.    
                   Supported by this computing equipment, our research program will    
              provide graduate students and postdocs a broad educational experience     in
              an environment in which different aspects of scientific computation     are
              integrated.  This produces scientists who are not only expert in     their own
              area of study, but are also able to communicate across     disciplinary
              boundaries.          As part of this proposal, SDSC (San Diego Supercomputer
              Center)     will provide fiber-optic infrastructure to connect the
              16-processor     parallel computer to a similar large cluster located at SDSC.
               The     coupled clusters will be used in large production calculations    
              requiring substantial resources, and the individual Scicomp cluster     will
              be used for parallel algorithm development and for smaller     production
              calculations.  The Scicomp satellite with fiber link to     SDSC will
              complement similar computational satellites recently     constructed by the
              biochemistry group on campus and by the UCSD     Medical School.
