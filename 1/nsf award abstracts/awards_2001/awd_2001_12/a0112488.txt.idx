Abstract    :
              With the rapid growth in the amount of information resources and transaction
              opportunities on the Internet, Internet use is becoming an important dimension
              of social inequality.  Among those who will be significantly affected by this
              social and technological trend, the situation of women calls for special
              attention because new technologies may not necessarily lead to significant
              beneficial changes in their everyday lives as suggested by past studies on
              women's urban experiences and interaction with new technologies.  This research
              analyzes the impact of Internet use on women's activity patterns and the gender
              division of household labor.  It attempts to answer the following questions:
              (a) Is Internet use helping to relax some of women's space-time constraints,
              thus allowing more flexible spatial and temporal arrangement of activities in
              the physical world and helping women to cope with the demand of their multiple
              roles?  (b) How do women's Internet activities affect their activities in the
              physical world?  (c) How does the Internet use of the female and male heads of
              household affect the gender division of household labor?  To answer these
              questions, data from a sample of women in Columbus, Ohio, will be collected
              through an activity-Internet diary survey.  Hypotheses will be tested through
              comparing the experiences of women with different levels of Internet use using
              structural equation models.  Geographic information System-based
              three-dimensional visualization will also be used to analyze the space-time
              activity-Internet diary data.   The study will enhance our understanding of
              the impact of Internet use on women's activity patterns and the gender division
              of household labor.  The results will be useful for formulating social and
              economic policies in several important areas.  For example, sustainable
              transportation policies aiming at reducing the amount of travel through
              telecommuting need to be informed by such understanding.  If women's many needs
              to travel cannot be substituted by working at home using the Internet (e.g.
              chauffeuring children), encouraging women's telecommuting will neither reduce
              traffic nor their stress in everyday life.  Further, this research will have
              significant implications for economic policies aiming at promoting electronic
              commerce and the use of the Internet.  If the use of the Internet reinforces
              the existing gender division of household labor rather than engenders more
              equitable gender relations, appropriate economic policies may be needed to
              compromise the goal of reducing gender inequality in society at large.
