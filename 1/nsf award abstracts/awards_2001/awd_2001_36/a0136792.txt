Abstract    :
              This project will study how tax incentives affect the structure of household
              portfolios.  One strand of research will explore the determinants of asset
              allocation patterns in tax-deferred and taxable accounts.  The recent growth of
              employee participation in 401(k) plans, and the coincident expansion in the
              number of households with Individual Retirement Accounts, has raised new
              portfolio choices for many households.  This research will investigate the
              extent to which households consider tax factors in structuring their portfolios
              by comparing asset allocation decisions in taxable and tax-deferred settings. 
              It will also develop new information on the potential distribution of balances
              in tax-deferred accounts when current savers reach retirement.  The research
              will bear on the ongoing discussion concerning the adequacy of household
              retirement saving and thus will have broader impacts on both the financial and
              the public policy sectors.
        
A second strand of research will explore
              the recent growth of variable annuity products.   It will evaluate how tax
              incentives affect the demand for these financial products, and test the
              hypothesis that the households with the largest incentives to hold variable
              annuities purchase these products.  This research will also consider the
              potential role of these products in helping retirees to draw down the balances
              that they accumulate in 401(k) plans and other retirement saving vehicles.
