Abstract    :
              This proposal will field a multi-method study of gender disparities in response
              to household economic crises (e.g., illness, floods, unemployment) among poor
              households in Lucknow, India.  Survey data will be collected in four waves over
              a two and a half year panel design in order to obtain before and after measures
              of responses to crises.  Household assets and decision making power will be
              evaluated at each wave.  Qualitative data will be collected at the beginning
              and end of the field work.  Household and individual-level data will be
              supplemented by community level focus groups exploring the key risk factors and
              community resources available to respond to those risks.  Individual assets
              within the household are expected to be a determinant of who suffers most from
              crises, but gender differences are also expected to play an independent role.
