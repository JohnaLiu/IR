Monthly mean data from 1993 thru 1999 will be used to
              determine whether the spatio-temporal variability of fields of warm water
              volume and sea surface height estimated from satellite altimetry in the
              tropical/subtropical Pacific are correlated.  The pathways of warm water
              variability will be determined, since it is not clear that the mean Subtropical
              Cells and the variations about the mean follow the same pathways.
