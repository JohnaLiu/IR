Abstract    :
              Natural ecosystems perform fundamental services that are essential for
              sustaining human populations.  Ecosystem services arise from complex
              interactions between natural cycles and ecological processes, and could cost
              human societies trillions of dollars annually to replace.  Because human
              population growth and consumption cause the continued alteration of natural
              ecosystems, identifying and monitoring ecosystem services is a critical natural
              resource need for sound environmental decision-making. This research project
              focuses on the ecosystem services provided by floodplain forests
              ---specifically, how floodplain forests remove phosphate (a common pollutant)
              from floodwaters, converting it to a less harmful form prior to export
              downstream.  One consequence of the development of natural ecosystems for
              agriculture or human habitation is an increase in phosphate exports to aquatic
              ecosystems.  Because phosphate can cause the eutrophication of these aquatic
              ecosystems, understanding how floodplain forests convert phosphate to less
              harmful forms is an important component of understanding the ecosystem services
              that improve water quality.
