This project will produce a lexical database and associated
              dictionary of Tanacross, an Athabascan language spoken in eastern interior
              Alaska.  Tanacross is among the least documented of the Alaska Athabascan
              languages, and no previous lexical documentation project has been undertaken. 
              Data will be collected both via elicitation and from recorded texts and
              compiled into a lexical database.  This database will be used to generate a
              printed dictionary and will serve as the basis for an electronic version of the
              dictionary.  The resulting dictionary and database will contribute both to our
              understanding of the Athabascan family of languages and to ongoing Tanacross
              language revitalization efforts.
