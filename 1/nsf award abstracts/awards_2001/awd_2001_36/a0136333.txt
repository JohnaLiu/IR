              ABSTRACT

OCE-0136333

Adsorption and solution complexation exert important
              controls on the fluxes and distributions of trace metals in the oceans. 
              However, to understand metal ion adsorptive behavior requires that the solution
              chemistry be well characterized.  Considering that yttrium and the rare earth
              elements (YREEs) have solution chemistries that are known and are influenced by
              the same processes that influence other metals in seawater makes them ideally
              suited to studies of metal ion adsorptive behavior.  For this reason, two PIs
              from the University of South Florida propose to carry out a series of
              laboratory experiments to determine the adsorption characteristics of YREEs as
              a function of particle type and solution chemistry.  For particle type, the PIs
              plan to utilize -MnO2, a-FeOOH, a-Al2O3, amorphous SiO2, calcite, aragonite,
              Ulva lactuca (living/non-living algae) and natural suspended matter collected
              in the Gulf of Mexico.  The study will use both synthetic solutions and natural
              seawater.  Results from this research will provide an improved understanding of
              processes that exert dominant control on the distribution of reactive metals in
              seawater.
