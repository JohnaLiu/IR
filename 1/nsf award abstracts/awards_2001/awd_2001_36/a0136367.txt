              ABSTRACT

OCE-0136367


The marine chemistry of trace metals, their
              complexation with ligands, and their interactions with phytoplankton are
              intimately linked with the cycling of sulfur.  In particular trace metal
              speciation may be profoundly influenced by various forms of reduced sulfur
              (sulfides), even in the oxygen-rich surface ocean.  While sulfides may be
              produced by the microbial reduction of dissolved sulfate, there is also
              abundant evidence that some species of phytoplankton may also produce both
              dissolved and particulate sulfide.  

In this study, researchers at Old
              Dominion University will conduct a thorough examination of the rates and
              mechanisms of hydrogen sulfide production by marine phytoplankton using an
              iterative laboratory- and field-based approach.  They will measure the rates of
              production of dissolved and particulate sulfide by a number of coastal and
              oceanic species in continuous culture and examine the influence of variable
              light, nutrient, and trace metal levels.  Additionally they will assess the
              utility of sulfur isotope measurements in the quantification of biotic and
              abiotic production of hydrogen sulfide.  The laboratory studies will be
              compared to field measurements.  The research team expects to elucidate and
              quantify the principal mechanisms of production of both dissolved and
              particulate sulfide and to assess the implications for the cycling of trace
              metals in surface waters.
