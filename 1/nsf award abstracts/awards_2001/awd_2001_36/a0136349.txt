Abstract    :
              The Climate Research Committee (CRC) of the Board on Atmospheric Sciences and
              Climate (BASC) of the National Academy of Sciences is conducting a special
              study on the major uncertainties associated with climate change feedbacks. 
              This award will enable an enlargement of the study panel to include experts in
              climate research beyond the specific members of the CRC.  It will support a
              major workshop plus follow-on correspondence, meetings and report
              writing.

This subject is important to NSF and other federal science agencies
              because it will enable better informed planning of climate change research
              agendas.
