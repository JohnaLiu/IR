Abstract    :
                 In mammals, puberty is a time of increasing hormonal secretions as well as
              developing reproductive abilities.  Associated changes occur in brain
              structures involved in these activities, and recent evidence shows that other
              parts of the brain involved in cognitive, non-reproductive functions also
              change structural features during puberty.  This project uses anatomical and
              pharmacological approaches to examine how cellular numbers and membrane
              receptor molecules may change during puberty in non-reproductive areas of the
              brain.  Ovarian hormone effects are measured in the visual cortex and in the
              hippocampus, which is a region known to be essential for many types of learning
              and memory.  Potential cellular mechanisms such as programmed cell death and
              types of hormone receptors are studied to see how critically they depend on
              timing of the hormone action, compared to the traditional perinatal 'critical
              periods.'
    Results will have substantial impact on understanding this
              little-studied but dynamic period related to reproductive and cognitive
              development, by exploring changes uniquely at the cellular level.  The impact
              will extend beyond neuroendocrinology to the fields of biology of aging,
              comparative neuroanatomy, and developmental neuroscience.  In addition,
              students will receive excellent research training in a lab that continues an
              excellent record of training and productivity.
