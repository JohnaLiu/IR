Alaska and Northwestern Canada are home to more than half of
              the Athabascan languages, and in these areas Athabascan communities have shown
              increasing interest in language revitalization.  At the same time, the
              Athabascan languages present unique challenges to linguists seeking to develop
              lexical databases.  The 2002 Athabascan Languages Conference, with an
              accompanying workshop on lexicography, will be held in Fairbanks, Alaska, in an
              effort to unite linguists, Native speakers, educators, and language learners in
              a rich information exchange.  The sessions will be focused on linguistic
              research, language revitalization, and language policy.  Stipends will be
              available for students and Native speakers from the Alaskan interior and
              Northwestern Canada.
