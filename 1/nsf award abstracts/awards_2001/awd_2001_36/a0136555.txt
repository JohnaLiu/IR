              Government:  Improving Statistical Literacy Through FedStats

This grant will
              support a planning process to develop concepts for research in user interfaces
              and forms of on-line learning and analysis to improve statistical literacy for
              the citizen.  The proposer will work with an existing group of collaborating
              Federal statistical agencies, know as FedStats.  FedStats has an award-winning
              web site, and collaborates with several Digital Government grantees; they are
              the appropriate agencies to engage in this work.
