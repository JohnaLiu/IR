This project traces the history of research
              on protein structure in the period between 1930-1980, as a major scientific
              problem in the 20 th Century, underlying not only the structural origins of
              molecular biology but also key aspects of biotechnology, most notably its most
              recent frontier in proteomics. The project documents in extensive archival
              detail three key stages of the international quest for protein structure: 
              

1.   The theoretical debates of the 1930s which cast the scientific problem
              of protein  structure in the context of historical movements, most notably
              British socialism, communism, and anti-fascism; the intellectual migration
              forced by Nazism and totalitarianism in central Europe; and American
              philanthropy's efforts to contain social unrest during the Great Depression.
              The novel aspect of this phase pertains to its documentation of the crucial
              process of arbitration, conducted by a dozen scientists from US, UK,
              Scandinavia, Holland, France, Switzerland. The project explains the
              arbitrator's failure to contain the debate or accomplish a "sociopolitical
              partition of truth" among the three main contenders.

2. The competition over
              models in the early 1950s, culminating with the British model 1950 and the
              American model of 1951, the latter known as the alpha-helix. This competition
              captures the post-WW2 shift of political scenery (especially the Cold War
              atmosphere which led to denial of visas to key protein researchers to visit the
              US or the UK. The project further explains why this stage had major
              consequences for the subsequent overshadowing of protein structure by DNA
              structure as the hot topic in the rise of molecular biology.

3.  The
              empirical races over full molecular solutions in the 1960s and 1970s (e.g.
              lysozyme solved in 1965 by a team at the Royal Institution; and ribonuclease,
              solved by teams at the Brooklyn Polytech and Birkbeck College, London. The
              project explains the role of large scale government funding and team research
              in molecular biology in the 1960s, as a prelude to current day scaling up into
              proteomics.

This project provides a better understanding of international
              cooperation and competition over half a century, especially over the complex
              period divided by WW2.  It also illuminates interdisciplinary research, a major
              feature of 20th Century science. Last, it explains proteomics, a current
              scientific frontier that goes beyond genomics into systematic research on the
              rational design of complex, megamolecular drugs.
