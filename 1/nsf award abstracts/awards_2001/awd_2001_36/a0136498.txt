In environmental magnetic studies, the magnetic
              properties of sediments and soils are used as tracers of paleoclimatic and
              other environmental processes.  The automated long-core cryogenic magnetometer
              in the Paleomagnetism Laboratory at UC-Davis has been designated by NSF as a
              national facility for environmental magnetic research.  This grant will provide
              support for a laboratory manager whose primary responsibilities will be to
              oversee the operations of this facility, to develop new applications for the
              long-core magnetometer and new methods of analyzing the data generated by it,
              and to facilitate the use of the instrument by outside users.
