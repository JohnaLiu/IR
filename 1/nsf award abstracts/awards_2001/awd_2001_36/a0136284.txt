This two-year award for US-Italy collaboration on comparative
              research on agricultural land-use history and forest management involves Gil
              Latz of Portland State University and Mauro Agnoletti of the University of
              Florence, Italy.  The research will include comparative study of policies and
              legal instruments for conserving sites, and evaluation of opportunities and
              master planning for sustainable forestry and agriculture. In particular, the
              research will focus on Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques for
              construction of a multipurpose land-use map of the Spanocchia estate and its
              comparison to the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller (MBR) National Historical Park,
              and on proposals for possible conservation options.  

The US researcher
              brings to this collaboration expertise in sustainable management of forest
              parks, focusing on historic land-use patterns and forest management practices
              that have been restored.  This is complemented by Italian expertise in the
              creation of a topographic database and a digital model of the territory,
              digitization of the Tuscan Cadastre of 1832 and aerial and remote sensing
              information, and field work to check aerial interpretations. The results of
              this research are expected to contribute to contemporary forest certification
              policy, by gauging the impact of historical information.  These results are
              expected to be particularly useful to subsequent analysis, comparison, and
              dissemination of strategies for sustainable forest management to a broad public
              of policy managers and landowners throughout the world.
