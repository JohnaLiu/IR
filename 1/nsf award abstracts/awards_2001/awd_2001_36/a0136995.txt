Abstract    :
              	This research will investigate how the largest Hungarian firms have altered
              their ownership structures during the rapid economic change between 1989 and
              2000.  Monthly data are available for approximately 1800 firms on changes in
              the leading owners, top management, product lines, capital sources, and
              operating locations.   The ownership data define network ties among the firms. 
              Network analytic methods will be used to study changes in a firm's position in
              the network structure and in the network structure itself. Sequence analysis
              will be used to study how firms adjust the types of ownership structure (e.g.,
              single owner, partial bank ownership) in response to political and market
              uncertainties.
