Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this workshop was to bring together some of the leading
              experts in complex silicon-level microsystems with key leaders from the
              molecular devices community to provide some initial thoughts on how to develop
              future answers to the following questions:  - How can molecular level
              interactions driving such systems be expressed in more abstract ways, how can
              these abstractions be translated into "primitive" building blocks, and how
              should modeling and design tools be built to emphasize such interactions?  -
              How does one develop new design strategies for combining such primitive
              building blocks into larger functional subsystems and then scale into even
              larger molecular systems, what might some of these design strategies entail,
              and what might be lifted from our experiences with silicon?  - What needs to
              surround a new technology to allow it to scale into complete, designable,
              complex sys-tems that can communicate with the outside, including legacy
              technologies such as silicon?  -  What are long term potentials for such
              technologies, as seen by complex system architects?  -  Where can they help
              solve bottlenecks that exist in current silicon technology microsystems? - Are
              there new models of computation or system design for which these new
              technologies are particu-larly well suited?   Given that the bulk of the
              attendees were primarily architects of computational silicon microsystems, a
              second objective of the workshop was to re-energize the computer architecture
              community to develop alter-native or mixed models of computation, new
              microarchitectural techniques, design tools and approaches for both the new
              technologies, mixes of old and new, and even port back into silicon. A final
              objective was to help both the system architecture and the new technology
              communities begin to develop the dialogs necessary to advance such technologies
              in a timely manner, and maximize the Government's investments in new programs
              such as NSF's Molecular Architecture Initiative.
