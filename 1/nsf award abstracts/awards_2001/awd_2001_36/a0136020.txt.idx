Abstract    :
              Workshop on Mitigating the Vulnerability of Critical Infrastructures to
              Catastrophic Failures  Critical infrastructures form the backbone of the
              economies of both the developed and the developing countries throughout the
              world.  They include electric power networks, fuel networks, water networks,
              transportation networks, telecommunications networks, and computer networks to
              cite a few. Assessing and mitigating their vulnerability to catastrophic
              failures call for the development of a new body of knowledge that integrates in
              a unified manner and builds on concepts and methodologies pertaining to many
              engineering and scientific fields.  Interdependencies between critical
              infrastructures were addressed by the OSTP/NSF workshop held in June 2001,
              which was entitled "Critical Infrastructures: Needs in Interdisciplinary
              Research and Graduate Training."  While this workshop highlighted the need of
              multi-disciplinary research work in critical infrastructure protection, major
              failures in electric power systems, telecommunications networks, and computer
              networks were not discussed and analyzed.   This is the focus of the workshop
              that will be held at the Lyceum, in Alexandria, Virginia, on September 10-11,
              2001, under the joint patronage of the National Science Foundation (NSF), the
              International Institute for Critical National Infrastructures (CRIS), the World
              Institute for Disaster Risk Management (DRM), and the International Institute
              for Information Technology (IIIT).  This workshop will bring together about
              forty experts in critical infrastructures and disaster risk management from
              North America, Europe, and Asia.  It will give them the opportunity to discuss
              various emerging concepts such as hidden failure, vulnerability, cascading
              failure, interdependency, risk assessment, and self-healing, among others, and
              identify research topics aimed at laying out the foundation of a new field of
              expertise dealing with the vulnerability of interdependent critical
              infrastructures.  Key speakers will be invited to give presentations and to
              submit position papers.  Proceedings will be issued in an electronic form and
              posted on several web sites that are popular among researchers and engineers of
              the critical infrastructure and disaster risk management communities.
