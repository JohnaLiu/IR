Abstract    :
              The U.S. mathematical and phycial sciences communities are represented by the
              Naitonal Academy of Sciences (NAS) in seven international scientific unions:
              the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the International Radio Science
              Union (URSI), the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), the
              International Commission for Optics (ICO), the International Union of Pure and
              Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr),
              and the International Mathematical Union (IMU). U.S. National Committees
              (USNC's), staffed by the NAS, coordinate U.S. preparations for meetings of the
              corresponding international unions and for scientific conferences, symposia,
              and workshops organized by these unions to identify research topics, issues,
              and programs of interest to their specific disciplines; identify and support
              U.S. scientists to participate in union activities; and arrange for payment of
              U.S. dues to the seven unions.

This award provides resources to underwrite
              the costs of these activities through CY 2003.
