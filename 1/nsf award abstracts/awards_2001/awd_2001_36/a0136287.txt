Abstract    :
              The Householder Symposium gathers the world's most active researchers in
              numerical linear algebra once every three years to review advances in the
              field, present recent theoretical and practical results, assess where the field
              is headed in the near future, and to provide an intimate atmosphere to foster
              close personal interaction and exchange of ideas.  

This project supports
              the travel of junior U.S. researchers to the 15th Householder Symposium on
              Numerical Linear Algebra to be held June 17 - 21, 2002 in Peebles, Scotland. 
              The funds are for travel expenses for U.S. graduate students and recent Ph.D.s
              who would otherwise be unable to attend.  The NSF funds will permit full
              participation by the most promising junior members of the U.S. numerical linear
              algebra community.  As the Householder Symposium is traditionally a gateway
              conference into the field, participation of junior scientists is essential.
              U.S. participation in the Symposium will have a positive impact on the
              continued strong competitiveness of the U.S. in the crucial discipline of
              numerical linear algebra, a field of central importance in scientific
              computing.
