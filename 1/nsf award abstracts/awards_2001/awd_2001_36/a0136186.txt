Abstract    :
              Henry F. Schaefer III of the University of Georgia is supported by the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in
              computational chemistry methodology and applications.  The development,
              testing, and calibration of new methods for the approximate solution of the
              quantum mechanical Schrodinger equation will be carried out.  These and other
              methodological outcomes will be used to explore a variety of important
              prototypical chemical problems. The long-range projects focus on the following
              topics: (1) multireference coupled cluster theory, (2) the SN2 reaction
              paradigm from gas phase to microsolvation and solution phase phenomena, and (3)
              theoretical design of precursors for stoichiometry-controlled chemical vapor
              deposition of optoelectronic materials.  Outcomes are expected to enable new
              understanding of the fundamental manner in which atoms and molecules interact
              and react. 

The first principles description of molecular species begins
              with a theoretical examination of the appropriate electronic energy surface(s).
               Such potential energy surfaces are critical to even qualitatively understand
              how chemical reactions occur.  The exploration of a variety of prototypical
              chemical reaction systems may ultimately make possible the complete computer
              modeling of entire classes of important chemical problems.
