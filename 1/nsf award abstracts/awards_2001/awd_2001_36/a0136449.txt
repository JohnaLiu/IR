This project will consider the
              mechanisms of denitrification - the chemical reduction of dissolved nutrient
              NO3- largely to inert N2 gas- in the polar oceans and specifically the Bering
              Sea. Denitrification in the ocean, the loss of nutrient N essential for
              biological processes, is conventionally thought to take place only in
              conditions of relative dissolved oxygen deficiency ( [O2] < 5-10mM). The
              northern Polar ocean shows significant nitrate depletion relative to phosphate
              despite the concentration of oxygen rarely falling below 15uM throughout much
              of the region. It has been known for many years that the Bering Sea in
              particular  exhibits a sizeable nitrate deficit, but whether this arises in the
              water column or in the sediments, or perhaps is even advected in from
              low-latitude oxygen minimum zones in the Pacific remains unclear. Isotopic
              measurements of nitrate will be used to assess the relative role of sedimentary
              vs. water column denitrification based on observed distinct isotopic signatures
              accompanying these two processes. Using a recently developed isotopic
              analytical method, the d 18O of oceanic nitrate will also be developed as a
              tracer to complement the interpretation of d 15N differences to study these
              aspects of the oceanic nitrogen cycle. A further line of enquiry of the study
              is to consider the proposition that the modern polar Pacific ocean operates as
              an analogue of the glacial Southern Ocean, a key unknown in interpreting
              Holocene variations in atmospheric CO2 and thus broadening our understanding of
              geologically recent climate change.
