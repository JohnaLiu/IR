This award supports a two-year collaborative research
              project between Professor David Goodman at Texas A&M University and Professor
              Yasuhiro Iwasawa of the University of Tokyo in Japan.  The researchers will
              undertake a study of the physical and chemical properties of nanosized metal
              clusters on oxide surfaces.  The collaborators will correlate those physical
              and chemical properties measured for Au and Rh clusters of varying size with
              their catalytic properties.  They will stress the strengths of each group,
              namely, the synthesis capabilities of the Texas group and the unique
              characterization facilities of the Tokyo group, specifically for atomic force
              microscopy.  These studies are essential to understanding the unique properties
              of nanosized metal clusters for catalytic applications, and a key to
              establishing a methodology for predicting new systems and new reactions to be
              addressed by this exciting class of materials.

This research will facilitate
              the collaboration between two strong surface chemical groups with complementary
              expertise and capabilities, allowing an important technical problem to be
              addressed with a broad array of modern surface methods.  The project will offer
              a good opportunity to join efforts between the two countries.  Through the
              exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic
              knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The project
              advances international human resources through the participation of graduate
              students.  The researchers plan to publish results of the research in
              scientific journals and report on the findings at scientific meetings.
