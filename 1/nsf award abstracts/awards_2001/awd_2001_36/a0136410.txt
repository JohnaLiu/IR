Abstract    :
              This project investigates whether the rise in income inequality over the last
              three decades can be explained in part by the growth of corporate
              restructuring.  Internal job ladders within firms may have been weakened by
              changes such as the growth of out-sourcing of employment, privatization of
              public sector work, the de-regulation of service industries, mergers, and a
              shift in the balance of power towards shareholders and away from managers.  
              The research will test the importance of these restructuring changes by
              comparing changes in earnings inequality across 115 cities between 1970 and
              2000 using decennial Census data.  Changes in corporate restructuring (e.g.,
              increases in subcontracting industries) are expected to be correlated with
              increases in wage inequality across the four panels.
