              ABSTRACT

OCE-0136853


The proposal will enable a collaboration between
              Oregon State and geochemists of the Consolidated Research Group in Marine
              Geosciences at the University of Barcelona,  Spain. The purpose of this
              collaboration is to extend some analyses of sediment trap materials collected 
              from sites in the Alboran Sea, during June 1997- May 1998 as part of an EC
              funded Mass Transfer and Ecosystem Response (MATER-II) project. Particulate
              matter barium fluxes and other lithogenic tracer analyses, to be part of a
              dissertation of a student from the University of Barcelona, are to be completed
              with facilities at Oregon State. The scientific goals of the project are a
              better understanding of the causes of variability in the Ba/Corg ratios found
              in different ocean regions.
