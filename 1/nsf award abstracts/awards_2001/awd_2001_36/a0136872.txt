Abstract    :
              Seismologists have predicted that a severe earthquake in the
Istanbul region is
              highly likely in the next 30 years. This
forecast has drawn much attention in
              the media and raises
challenges as to how potential losses may be reduced
              by
protective measures.  Decisions made by private individuals,
by officials,
              and by engineers and builders are all relevant
to this question.  The
              principles underlying protective decision
making need to be better understood,
              for the sake of this and
many other applications.

We investigate how people
              determine whether to purchase insurance
and/or invest in loss-reduction
              measures against risks from fire, theft,
accidents or natural disasters.  We
              examine the effects of different
ways in which risks can be communicated and
              different frames in which
information and choices can be presented; we also
              examine how
protective decisions are affected by instructional modules that
              aid
understanding of probability and that suggest useful general
              strategies
for framing decisions.  To estimate these effects, controlled
              laboratory
experiments, field surveys and interviews will be conducted both
              in
the United States and in Turkey.
