Abstract    :
              Sean Seymore, Department of Chemistry, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program.
              Seymore's research includes the synthesis and characterization of new metal-oxo
              and -nitrido complexes supported by sulfur-rich tripodal ligands. Ligands such
              as phenyltris((methylthio)methyl)borate (PhTt) and
              hydridotris(methimazolyl)borate (Tm) provide a "softer" ligand environment than
              the more common nitrogen or oxygen donor ligands. The change in ligand may
              result in enhanced reactivity or unusual electronic properties in the metal-oxo
              and -nitrido complexes.

Metal-oxo and -nitrido complexes are of interest as
              possible models of important reactive intermediates in catalysis, nitrogen
              fixation, and many other biological processes. Minority Research Planning
              Grants are intended to strengthen the proposal writing and planning
              capabilities of new investigators and to facilitate preliminary studies and
              other planning activities related to the research.
