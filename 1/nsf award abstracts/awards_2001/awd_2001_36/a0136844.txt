Abstract    :
              With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor
              Gutow at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, is studying the modification of
              hydroxylated oxide surfaces.  Using a novel wet-chemical zinc alkyl treatment,
              he and his undergraduate students are exploring the quality and kinetics of
              formation of thin films formed using this approach.  In collaboration with
              Professor Tysoe at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, these films are
              characterized using infrared spectroscopy, quartz crystal microbalance
              measurements, and ultra-high vacuum surface analytical methods.  Strategies for
              the growth of well-characterized monolayer, multilayer, and composite films are
              being developed. In addition, this research program serves as an important
              training ground for undergraduate scientists at this primarily undergraduate
              institution. 

Effective routes to the formation of robust coatings on oxide
              surfaces are needed for technological applications in electronic materials
              chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis.  With support from the Analytical and
              Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Gutow and his collaborators are examining
              novel zinc alkyl methods for forming these coatings.  Synthetic methods, film
              characterization, and undergraduate training in state of the art research
              methods will result from this work.
