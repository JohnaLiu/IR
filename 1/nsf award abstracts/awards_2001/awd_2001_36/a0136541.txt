Combining
              their expertise in calcification, satellite algorithms, sediment trap
              interpretation, water column chemistry, sediment geochemistry and global
              modeling, five principal investigators propose a multidisciplinary approach
              aimed at improving the uncertainties in the rates of CaCO3 cycling in the
              ocean.  To achieve this goal, the PIs plan to address the following four
              objectives on both a regional and a global scale:  (1) improve estimates of the
              standing stock and calcification rates of  surface ocean particulate inorganic
              carbon; (2) improve estimates of surface CaCO3 export; (3) improve estimates of
              shallow (100-1000m) dissolution rates; and (4) improve estimates of deep
              (>1000m)  dissolution rates.  Results from this study will be basin-scale and
              global carbonate budgets to improve our understanding of carbonate production,
              export and shallow/deep water dissolution in the marine environment.
