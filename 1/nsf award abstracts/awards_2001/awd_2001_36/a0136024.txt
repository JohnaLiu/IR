Abstract    :
              Using a five-month planning grant, the International Society for Optical
              Engineering (SPIE) will develop a comprehensive 10-year, educational initiative
              to address the needs of the optical science and engineering communities.  A
              series of workshops will be held at professional meetings of SPIE and the
              Optical Society of America (OSA) to assess regional needs and resources.
              Workshop recommendations will be used to create a plan to enhance the
              scientific and technological literacy of the public and raise the level of
              awareness about career options in this exciting and expanding field.  The
              meetings will incorporate a diverse array of stakeholders including optical
              engineering and science professionals, formal and informal educators, as well
              as representatives from industry and underrepresented groups in science and
              engineering.  Strategic emphasis will be placed on informal science education
              and efforts to recruit and retain minorities and women in optical engineering
              and related sciences.  The resulting education blueprint will be disseminated
              to the field in electronic and print media, and subsequently implemented by
              SPIE and OSA.
