Description: This award is to provide funds to the United
              States Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC to support three joint
              research projects in the area of agricultural biotechnology.  The program
              director is Clemen Gehlhar, of the USDA/Foreign Agriculture Service.  These
              projects include: 1) holding a workshop on developing an insecticidal nematode
              industry in Egypt, managed by Dr. Randy Gaugler of Rutgers University, New
              Brunswick, New Jersey and Dr. Sally Allam of Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt; 2)
              development of improved low-fat soft cheese, managed by Dr. Joseph Frank,
              University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia and Dr. Morsi El-Soda, University of
              Alexandria, Alexandria, Egypt; and 3) examination of poliovirus isolates from
              Egypt by nucleic acid probe hybridization signals to determine the pattern of
              virus spread, managed by Dr. Olen Kew, Center for Diseas Control & Prevention,
              Atlanta, Georgia and Dr. Naglaa A. Hamed, Egyptian Organization for Biological
              Products & Vaccines, Agouza, Cairo, Egypt.

Scope: The award allows USDA to
              support three collaborative projects involving US and Egyptian scientists, in
              areas of interest to the two countries.  This award is made under the US-Egypt
              Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both
              countries to carry out these cooperative activities.
