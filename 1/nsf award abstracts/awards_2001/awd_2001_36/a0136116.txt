A comprehensive set of measurements of scalar gradient spectra
              from the towed microstructure instrument MARLIN, will be collected in regions
              of the abyssal ocean where a large range of both turbulence and stratification
              regimes is expected. The purpose of the study is to investigate the dependence
              of the ratio of salt diffusivity to heat diffusivity on buoyancy Reynolds
              number. To accomplish these objectives, two new sensors using well understood
              principles will be built and deployed on MARLIN. The first is a combined
              thermocouple/microscale conductivity probe. The second is an anisotropy probe
              using multiple thermocouple pairs. A complementary purpose for analyzing
              horizontal scalar fluctuations is to improve the interpretation of
              microstructure measurements.  Many assumptions are commonly made to infer
              mixing and fluxes from one-dimensional, partially resolved scalar spectra, or
              to relate scalar spectra to turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates (such as
              the assumption of isotropy, a universal spectral form for scalar gradients, and
              associated .constants).  Used in conjunction with the present catalog of
              existing vertical spectra and spectra from turbulence simulations, these
              measurements will permit improvements in the ability of the microstructure
              community to reliably quantify the effects of small scale ocean processes.
