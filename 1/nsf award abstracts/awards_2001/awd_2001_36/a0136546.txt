This project will compute the diapycnal fluxes due to surface
              mixed-layer processes in the Southern Ocean.  The resulting fluxes are
              important inputs needed for such applications as the estimation of the
              three-dimensional circulation of the Southern ocean using inverse box models
              and hydrographic data.  The approach that will be used is to force a
              mixed-layer model with surface flux fields with high temporal resolution,
              obtained from meteorological analysis products. This model will be used to
              determine mixed-layer buoyancy, depth and entrainment rates.  These properties,
              when combined with buoyancy gradients determined from hydrographic data, can be
              used to determine the diapycnal flux across the base of the mixed layer
              associated with deepening and small-scale mixing.  The diapycnal flux
              associated with stirring by mesoscale eddies will also be estimated and a net
              diapycnal flux determined.  At present, there is significant uncertainty about
              the size of upper-ocean diapycnal fluxes in the Southern Ocean.  It is
              anticipated that more robust estimates of these fluxes and their variability
              will enable investigators to gain a much clearer picture of the lateral and
              overturning circulation in the Southern Ocean from data collected during the
              World Ocean Circulation Experiment.
