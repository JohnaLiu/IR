              ABSTRACT

OCE-0136597

Recently, it has been suggested that oxygen transport
              into sediments via the roots and rhizomes of seagrasses might resolve the
              observed discrepancy between the amount of carbonate dissolved and the amount
              of acid produced from remineralization of sediment organic matter.  Combining
              field observations, laboratory experiments and modeling analysis, a PI from Old
              Dominion University will team up with a PI from San Jose State University to
              quantify the influence of seagrass productivity on carbon flux and carbonate
              dissolution in shallow waters of Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas, a tropical
              system.  The PIs will compare the sediment and porewater composition recovered
              from a variety of sample types (bare ooid sands to densely vegetates regions
              with >70% seagrass cover) to establish the relationship between carbonate
              dissolution in sediments and seagrass density.  Other studies to be carried out
              include incubation experiments of individual seagrass shoots to determine the
              amount of O2 generated by the roots and rhizomes under variable light and
              porewater O2 conditions.  Additionally, whole sediment core incubation
              experiments will determine the rate of sediment organic matter degradation and
              carbonate dissolution.  Lastly, Drs. Burdige and Zimmerman plan to compare
              their data with those obtained via a model of diagenetic processes in carbonate
              sediments.  Results from this study will not only provide basic information on
              ecological and biogeochemical processes in tropical systems, but will help
              constrain budgets for carbonate cycling in shallow water carbonate bank
              environments.
