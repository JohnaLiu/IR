Data from the RIPEX program will be extensively analyzed
              and archived.  Various hypotheses concerning rip current strength and
              unsteadiness, as well as the instability of the nearshore shear current, will
              be tested using these data and a calibrated version of the Delft3D model. 
              ARGUS systems will be used to monitor two sites within Monterey Bay while
              offshore waves are monitored with wave rider buoys.  Knowing the changes in
              morphology and incoming wave spectra over a two year period, the PIs will test
              the hypothesis that rip spacing is dependent upon the bandwidth of the forcing
              spectrum.  Delft3D will also be used to model the beach evolution.
