This is a collaborative proposal by Principal Investigators
              at the Ohio State University and Old Dominion University.  The Principal
              Investigators will investigate sediment cores from the Chukchi Borderland that
              were collected and curated by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in 1992. The
              core sites are located in an area that contains several generations of
              glacigenic bedforms, which were mapped by the Science Ice Exercise (SCICEX)
              survey in 1999.   A preliminary lithostratigraphy for these cores has been
              developed from their physical properties logs and core descriptions. The
              Principal Investigators will verify and further develop this stratigraphy based
              on lithological and paleontological (foraminiferal) compositions and
              paleomagnetic measurements, reinforced by 14C dating and coccolith studies.
              These approaches will allow them to put the Chukchi Borderland cores into a
              stratigraphic context for the Amerasian Basin and to correlate them with the
              Lomonosov Ridge sediment records. The results should help to establish an
              improved Quaternary age model for the Arctic Ocean. Investigation of glacigenic
              diamictons recovered by cores on the Chukchi Borderland will aid our
              understanding of the processes involved in the grounding of ice shelves on
              submarine rises. By using the composition of glacigenic clasts in sediments as
              provenance tracers they identify glaciation centers that sustained the ice
              shelves. This stratigraphically constrained information will yield insights
              into the Pleistocene glaciation history of both the interior and the periphery
              of the Arctic Ocean and will improve our
understanding of interactions between
              continental-based ice sheets and ice shelves.
