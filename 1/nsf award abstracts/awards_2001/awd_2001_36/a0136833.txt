This pilot
              project will examine the feasibility of creating a database that will allow the
              PI to study both the overall trend of rising imprisonment and rising racial
              disparities in imprisonment, and geographical and temporal differences in these
              trends.  The PI will use official data sets on arrests, imprisonment merged
              with social, economic, and demographic factors to create the new longitudinal
              data set that allow one to control for current and previous reported crimes and
              race-specific arrest rates as well as social factors in predicting imprisonment
              rates.  Cross-sectionally, the most serious crime is found to account for very
              little of the racial disparity in prison admissions; differential arrest rates
              and differential prison/arrest ratios in drug offenses and property crimes
              account for the majority of imprisonment disparity.  The research seeks to
              determine the factors that lead to high enforcement levels against African
              Americans for drug offenses and lower-level offenses.  A range of hypotheses
              will be tested, i.e., this enforcement arises as a reaction to prior elevated
              levels of serious violent crimes, to increasing in-migration or integration of
              minorities and whites, to exogenous macroeconomic or political factors that
              affect crime or policing, or to "shocks" such as drug panics.  Secondly, it
              seeks to identify the consequences of high rates of imprisonment of African
              Americans, testing the hypothesis that, net of controls, black imprisonment
              rates adversely affects black economic well-being and family stability in a
              manner that indirectly contribute to increasing crime rates

Existing
              official data sets will be processed to create this new longitudinal data set
              containing county-level data on race-and offense-specific arrest and
              incarceration rates, along with a wide variety of social, economic and legal
              indicators.  The data set will be constructed for the time period of 1983-1997
              and completed by merging data from the National Corrections Reporting Program
              and the Uniform Crime Reports, along with other data on law enforcement,
              corrections, social, economic and demographic factors from the Census Bureau,
              the Bureau of Justice Statistics and other sources.
