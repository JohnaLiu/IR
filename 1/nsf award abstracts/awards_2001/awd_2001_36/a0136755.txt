Abstract    :
              Summary:  This proposal request support to examine the relationship between
              climate, ocean circulation, and foraminiferal assemblages in Maastrichtian
              sediments recovered from the Blake Nose by documenting changes in foraminiferal
              faunas, geochemistry of foraminifers, magnetic susceptibility and sediment
              color across cyclic intervals.  The data will be used to test the hypothesis
              that the local ecosystem is responding to orbital forcing.
