Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding for a workshop focusing on emerging technologies
              related to a Wireless Mobile Internet.  The workshop is a collaborative effort
              between the Anderson School of Management, Computer Science, and the Electrical
              and Mechanical Engineering Departments of UCLA.  The workshop provides a forum
              for academics, industry, and research establishments to target major aspects
              and problems related to IP-based mobile Internet and wireless access to the
              Internet. Technologies such as, WiFi, Bluetooth, 3G and Java are discussed and
              the possibilities of their integration explored, with applications to mobile
              commerce, wireless transactions, etc.  The workshop takes the form of lectures,
              and panel discussions by leaders in industry and academia. Lectures and
              discussion transcripts will be made available to the public via the WEB.  The
              workshop is held on November 8-9, 2001 on the Campus of UCLA.  The PI
              anticipates that this will become an annual event.
