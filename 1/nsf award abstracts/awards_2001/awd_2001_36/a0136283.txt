Abstract    :
              Physics (13) This project is supporting a Conference on the Introductory
              Calculus-based
Physics Course. The conference is an initiative of the National
              Task Force on
Undergraduate Physics (a cooperative effort of the American
              Association of Physics
Teachers, AAPT, and The American Physical Society, APS,
              and the American Institute of
Physics, AIP). In recent years it has become
              clear that there is a need to update and
revitalize physics education. At the
              same time, a significant base of research in physics
education has emerged
              with a particular emphasis on introductory physics. Therefore the
time is ripe
              to provide departments that are interested in using the results of research
to
              improve their courses a forum where they can get the information they need,
              including
examples of successful implementations. Significant interest exists
              in the community for
such a conference, and the attendance is estimated at
              approximately 200. The result will be
a large number of physics departments
              that will begin to revise their introductory
sequence in line with the best
              thinking on teaching and learning.
