This is a collaborative proposal between the Universities of
              New Hampshire and Maine and the Geological Survey of Canada. This Office of
              International  Science and Engineering is contributing to this award.       The
              Principal Investigators will recover two ice cores the Eclipse Icefield  (3100
              meters) in the St. Elias 
Mountains, Yukon Territory, Canada in cooperation
              with the Geological Survey of Canada in 2002.   The core will be analyzed for
              stable isotopes, major ions, trace  elements, rare earth elements and 
              persistent organic pollutants.   The Eclipse record will provide, for the first
              time, detailed depositional histories of a wide variety of pollutants during
              the last 200 years in the remote northwest North American Arctic.  Through the
              use of unique chemical tracers, the Principal Investigators will be able to
              identify source regions for these pollutants, changes in source regions with
              time, and the role of atmospheric circulation in controlling contaminant
              distributions in the northwest North American Arctic.   The detailed
              multi-parameter record of natural and anthropogenic change will result in a
              greatly improved record of climate and environmental change for a region in
              which very few records currently exist.
