Abstract    :
              0136391  Banerjee  This award provides support to a symposium on Sustainable
              Industrial Development: Energy and Material Exchange and Optimization through
              Eco-Industrial Networks to be hosted by the Center for Economic Development of
              the University of Southern California.  The purpose of the symposium is three
              fold: (1) to bring together experts from the public and private sectors to
              discuss by-product optimization through application of state-of-the-art benign
              manufacturing, advanced environmental technologies and eco-industrial
              processes; (2) to identify cutting-edge environmental technologies and benign
              manufacturing processes that convert wastes into value-added products that will
              facilitate new job creation and business development and (3) to facilitate
              inter-disciplinary dialogue and information sharing leading to the development
              of a research agenda that focuses on increasing industry's competitiveness in
              the global market.
The Center for Economic Development will post papers and
              presentations from the Symposium on its website.  In addition, the National
              Association of Management and Technical Assistance Center (NAMTAC) will assist
              by disseminating findings from the Symposium to a diverse group of member
              organizations, including business, economic development and technical
              assistance providers.
Co-Chairs of this symposium are Dr. Tridib Banerjee,
              Professor at the School of Policy, Planning and Development and Dr, Mansour
              Rahimi, Associate Professor at the School of Engineering, both at USC. ***
