Managing the
              Academic Career for Women Faculty at Undergraduate Computer Science and
              Engineering Institutions.

This award to the Computing Research Association
              (CRA), provides funds to support a workshop entitled "Managing the Academic
              Career for Women Faculty at Undergraduate Computer Science and Engineering
              Institutions".  The workshop will be co-located with the ACM's conference on
              Computer Science Education (SIGCSE 2002) and will be organized by the CRA's
              Committee on the Status of Women in Computer Science and Engineering    
              (CRA-W).  The workshop is planned to provide faculty members in undergraduate
              education information and tools to build successful academic careers.  Further,
              the workshop will provide mentoring activities targeting women in undergraduate
              teaching and research who face particular challenges in pursuing and
              maintaining academic careers at primarily undergraduate teaching
              institutions.
