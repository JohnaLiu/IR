Abstract    :
              This award to Professor Frank Gomez of the California State University, Los
              Angeles, is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the
              Chemistry Division.  A primary objective is to couple on-column reactions with
              affinity-based separations for the dual purposes of high-throughput synthesis
              and rapid analysis.  In addition, capillary electrophoresis will be further
              developed to assess binding constants for substrate-protein and substrate-DNA
              interactions.

New analytical techniques are needed for the study of disease
              and improve public health. The proposed studies will focus on developing these
              new techniques by examining model biological systems with the long-term goal of
              developing useful techniques to study diseases including cancer, Alzheimer's,
              and Parkinsons.  In addition, the proposed research effort will provide
              undergraduate and minority students a solid background in chemistry by
              examining problems at the interface of chemistry and chemistry-related
              disciplines. The research projects planned for the participants are aimed at
              demonstrating the interdisciplinary nature of CE and its importance as a new
              and exciting instrument in solving broad scientific problems.
