Abstract    :
              The goal of Systems Biology is the construction and experimental validation of
              mathematical models that explain and predict the behavior of biological
              systems.  Systems Biology is a synergistic integration of theory, computation
              and experiment.  Intuition is not reliable when confronted with the highly
              interconnected reaction networks that underlie biological processes.  

The
              Second International Conference will be held in November 2001.  It seeks to
              promote the growth and development of the field of Systems Biology.  The goals
              include:  establishing the foundations of the field; presenting new results;
              identifying promising directions; fostering communications; and helping to
              organize the community.  A top priority is to adopt a sound foundation for
              theory, software and experiment. The meeting seeks to be a specific forum for
              Systems Biology.
