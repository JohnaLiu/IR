Abstract    :
              Summary:  This proposal request support to study evolution of wind strength and
              development and migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone in the North
              Pacific Ocean during the late Paleogene and Neogene.  The study will use grain
              size, isotope data and composition of dust in a series of marine cores in the
              tropical and subtropical Pacific to trace wind strength and dust source (Asian
              or American) during the Oligocene to Recent.  The goals of the project are to
              determine the evolution of strength of zonal winds, and to trace the
              development and migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone through time. 
              In addition the study will better constrain the provenance of the American dust
              component and determine the changes in the latitude of the facies change
              between Asian-source and American source dust in the Pacific Basin.
