Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to identify component members of the microbial
              community responsible for the oxidation of CO in coastal marine environments
              through a combination of recent microbiological and molecular approaches, and
              to estimate their contributions to total in situ CO bio-oxidation. The
              researchers will utilize a simple method that does not rely on liquid
              batch?cultures, for screening and isolating microorganisms with a particular
              phenotype. Replicate filters will allow for the isolation and purification of
              active CO-metabolizing colonies. Since this method spatially separates
              otherwise competing populations, simultaneous recovery of organisms with
              different growth rates and nutritional requirements is possible, and large
              numbers of bacteria can be screened rapidly at one time. Cell-specific
              CO-oxidation activity will be determined for selected strains with time-series
              14 CO-oxidation methods. Molecular phylogeny based on 16S-rRNA sequence
              information within the context of the large and growing 16S database will
              determine the phylogenetic relatedness and identity of marine CO?oxidizing
              bacteria that result from our cultivation program. A collective CO-oxidation
              rate calculated from physiological measurements and abundance estimates of
              CO-oxidizing organisms will be balanced with biogeochemical CO-oxidation
              measurements to verify that activity and abundance of CO-oxidizing bacteria can
              account for the total CO-oxidation that is observed in natural waters.
