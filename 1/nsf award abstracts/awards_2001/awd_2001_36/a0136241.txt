Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to analyze the impact of the stock market on the
              innovative capabilities of high- technology companies that have been central to
              the "new economy". The empirical focus will be on equipment suppliers in the
              optical networking industry --an industry that integrates the bandwidth
              potential of fiber optics with the data communications potential of the
              Internet. Through in-depth comparative analysis of the development and
              utilization of technology at Cisco Systems, Nortel Networks, Lucent
              Technologies, Alcatel, and Sycamore Networks, this project seeks to determine
              the impacts of both the changing role of the stock market and the volatility in
              stock prices on the accumulation of innovative capabilities in an industry that
              is central to the prosperity of the US and global economies.
