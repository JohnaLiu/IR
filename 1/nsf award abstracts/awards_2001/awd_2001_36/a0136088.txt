A field investigation will be carried out to study the
              role that bubbles and their associated buoyancy play in the energy balance of
              the surf zone.  Existing measurements do not agree with present models of
              turbulent dissipation in this region.  It is hypothesized that the a
              significant buoyancy flux associated with bubbles may have an important effect
              on mean density and, consequently, dissipation.  The vertical structure of
              dissipation, void fraction, and buoyancy flux due to air entrainment will be
              estimated.  New theory for energy budgets and surf zone turbulence will be
              defined and tested.
