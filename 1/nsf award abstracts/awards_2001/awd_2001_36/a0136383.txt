Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

The nervous system is mainly composed of two types of cells, neurons
              and glia. Unlike glia, most neuronal cells lose their ability to divide
              (proliferate) at an early developmental stage. Therefore neuronal loss is an
              irreversible process and a major contributor to the impairment of function in
              the central nervous system (CNS), underscoring the importance of identifying
              molecules that can decrease neuronal loss. Receptor protein tyrosine kinases
              (RPTks) are a class of molecules that plays a pivotal role in the survival and
              proliferation of a large variety of cells.  The molecule Gas6 (growth arrest
              specific gene6), the focus of this study, can bind and activate three related
              RPTKs, Tyro-3, Axl and Mer.  Because Gas6 and Tyro-3 are abundantly expressed
              in the CNS it is possible that Gas6 acting through Tyro-3 can promote neuronal
              survival and induce cell proliferation; this is the hypothesis that will be
              tested.  For these studies a combination of morphological and biochemical
              assays will be used to monitor the survival and proliferative effects of Gas6
              on neuroblastoma cells and of neurons obtained from mice in which the Tyro-3
              receptor has been genetically inactivated. These studies should help to
              identify new molecules involved in the promotion of cell survival and
              proliferation in the CNS, knowledge that may ultimately be used to reduce
              neuronal loss.
