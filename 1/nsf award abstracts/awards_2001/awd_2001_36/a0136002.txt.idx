Abstract    :
              Basic discoveries and innovations in manufacturing methods and processes will be
              needed to achieve the full impact of nano-technology.  The multidisciplinary
              experts from the United States and the European Community gathered for this
              workshop will advise NSF on research needs for the future and develop a joint
              agenda for US/EC cooperation in nano-manufacturing.  This 2002 NSF-EC
              Nanomufacturing and Processing Workshop will be held January 5-7, 2002 in San
              Juan, Puerto Rico.  The workshop will be held immediately before the 2002 NSF
              Design, Service, and Manufacturing Grantees and Research Conference, so in
              addition to reporting the workshop results by publications, the findings will
              be immediately reported to the research community at the conference.
