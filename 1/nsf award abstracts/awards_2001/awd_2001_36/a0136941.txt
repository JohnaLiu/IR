Abstract    :
              Summary:  This project will complete an effort to calibrate isotope and trace
              element chemistry in the skeletons of sclerosponges as proxies for temperature
              and salinity.  The study will measure Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca as well as O and C
              isotopes in sclerosponge skeletons from Discovery Bay, Jamaica  previously
              stained in the field and for which continuous water temperature and composition
              data are available.  In addition sclerosponge skeletons from different water
              depths at Lee Stocking Island will be analyzed to reconstruct the thermocline
              structure.
