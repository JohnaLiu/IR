This project will collect RAFOS
              float data, hydrographic data and altimetry to pursue a greater understanding
              of the pathways of waters exiting the subpolar regions. Sequentially released,
              acoustically-tracked, RAFOS floats will be deployed at the Labrador Sea Water
              level in the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) along the western boundary of
              the Labrador Sea. The floats will be released on a seasonal basis for three
              years and they will be tracked as they transit through the junction in pathways
              near Flemish Cap.  These observations will also be used to address an apparent
              contradiction between existing theory of the export of newly ventilated waters
              from the sub-polar regions via the DWBC and recent drifter tracks that show the
              profiling floats turning eastward along the subpolar-subtropical gyre boundary.
               The new data will also be used to address hypothesis related to the structure
              of the narrow DWBC path, the temporal variability and intermittency in Labrador
              Sea Water pathways, the extent to which the deep ocean is ventilated, and the
              time scale of that ventilation.
