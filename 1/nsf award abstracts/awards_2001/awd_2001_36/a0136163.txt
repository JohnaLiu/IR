This is a workshop proposal submitted by Dr. Ratana
              Chuenpagdee, College of William and Mary, and Dr. Kungwan Juntarashote,
              Kasetsart University, Thailand, to organize a workshop on "the roles of
              education in sustaining integrated coastal management efforts" for May 12-16,
              2002 in Bangkok, Thailand.   This is an important workshop to address the
              challenges of coastal zone management.  This workshop will bring together
              educators, students, researchers, and coastal managers from the USA and the
              Asia-Pacific region to exchange examples of successful education programs on
              integrated coastal zone management and to develop an education toolbox that
              will be used to share information, resources and experience in sustaining
              integrated coastal management processes.  The meeting will include 15 U.S.
              participants (5 students and 10 experts and educators) and 15 Asian
              participants (4 students and 11 experts and educators).  This proposal meets an
              important NSF goal of human resource development, and addresses an important
              issue for sustaining the global coastal ocean environment.
