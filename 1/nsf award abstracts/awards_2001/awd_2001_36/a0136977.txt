Recent investigations of the
              biogeochemistry of iron in the ocean has spurred interest in the interaction of
              atmospherically sourced bioactive elements including iron, zinc, cobalt and
              copper on the speciation, organic complexation and bioavailability of these
              trace metals in surface seawater. In conjunction with  a planned field
              expedition to the central western Pacific (NSF OCE-0117917- Measures, Landing
              and Cutter) this collaborative research effort will employ a range of
              electrochemical and mass spectrometric based analytical techniques uniquely
              sensitive to the sub-nanomolar concentrations of the elements Fe, Co, Zn and Cu
              found in surface seawater. The use of competitive ligand equilibration
              experiments along with the sensitive voltammetric stripping analyses used in
              the electrochemical studies will provide relative indication of the binding
              strength of organic ligands either produced during surface phytoplankton blooms
              or found in atmospheric precipitation or dry deposition
