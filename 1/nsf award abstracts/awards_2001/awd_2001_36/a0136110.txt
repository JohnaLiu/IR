Abstract    :
              The proposal is for an experimental and theoretical research program to
              investigate turbulent flow and convective heat transfer in pin fin arrays,
              which are an important component of modern gas turbine blade cooling systems. 
              From the database generated from comprehensive experiments, the development of
              more physically based turbulence closure models will be undertaken, and these
              will be applied to commercial software packages.  The results, if successful,
              will allow improved cooling system design with more rapid design cycles,
              leading to reduced cost and higher engine efficiencies due increased allowable
              turbine inlet temperatures.
