Abstract    :
              0136836/Han

The goals of this project are: to determine the variability of
              the tropical Indian Ocean forced by intraseasonal atmospheric forcing; to
              understand the dynamics and thermodynamics of such variability; and to examine
              the impact of atmospheric intraseasonal forcing on oceanic seasonal variability
              and the Indian Ocean Zonal Mode.  
The primary motivation is the presence of
              large intraseasonal fluctuations in currents, mixed layer depth and upper ocean
              temperature in the Indian Ocean.  It is hoped that a better understanding of
              the processes involved will be useful for unraveling some of the questions
              about how regional climate is determined.

Numerical simulations will be made
              with the ocean component of the National Center for Atmospheric Rresearch's
              climate system model.  From a diagnostic study of the comparison of the
              response of the Indian Ocean to quasi-realistic forcing with and without
              intraseasonal variability, the nature of the response, and the processes
              responsible for it, will be determined.  Numerical solutions will also be
              compared to data from the JASMINE and WOCE field experiments.
