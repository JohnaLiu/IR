Abstract    :
              In the late 1980's the field of computational science and engineering emerged as
              a new discipline, one with a research core that generalized from its many
              applications and led to the creation os several academic programs at leading
              unversities.  Computational science has since proven itself with many
              successes, but it has also evolved both in its tools, methodologies, and
              research challenges and goals.  This workshop seeks to re-examine the area, and
              develop a new consensus on the directions it should be taking.  A major goal of
              the workshop will be a document summarizing the accomplishments of the past
              decade, and prognosticating the future for scientific computing research.
