Abstract    :
              This award will provide for the acquisition of a multi-processor Linex cluster
              wtih seismic processing software and allow the upgrade of existing
              workstations.  The group using the system has an increase in computational
              needs due to several large data sets recently collected, in addition to new
              faculty members.
