Abstract    :
              Over the last few years, most aspects of the mathematics curriculum have been
              undergoing major changes. The calculus reform movement has generated changes
              both in terms of what is taught and how materials are taught; these changes are
              well documented. In the eighties a conference on reform calculus was held at
              Tulane University in New Orleans. The Tulane conference helped shape some of
              the ideas of reform calculus. This project does the same for precalculus.
              

The purpose of the workshop is to rethink the preparation for calculus,
              given that students are having such different mathematical experiences in high
              school, calculus in college has changed, technology is providing mathematical
              tools for both teaching and learning, and college algebra is in the process of
              changing. Several mathematics educators were invited to a working workshop that
              was designed to address each of these issues.
