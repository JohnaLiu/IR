Abstract    :
              CAMDA (Critical Assessment of Microarray Data Analysis Techniques) was founded
              to initiate a community-wide critical assessment of different techniques used
              in analysis of microarrays.  It provides a forum for a cross-section of
              research looking at a common data set and applying innovative analytical
              techniques.  The conference aims to establish the state-of-the-art in
              microarray data mining, as well as identify progress and highlight the
              direction for future effort.  CAMDA is a functional genomics successor of other
              experiments such as GASP in genome annotation and CASP in protein structure
              prediction.  Over 250 scientists attended the first meeting.

Two data sets
              will be made available for analysis.  The conference also includes oral and
              poster presentations. Abstracts will be published electronically and links will
              be made for the analytical tools.  Attendance of students is particularly
              supported.
