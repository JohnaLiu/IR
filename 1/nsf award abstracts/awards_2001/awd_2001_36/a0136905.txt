Abstract    :
              The proponents will further test and develop a flow through analytical technique
              for the determination of Mg/Ca in planktonic forams, a proxy for sea surface
              temperature (SST). A problem with measured Mg/Ca in bulk dissolved samples of
              forams, is that dissolution can fractionate Mg/Ca. In addition, later
              calcification and contaminant phases can complicate the Mg/Ca signal. The flow
              through cleaning technique, using the ICPMS and time-resolved analysis (TRA),
              will allow monitoring of the Mg/Ca signal as the forams are slowly dissolved
              and analyzed. This technique is similar in principle to stepwise heating used
              for 40Ar/39Ar dating and is expected to distinguish between the early calcite
              formed nearest the surface and other unwanted signals. A pilot study of samples
              from two cores taken at ~900m and ~2000 at the Cocos Ridge show promising early
              results. TRA analysis of prepared samples of G. ruber, and G. sacculifer show
              high initial values of Mg/Ca thought to be the initially formed calcite. More
              calibration of the technique will be done for other samples, with comparisons
              to Mn contents and d18O. Finally, the new technique will be used to analyze SST
              in map and time-series back to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in cores from the
              tropical and subtropical Pacific to resolve controversy about the role of the
              tropics in climate change.
