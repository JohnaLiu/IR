Abstract    :
              Traditionally, Comparative Advantage had been the foundational logic that best
              frames the understanding of trade. A second alternative, that focuses on the
              Advantages of Specialization, offers an argument for the opening of markets
              that commands relatively more public support. Neoclassical economics was
              derived on the basis of comparative advantage because it allowed for constant
              returns postulate, without which a competitive economy seemed impossible.  Only
              in the 1980's and 1990's, attention was directed to Adam Smith's emphasis on
              specialization and the size of the market.  Modern analyses, not only
              demonstrates compatibility with competitive organization, but also identify
              sources of endogenous growth. These modern developments have been
              systematically presented in Xiaokai Yang's treatise, Economics: New Classical
              versus Neoclassical Framework (Blackwell, 2001). 

The purpose of the
              workshop is to stimulate examination of this emerging research program, which
              young scientists will not have encountered in their textbooks or in orthodox
              training.  The workshop will expose them to Professor Yang, and to a critical
              evaluation of his treatise, in the expectation that they will, themselves,
              shift some of their interests to "generalized increasing returns" and its
              implications.
