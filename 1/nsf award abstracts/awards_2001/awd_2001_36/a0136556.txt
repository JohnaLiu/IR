Abstract    :
              This proposal plans to extend the theory of how people make economic decisions
              in two ways. The first project focuses on the preference for variety, which is
              usually ignored. We plan to study this preference by investigating the way in
              which preferences depend on the underlying characteristic of the goods. We will
              devise a choice structure from which characteristics are derived as subjective
              elements in the representation of individual choices. This will allow empirical
              testing and estimation of the theory. We also plan to identify the class of
              preferences over goods that can be generated by preferences over
              characteristics that satisfy conditions like concavity. Such class is larger
              than the set of neoclassical utilities, but still a restricted set.

The
              second project further develops the theory of preference for flexibility and
              commitment, and will model unforeseen actions.  In this way, we will try to
              explain things such as multiple temptations, compromise and guilt. The fact
              that some actions are unforeseen is a natural extension of the dual idea that
              events are unforeseen. This second project will provide a complete analysis of
              a crucial and so far relatively unexplored source of uncertainty.
