Abstract    :
              The Carnegie-Rochester Conference on Public Policy is designed to foster
              research and discussion of major policy issues by economists from academia and
              various policy making organizations.  Economists in universities are often
              unfamiliar with the constraining effect of institutional arrangements in the
              shaping of policy issues whereas economists in government are often less aware
              of current research developments and their implications.  The principal
              objectives of the conference series are (i) to stimulate policy relevance in
              theoretical and empirical research in economic science, (ii) to encourage
              interchange of scientific ideas among analysts with different approaches, and
              (iii) to generate greater understanding by academic economists of
              practitioners' environments.  The conferences are held semi-annually at
              Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Rochester.  About 50
              participants plus faculty and graduate students from the host institution are
              invited to each conference.  Participants from U.S. and foreign central banks
              and U.S. and international agencies attend regularly, and special care is taken
              to involve promising young scholars.  The papers and formal discussions are
              edited and published so as to broaden the impact of the conference.
