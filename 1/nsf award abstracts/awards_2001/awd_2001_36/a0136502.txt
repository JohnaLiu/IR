Abstract    :
              Abstract:

The Conquest hybrid disk/memory file system takes a new approach
              to
filesystem design by storing most information in RAM, devoting disk
only
              to large files.  Preliminary results have shown great benefits
from the
              Conquest approach, despite the fact that the on-disk portion
of the file
              system has yet not been optimized.  In this research, we
will investigate the
              optimal method of storing those large disk-based
files.  After reviewing prior
              research in disk layout, we will design
and implement a layout that is
              optimized for storing large files in an
environment that is free of metadata
              and small files.  We will also
develop a "cleaner" that will dynamically
              adjust the arrangement of
on-disk data to optimize the performance of disk
              access.  Finally, we
will take measurements to quantify the improvements
              brought by the new
approach.
