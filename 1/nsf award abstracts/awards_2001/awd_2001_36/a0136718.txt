Abstract    :
              The investigators will determine the energy distribution of test particles
              accelerated in various magnetic field reconnection geometries. This will be
              achieved by integrating the particle equations of motion in specified analytic
              and numerical solutions of the magnetohydrodynamic equations. From these
              detailed computations, scaling laws for solar energetic particle (SEP) events
              will be derived, and subsequently compared with observations from the High
              Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (HESSI) satellite. The major goal of this
              effort is to develop a testable model capable of explaining how and why
              different reconnection configurations produce different acceleration regimes,
              ranging from prompt electron acceleration to gamma-ray energies to proton
              acceleration to GeV energies in large gradual flares. This work promises to
              provide critical new insight on to SEP events, which are a prominent component
              of Space Weather.
