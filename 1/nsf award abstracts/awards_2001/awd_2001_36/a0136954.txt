              ABSTRACT

OCE-0136954


As more is discovered of the extent and nature of
              the large scale venting and circulation of hydrothermal waters through the
              oceanic crust, delineation of abiotic chemistries from subsurface
              biogeochemical cycles has become increasingly blurred in some senses, yet
              clearly intertwined in others. Consideration of the chemistry of organic
              compounds in aqueous hydrothermal fluids currently poses many uncertainties and
              intriguing questions. The deliberately constrained laboratory experimental
              approach of this study will use flexible-cell hydrothermal vessels to
              investigate a number of key chemical objectives:  i) measurement of calcite
              solubility at temperatures and pressures appropriate to the conditions
              experienced during the hydrothermal alteration of oceanic basalts, ii)
              determination the mineral catalyzed rates of abiotic reduction of CO2 to CH4
              and iii) evaluation of the influence of the thermodynamic activity of water on
              the effectiveness of catalytically active minerals on the abiotic formation of
              reduced carbon compounds.
Interpretation of the results of these
              investigations has impact upon topics as seemingly diverse as  the mid-ocean
              ridge carbon cycle, the geological sequestration of excess carbon dioxide, the
              existence of life in extreme environments and even its origin.
