Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding for equipment upgrades for the Econometrics
              Laboratory (EML) at the University of California, Berkeley, including a 660GB
              fiber channel disk tray for its fileserver, and a five-unit tape library for
              backups.  The disk tray will increase the storage capacity of the EML, and
              provides larger, faster disks for improved I/O as well as RAID performance and
              fail-safe capability.  The new removable media technology will remain
              synchronized with the new disk technology.
      The EML provides a
              state-of-the-art computational environment for economic research, particularly
              in compute-intensive methods and the analysis of very large datasets. 
              Extending its disk storage and backup capabilities provides key resources that
              are urgently needed by applied econometrics faculty investigators and graduate
              dissertation students.
