A steering committee formed under the auspices of the Board on
              Agriculture and Natural Resources and the Board on Life Sciences will help to
              plan and host a workshop focusing on domestic animal genomics and its
              integration with other genomics and functional genomics projects.  The diverse
              group of experts who participated in the sequencing of the human, mouse, C.
              elegans, Drosophila, Arabidopsis, rice, E. coli, and  other genomes will be
              brought together with others involved in genomics mapping and sequencing for
              important livestock and companion animals and their pathogens.  These experts,
              along with appropriate policy makers and stakeholders, will participate in a
              one-day meeting designed to 1) provide a forum for exchange among the diverse
              communities of genomics and functional genomics experts, 2) elicit discussions
              of research directions in animal genomics that would benefit agriculture and
              society while leading to greater biological understanding, and 3) identify
              opportunities and obstacles that might be encountered in developing a
              coordinated, multi-organism functional and comparative genomics effort that
              would include domestic animals.
