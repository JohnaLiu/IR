Abstract    :
              This symposium, to be held at the Materials Research Society Meeting November
              26-30, focuses on polymer interfaces and thin films.

Polymer interfaces
              are critical for many technological and industrial applications in thin films
              such as found in electronic packaging, lithographic applications, sensor
              technology, or in bulk systems such as adhesives or polymer blends.  The
              structure and architecture of interfaces in thin films and bulk polymeric
              systems involving applications can be exceedingly complex.  In thin films, the
              technological drive to diminish film thickness while simultaneously enhancing
              homogeneity, stability and adhesion is a challenging task driving research in
              newer areas of nanofilled and controlled nanostructured and nanopatterned
              films.  Tailoring of surface and interfacial properties are equally important
              for new developments in traditional fields of bulk polymer blends, reactive and
              compatibilized systems, etc.  Since empirical approaches to R&D can be
              time-consuming and costly, the need also exists for concurrent development of
              theory and modeling, and simulations of polymer interfaces with predictive
              capability of ultimate structure-property relationship.  Novel methodologies
              and measurement techniques also play an important role in the future
              development of the field, especially with the advent of combinatorial methods
              to thin film coatings for material science.  A joint symposium with
              "Combinatorial Approach to Polymers" is planned.
