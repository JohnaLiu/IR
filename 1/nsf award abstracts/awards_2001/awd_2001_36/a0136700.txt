This project introduces a novel approach to representing
              boundary conditions in ocean models.  The idea is, absent the ability to follow
              small-scale physical processes in detail, to represent the influence of these
              small-scale processes on the larger-scale dynamics resolved by the model by a
              stochastic process.  The project will try several different auto-regressive
              representations of the boundary conditions and examine how the large-scale
              structure of the flow reacts to these.  The model results will be compared with
              data from observations near the Florida Current made with HF radar.  Using
              inverse techniques, based on a Markov random field approach, the values of
              parameters in the stochastic models of boundary conditions will be estimated. 
              The sensitivity of these inversions will also be determined.  In larger
              domains, dynamically similar to the North Atlantic, the question of whether
              stochastic boundary conditions along the eastern boundary can lead to internal
              jets (beta plumes) will be studied.  Initially, the numerical circulation model
              will be a reduced-gravity, quasigeostrophic model in idealized geometries.  The
              most effective approaches to stochastic boundary conditions will then be
              transferred to a primitive-equation OGCM.
