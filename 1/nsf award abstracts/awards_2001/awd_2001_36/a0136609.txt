              ABSTRACT

OCE-0136609

Box models of the ocean-atmosphere carbon system have
              suggested that atmospheric CO2 is sensitive to perturbation of the high
              latitude surface ocean properties and quite insensitive to low latitude
              perturbations.  In contrast, ocean general circulation and carbon cycle models
              show a greater role for the ocean's warm surface waters and a weaker response
              to changes in high latitude biological export efficiency.  For this reason, a
              PI from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, proposes to test the hypothesis
              that these discrepancies can be attributed to the role of the ventilated
              thermocline and mode waters using a hierarchy of numerical ocean circulation
              and biogeochemistry models.  In addition, the PI plans to carry out detailed
              simulations of the interannual variability of the thermocline, mode waters and
              the Southern Ocean intermediate waters and their ventilation to examine the
              interannual and decadal variability of air-sea gas fluxes and atmospheric CO2.
