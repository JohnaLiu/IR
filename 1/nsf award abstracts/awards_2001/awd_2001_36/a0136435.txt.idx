Abstract    :
              EIA-0136435 Nicholas Diakides IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology
              Society  Title: IEEE EMBS Infrared Imaging Workshop  Infrared imaging is an
              emerging technology and has the potential of leading to multi-modality sensor
              systems for enhancing the screening, diagnostic, and therapeutic capabilities
              of future medical practice.  It can also be used alone for applications such as
              those of a pathophysiological nature (functional and soft tissue imaging); a
              unique advantage since it is provided by a totally non-invasive, non-ionizing,
              and low-cost procedure. The concept of thermal imaging in medicine toady is
              being evolved with the use of the advanced infrared imaging technology.  It is
              now being merged with "smart algorithms" and image processing for the effective
              interpretation of medical images and the building of new bridges between
              computer science, engineering, and medicine.  To this end, an IEEE EMBS
              Infrared Imaging Workshop is being held. Experts in infrared sensors
              technology, infrared image analysis and image interpretation are giving
              presentation and discussing various uses of infrared imaging in medicine in a
              hope to further the state-of-the-art.
