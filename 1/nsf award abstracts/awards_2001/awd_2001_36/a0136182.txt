Abstract    :
              Information personalization refers to the automatic adjustment of information
              content, structure, and presentation tailored to an individual user. The goal
              of this research project is to develop a modeling methodology for information
              personalization. The methodology developed in this project termed PIPE
              ("Personalization is Partial Evaluation") makes no commitments to a particular
              personalization algorithm or format for information resources. Instead it
              emphasizes the representation of information systems in a way that allows their
              subsequent personalization. With this methodology, web sites and other
              information resources can be modeled and personalized for users'
              information-seeking goals. The specific activities conducted in this project
              include (1) characterizing the types of information systems for which this
              methodology is applicable and (2) constructing "personable" information system
              designs. The first activity is approached by defining how information systems
              are constructed and the representations they afford. The second activity
              involves the definition of a "personability" metric for evaluating information
              system designs. Human-computer interaction methodologies and systematic
              procedures for evaluation need to be enhanced to provide the needed input for
              the model formulation and validation. The results of this project will help
              define "personable information spaces" rigorously. With a formal model for
              personalization, we can design better information systems that can help users
              achieve their information-seeking goals.
