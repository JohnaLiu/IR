Abstract    :

This project involves the analysis and synthesis of
              several types of data from the recently completed North Brazil Current (NBC)
              Ring Experiment.  Preliminary results from this experiment suggest that these
              large ocean eddies may carry a significant amount of upper ocean meridional
              mass transport in the tropical Atlantic Ocean.  Data available for this
              synthesis include RAFOS float and surface drifter trajectories, hydrography
              from multiple cruises, data from current meter moorings and inverted echo
              sounders.  It is expected that most attention will be given to the float and
              drifter data, together with the hydrography.   The analysis has several aims
              including: describing the physical structure of NBC rings after separation;
              determining rates of translation, mixing and decay as rings move north-west;
              determining the processes responsible for deformation and destruction of NBC
              rings as they encounter the Antilles; and to identify the fate of the S.
              Atlantic water in ring cores.
