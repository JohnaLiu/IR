Abstract    :
              Summary:  This proposal request support to complete a multiproxy paleoclimate
              record from Cariaco Basin ODP Site 1002 to the base of the sediment section at
              about 550,000 years.  The study will include stable isotope and foraminiferal
              census data at sample resolution of about 300 years for the entire record. 
              Critical intervals will be sampled at finer resolution to evaluate
              subcentury-scale features.  The study will be coordinated with measurements of
              a number of other proxies by informal collaborators as well as a modeling
              effort.  The overall objective is to provide an integrated data set suitable
              for testing the hypothesis that changes in tropical hydrology are a potential
              driver of global climate change on millennial to Milankovich time-scales.
