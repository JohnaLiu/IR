Abstract    :
              Summary:  This proposal request support  for a comprehensive chemical and
              isotopic survey (major, trace, and rare earth elements along with Sr, Nd and Pb
              isotopes)  to test the hypothesis that the source of particulate Fe to central
              equatorial Pacific surface waters is the Papua New Guinea region via the
              eastward flowing Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC).  In addition the study will
              assess whether wind blown material is more important as a source of particulate
              Fe at 4oN and 5-2oS than is PNG-derived Fe.  The study will examine downcore
              variations in the EUC-sourced Fe through glacial-interglacial cycles, and
              examine whether changes can be correlated with changes of export production
              recorded in the sediments.
