Abstract    :
              Summary:  This project will determine subsurface reservoir ages of waters around
              New Zealand by dating planktonic and benthic foraminifers associated with
              tephras in marine cores.  The study will focus on dating samples associated
              with the Kawakawa tephra (ca 22,590 14C yr).  The Kawakawa ash is easily
              identified and is widely distributed which will allow dating of intermediate
              and deep waters along the tephra isochron.  Trace element measurements on
              foraminifer shells and stable carbon isotope measurements will also be done as
              a cross check on circulation changes derived from the 14C age distribution.
