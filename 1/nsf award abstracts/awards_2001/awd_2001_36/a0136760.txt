Funds are provided for the development of two simplified
              models to be used in an investigation of the adjustment of an estuary to
              changes in river flow, wind forcing, and tidal forcing.  The simplest model
              depends on two bulk parameters representing vertical and longitudinal
              stratification while the other is laterally and layer averaged.  Further
              three-dimensional modeling will be performed with ECOM-si, a modified version
              of the Princeton Ocean Model, in simple topographic scenarios. The
              three-dimensional model will be verified using data from Willipa Bay and Budd
              Inlet.  The output from the three-dimensional model will be compared to
              solutions from the more simplified models and used to verify the latter. 
              Laboratory modeling will also be undertaken.  The results of this research will
              be quickly transferred to students in the PI's courses.  The PI has close
              collaborations with state environmental managers intends rapid technology
              transfer to practical applications, as well.
