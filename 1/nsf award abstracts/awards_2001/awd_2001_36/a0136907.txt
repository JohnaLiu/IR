ABSTRACT

OCE-0136814 / OCE-0136907


In this project researchers at the
              Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the University of Washington will
              attempt to develop a method to evaluate anthropogenic changes in the carbon
              isotopic composition (d 13C) of  dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)in the oceans,
              the so-called 13C Suess effect.  Development of this  method should permit
              reconstruction of the d 13C-DIC and DIC Suess effect globally using  both the
              new WOCE/JGOFS/OACES d 13C-DIC and DIC datasets.  These  reconstructions will
              provide, for the first time, global coverage of  (1) the relationship  between
              the anthropogenic 13CO2 and 12 CO2 changes, ( 2) the total d 13C of DIC change
              in  the oceans, and (3) the pre-industrial d 13C of DIC distribution.  The
              reconstructions should also be of immediate benefit to modelers of the
              modern-day global carbon cycle and to the  paleoceanographic community.
