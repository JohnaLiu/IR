Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks support for carrying out two conferences to scope out and
              define the scientific and out reach programs that will be done in the
              anticipated National underground Science Laboratory at Lead, South Dakota. 
              Educators, geologists, biologists, and physicists will attend both of these
              conferences.  

The workshop will produce a white paper defining the nature
              and the timing of the science and outreach activities for the underground
              laboratory.  The white paper will also serve as a guide to aid the baseline
              design of the laboratory.
