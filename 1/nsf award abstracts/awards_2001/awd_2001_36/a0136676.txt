Abstract    :
              This dissertation research will examine the local understanding of human rights
              within the context of the recently concluded Disappearances Commission in Sri
              Lanka. The Co-principal investigator will provide an ethnographic analysis of
              the concept of human rights as understood, interpreted, used, and practiced at
              the grass roots level. Moreover, this research examines the local and national
              level discourses on human rights in Sri Lanka to provide an understanding of
              the Commission as a site of convergence of these different perspectives.
              Through in-depth interviews, observations, and recording of narratives of those
              who were involved in the Disappearances Commission in southern Sri Lanka, this
              research will study the conceptualization of human rights within the local
              context. The national discourse on human rights vis-a-vis the Commission will
              be analyzed through a careful investigation of archival sources. This will be
              juxtaposed against the local discourse to provide a scientific understanding of
              the Commission. This research contributes towards an understanding of
              contemporary Sri Lanka and provides an ethnographic understanding of human
              rights and "commissions" which have become an integral part of transnational
              legal processes.
