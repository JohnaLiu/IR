Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the University of Central Florida, under the
              direction of Dr. Sudipta Seal, for the support of an international research
              collaboration entitled, "U.S.-Australia Cooperative Research Development of
              Solgel Derived Monsized Oxide Nanoparticles." This three year collaboration
              between student and faculty researchers at the Advanced Materials Processing
              Analysis Center/Mechanical, Materials and Aerospace Engineering at UCF and
              Materials Science and Engineering research groups at the University of New
              South Wales, Sydney, Australia will help establish a joint international
              research program in nanotechnolgy research which is proving to be one of the
              most promising frontiers in scientific research and development.
