Field and simulation studies will be used to determine
              where upwelled water originates, i.e. solely from the bottom boundary layer
              (BBL) or from a thicker region of the lower layer fluid, and where the
              displaced surface water goes, e.g. offshore in the the surface layer or,
              through subduction, to intermediate layers.  Five dye studies, using
              fluorescene and rhodamine-WT, are proposed for the upwelling region over the
              Oregon shelf.  Releases will occur in three different locations - beneath and
              inshore of the upwelling jet, in the BBL beneath the jet where onshore movement
              is expected, and inshore of the jet, just beneath the mixed layer but still in
              the Ekman layer, where offshore movement and possible subduction is expected. 
              Dye will be tracked for 72 hours.  The background environment will be defined
              by GLOBEC cruises, at least during the first field year.  Three releases from
              the R/V Elakha will be traced during the first year.  The second year will
              involve two larger releases from the R/V Wecoma.  A version of the Princeton
              Ocean Model, configured for the region, will be run for comparison.  Particle
              tracing techniques will be used to model the initial, small-scale dispersion. 
              Both idealized situations and realistic modeling will be attempted.  A 2-D
              ocean-going model will be used, in conjunction with buoyed GPS drifters, to
              track the subsurface dye patch after release.  The results of the study will be
              a set of Lagrangian observations of cross-shelf transport pathways during
              upwelling.  These will lead to improved understanding of circulation and
              mixing.
