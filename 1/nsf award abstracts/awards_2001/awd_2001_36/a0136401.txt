Abstract    :
              This research project, in the laboratory of Professor Janice Reutt-Robey at the
              University of Maryland-College Park, investigates the structure and reactivity
              of molecular scale architectures formed on well characterized metal surfaces. 
              With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, the detailed
              structure and motion of alane oligomers formed on the Al(111) surface are being
              examined using scanning tunneling microscopy.  A similar approach is used to
              examine the structure and reactivity of ordered architectures formed by the
              adsorption of N-heteroaromatic carboxylic acids on the silver surface. 
              Information obtained from these studies is fundamental to our understanding of
              the growth and operation of nano-scale electronic devices.

Using scanning
              tunneling microscopy and other surface sensitive tools, Professor Reutt-Robey
              and her coworkers at the University of Maryland are probing the adsorption and
              reaction of a range of interesting chemical systems with connections to the
              formation of nano-scale devices.  The interaction of atomic hydrogen with
              aluminum surfaces to form ordered oligomers on the surface is being examined. 
              Also, the adsorption and interaction of strongly hydrogen bonding nitrogen
              containing aromatic acids is being examined.  The information gained from these
              studies will provide important underpinning for the synthesis and manipulation
              of nano-scale architectures on surfaces.
