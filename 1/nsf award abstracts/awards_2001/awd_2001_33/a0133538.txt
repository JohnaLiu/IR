Abstract    :
              Neuropeptides are compounds that are essential for regulating a wide array of
              cellular physiological functions.  Many have been isolated from insect species,
              and the fruitfly, Drosophila, offers an exceptional model system in which to
              study the functions of neuropeptides at the level of molecular genetics. 
              Corazonin (CRZ) is a neuropeptide that regulates cardiac function in some
              insects but not others, and its gene (Crz) also has a potential but not yet
              clear role in the biological clock of Drosophila.  During development, a
              portion of corazonin-producing neurons appears to undergo programmed cell death
              (apoptosis).  This project uses molecular biological and physiological
              approaches to examine the gene expression patterns of the corazonin gene, to
              manipulate its activities, to identify regulatory elements in the genetic
              promoter of Crz, and to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell
              death of neurons expressing the corazonin gene.  The experiments address the
              important question of how these peptidergic neurons are regulated by genetic
              and external factors such as hormones and photoperiod during development. 
              Results will be extremely important to understanding the little-studied genetic
              mechanisms of neuropeptide function. 
   The impact will extend to the fields
              of biological rhythms, developmental neuroscience, and neuroendocrinology.  As
              a CAREER grant, the project will promote the career of an excellent young
              investigator, and will have a substantial impact on undergraduate biology by
              training undergraduates in modern techniques of molecular genetics and by
              developing new curricular offerings in the rapidly growing field of molecular
              neuroscience.
