Abstract    :
              The project addresses the issues of tracking and modeling of human motion.
              Robust tracking algorithms will be developed that do not require manual
              initialization and are capable of tracking over many frames without failure.
              These trackers will then be applied to archival video footage, to produce a
              rich corpus of historically-significant motion data. A combination of manual
              labeling, state invariant detection, and temporal co-occurrence analysis will
              be utilized to parse motions into sequences of movements. The generated 
              library of learned motions can then be applied to a diverse set of
              applications, including robot control and computer animation. The education
              part of the project calls for development of  a curriculum for figure tracking
              and motion modeling that is self-contained and accessible to students and
              researchers in the areas of computer vision, robotics, computer graphics, and
              biomechanics. An outreach program will be initiated that will  target the
              machine learning and computer animation communities.
