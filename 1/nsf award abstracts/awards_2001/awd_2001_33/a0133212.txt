Abstract    :
              An approach in which students become teachers by using algorithm visualization
              technology not only to construct their own visualizations, but also to present
              those visualizations to their instructor and peers for feedback and discussion
              will be studied within the context of a third-year, undergraduate computer
              science course on computer algorithms.  This approach will be used to develop a
              studio-based algorithms course in which the construction and discussion of
              visualizations are the central activities of the course.  Specifically,
              students will use algorithm visualization technology to construct their own
              visual solutions to algorithm design and analysis problems. In a variety of
              regularly scheduled review sessions, they will present their solutions to
              instructors and peers for feedback, discussion, and evaluation.  This research
              will yield several products and outcomes from which science educators,
              educational researchers, visualization technologists, and cognitive
              anthropologists stand to benefit.
