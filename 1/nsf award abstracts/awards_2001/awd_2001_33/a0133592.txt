Abstract    :
              The goal of the project is to bridge the gap between human and machine vision by
              designing active vision systems modeled after neurobiology. Such systems can
              benefit from the ability to make eye, head, and body movements for active
              sensing, and can learn robust models of the visual world directly from
              interaction with the environment. Computational models of active vision will be
              formulated within the context of  neurobiological data, addressing the problems
              of object identification, detection, attention, tracking, modeling self-motion,
              and oculomotor learning. An anthropomorphic real-time binocular active vision
              system will be designed based on commercially available camera platforms and
              real-time image processing hardware. The performance of the approach will be
              evaluated on both wheeled and legged robots in tasks involving visual
              navigation and multi-robot collaboration. The education part of the project
              includes development of an interdisciplinary curriculum in computational
              neuroscience.
