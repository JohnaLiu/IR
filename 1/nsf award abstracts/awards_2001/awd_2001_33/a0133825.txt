Abstract    :
              This research project will first develop efficient indexing strategies for
              spatio-temporal data sets. This will include access methods for future
              spatio-temporal queries as well as access methods for historical
              spatio-temporal queries. The next step will develop mining techniques for
              spatio-temporal databases. Finally the project will generate spatio-temporal
              data sets for experimentation. The career development plan will include two new
              courses on advanced database applications.
