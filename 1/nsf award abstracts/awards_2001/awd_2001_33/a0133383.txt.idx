Abstract    :
              This award will enable junior investigators to participate in the workshop
              entitled "MENU 2001," to be held at Georgetown University, July 26-31, 2001. 
              The workshop will focus on several current issues in hadron spectroscopy,
              including the so-called "missing resonance" question, and the production of
              strange particles.
