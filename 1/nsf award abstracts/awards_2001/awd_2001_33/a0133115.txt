Efficient Audio
              Compression with Perceptually Embedded Scalability

The focus of this project
              is to develop compression formats for audio data that are better suited to the
              integrated wireless/landline communications networks currently being developed
              and fielded.  The heterogeneous nature of such networks demands a compressed
              storage format from which fine layers of audio fidelity can be extracted; thus,
              each listener on the communications network receives as many layers of audio
              fidelity (i.e., the best quality audio reproduction) that his or her
              communications channel can support, all extracted from this single compressed
              representation.  An obvious application of such technology is music-on-demand
              over forthcoming wireless services like 3G cellular and Bluetooth.  A finely
              layered or 'scalable' bit stream can also be used to improve the streaming of
              real-time audio over the Internet or a broadcast wireless channel by
              simplifying rate buffer control and error protection.

The research here
              concentrates on developing a high-performance compression algorithm whose
              scalability is optimized for perceptual performance over the entire range of
              output fidelities. Most of the audio compression algorithms in wide use today--
              MP3 (MPEG audio layer 3), MPEG AAC, Dolby Digital, etc.-- do not support
              bitstream scalability.  Within the frameworks of MPEG 2 and MPEG 4,
              fine-grained scalability is supported using a technique called bit slice
              arithmetic coding (BSAC).  Unfortunately, subjective testing has shown that
              BSAC's scalability is not optimized for perceived sound quality at lower
              bitrates.  To more closely tie the bit allocation process to the perceived
              quality, a non-uniform multirate filter bank is used here whose frequency
              resolution approximates that of the critical bands of human hearing. 
              Quantization within each critical band is then performed in an optimal,
              multistage manner using both vector and scalar techniques.
