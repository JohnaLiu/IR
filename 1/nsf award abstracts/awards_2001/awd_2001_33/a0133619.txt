Abstract    :
              This project seeks to understand how students build mathematical reasoning
              skills through working with teachers on geometric proofs.  Although the NCTM
              Standards put an emphasis on students' development of these skills, teachers
              often do not know how to effectively use proofs to assist students.  This
              project will focus on understanding the dynamics of working with proofs that
              occur between teachers, students, and the subject matter.  The proposer will
              conduct classroom observations, interviews, and focus groups with teachers. 
              Replacement units will be used by the teachers during some observations that
              will allow for both descriptive observation as well as flexibility in the
              treatment conditions.   The researcher will use this research in his teaching
              in several ways.  Preservice teachers will be invited to spend part of their
              practicum in the observation classes.   Several courses will be created
              including a master's-level course on teaching and learning of geometry.  The
              research will also infuse an existing course on conceptualization in
              mathematics.
