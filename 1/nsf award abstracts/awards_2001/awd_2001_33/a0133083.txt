Abstract    :
              This is a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award.  The research
              component will employ eye tracking and other means to infer the cognitive
              processes of people engaged in particular tasks, and will develop a
              computational framework, called mind-tracking architecture, for mapping
              observed actions to the unobserved thoughts that produce them.  This work will
              draw upon existing psychology and engineering research and synthesize these
              efforts into a unified methodology.  The project will employ two frameworks at
              different levels to achieve mind tracking: the production-system architecture
              ACT-R and cognitive grammars that represent behavior as rules from intentions
              to actions.  Three specific application areas will motivate, demonstrate, and
              test the methodology: intelligent tutoring, automobile driver assistance, and
              assistive technology for the disabled.  The educational component will develop
              a new human-computer interaction curriculum and an outreach program to foster
              communication among students, researchers and industry professionals.

This
              CAREER award recognizes and supports the early career-development activities of
              a teacher-scholar who is likely to become an academic leader of the
              twenty-first century.  Each of the three application areas has the potential
              for significant benefit to members of the general public: students, drivers,
              and the disabled.
