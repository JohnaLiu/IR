              CAREER: A Unified Theory of Pseudorandomness
Salil P. Vadhan

During the past
              few decades, randomization has become one of the most
pervasive paradigms in
              computer science.  The best known solutions to
many problems in algorithms,
              cryptography, reliable communication,
network design, combinatorics, and
              distributed computing surprisingly
involve making random choices.  Thus
              randomness appears to be very
useful, but it is still not known to what extent
              it is truly
necessary.  Thus, this research asks: is it possible to reduce or
              even
eliminate the need for randomness in the above settings? 
              The
investigators address this question via the paradigm of
Pseudorandomness,
              which is the theory of efficiently generating
objects that "look random"
              despite being constructed using little or
no randomness.

Specifically, this
              research builds upon deep connections recently
discovered between four
              pseudorandom objects, namely pseudorandom
generators, expander graphs,
              error-correcting codes, and extractors.
The investigators seek to strengthen
              these connections and use them to
attack some of the open problems in the
              area, such as the construction
of expander graphs with optimal expansion, the
              derandomization of
space-bounded computation, and a complete understanding of
              the
relationship between derandomization and circuit lower bounds.
Students
              at all levels are involved in the research, including
undergraduates who
              explore conjectures about expander graphs through
computer experiments.  The
              research is tightly integrated into new
courses being developed by the
              investigators, including a graduate
course on Pseudorandomness, which focuses
              on the unified theory that
is emerging; and an undergraduate course on
              Cryptography, which
emphasizes the role of pseudorandomness in modern
              cryptography.
