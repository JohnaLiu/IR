Abstract    :
              This project focuses on studying general purpose visual tracking systems.  A
              model-based approach will be used, emphasizing the particular class of objects
              to be tracked. The tracking procedure is to be based on solving partial
              differential equations describing curve flow. Schemes for performing tracking
              will be developed based on intensity information, which is contained within the
              region of the curve in question. Faster, more effective, and more robust 
              trackers  will be generated by extending the general framework via
              generalization of the assumptions used, and through formal analysis of the
              related  PDEs. Also addressed will be  the more general problem of combining
              shape and intensity-based information; as above, the algorithm will also look
              for intensity patterns that match what it knows about the class of objects to
              be tracked. The education part of the project includes curriculum development,
              undergraduate independent studies,  and exposure of a large number students to
              an experimental system designed by the PI.
