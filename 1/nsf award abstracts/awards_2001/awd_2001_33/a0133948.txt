Abstract    :
              This research project will develop a robust unsupervised clustering technique
              based on Genetic Niching. It includes the development of a statistical
              estimator and to use this estimator in a Baldwin learning scheme. It will also
              develop an evolutionary web personalization system as well as techniques for
              preprocessing web usage data. The career development plan will include training
              graduate students in web mining as well as integrating the results into the
              undergraduate curriculum.
