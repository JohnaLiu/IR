Abstract    :
              Collaborating groups are dynamic affairs in which patterns of activity, working
              styles, levels of interaction, information structures and other elements emerge
              dynamically in response to the circumstances and settings in which work is
              carried out. In contrast, the technologies that we offer to support
              collaboration are static and rigid. Conventional software architectures support
              only limited degrees of adaptation and dynamic response. Combining analysis,
              design, and evaluation, this research investigates metalevel architectures, an
              alternative approach supporting radically dynamic application response. If
              successful, this will yield both applications and application platforms which
              provide much more seamless support for collaboration than is currently
              possible. It also forges new connections between the two major areas of CSCW
              research, social analysis and technical design. The complex relationship
              between these two areas of interest is a major challenge to research and
              teaching. This research further supports the training of a new generation of
              CSCW researchers who are not just familiar with both halves of the puzzle, but
              have the skills to put them together.
