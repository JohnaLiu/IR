Abstract    :
              The experience of providing or receiving medical care has a very
personal
              dimension.  Quoted from the Hippocratic oath:
"Whatsoever I shall see or hear
              in the course of my dealings with
men, if it be what should not be published
              abroad, I will never
divulge, holding such things to be holy secrets".  The
              1996
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
required the
              Administration to issue regulations protecting the
privacy of health
              information. Such a regulation gives consumers
the right to see, copy, and
              correct their own health information
and the right of being notified as to how
              their health
information is going to be used and shared. It also imposes
              new
restrictions on those who hold health information.
However, legal
              protection alone is not enough as it can only be
applied after the problem has
              occurred, when the damage has
already been done. Moreover, law enforcement is
              usually
expensive, slow, and complex.  The goal of this project is to
design
              a comprehensive technical infrastructure that guarantees
the enforcement of
              health information privacy protection.  The
problem of data protection and
              privacy is addressed on a
technical level, thus preventing any violation of a
              privacy
policy in advance rather than correcting it after it has
occurred. 
              The intend of the project is to demonstrate that
health information privacy
              solutions can be designed to achieve
meaningful benefits without penalizing
              society with undue
financial burdens or worse, with the compromise of public
              safety.
