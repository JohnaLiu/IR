Abstract    :
              The objective of this research, funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular
              Biosciences and the Division of Chemistry, is to use an integrated approach of
              theory and computation to understand  variations in quantum yield of tryptophan
              fluorescence in proteins.  A custom hybrid quantum mechanical-molecular
              dynamics method will be applied to the higher charge transfer excited states
              instead of the electrostatic effects on fluorescence wavelength from the 1La
              state to predict tryptophan fluorescence wavelength shifts due to protein
              electric fields and solvation.  The study will consider the possibility of both
              short and long-range electron transfer  to (or from) at least the following
              implicated sources: the peptide backbone, protonated carboxylates (Glu and
              Asp), amide side chains (Asn and Gln), histidine, cysteine, disulfide bonds,
              and aromatic groups.  The goal is to determine if there exists a correlation
              between fluorescence quantum yield and the incidence of charge transfer states
              that are particularly low in energy due to extreme electrostatic potential
              differences and/or propitious solvation, using semiempirical and ab initio
              quantum mechanics applied to super molecular pairs consisting of tryptophan and
              a putative electron acceptor/donor.  At least 20 proteins with a full range of
              quantum yields, along with well-studied model compounds will be included in the
              study. 

Insight into the details of quenching is of practical importance
              because the protein fluorescence is used routinely by scientists to follow a
              myriad of transformations involving structural changes in the protein, for
              example, folding, unfolding, ligand binding, redox reactions, binding to other
              proteins, etc., all dynamic events for which structural information is often
              lacking.  This work should add new and useful knowledge to the field of
              long-range electron transfer in proteins, which is central to photosynthesis
              and bioenergetics.
