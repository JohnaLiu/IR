Abstract    :
              The proposed research concerns computational principles of touch sensing in the
              context of part localization, model-based recognition,  and shape
              reconstruction; it encompasses a number of areas of robotics - touch sensing,
              part orientation and localization, shape recognition, grasping, dextrous
              manipulation. The proposed localization scheme aims at determining the pose  of
              an object with known geometry relative to the (robot) hand through contact.
              Algorithms will be developed for processing tactile data, computing geometric
              invariants, and registering them onto the object's surface. The education part
              of the project includes development of interdisciplinary courses with an
              emphasis on robotics and geometric computation.
