Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to use control-theoretic techniques to develop new
              processor-architecture mechanisms for dynamically adaptable control of power
              and temperature.  To accurately evaluate
the effectiveness of these new
              mechanisms, this project will also develop more detailed models for localized
              temperatures within a processor and for leakage current within on-chip,
              memory-like structures.  These models will be constructed for computationally
              efficient use in cycle-accurate power/performance processor simulation.
