Abstract    :
              DSP-Enhanced Low-Voltage Signal Processing in Submicron CMOS

Today's
              electronic systems are strongly influenced by the dramatic advancement of
              submicron complementary metal-oxide-silicon (CMOS) integrated circuits (IC)
              technology as the size of transistors shrink to extreme dimensions. Because of
              the shrinking size of transistors, the digital signal processing (DSP) power
              and efficiency of digital computation grow exponentially; however, the equally
              decreasing operating voltage of the transistors leads to design problems for
              mixed analog-digital circuits which are part of all digital processors. By
              taking advantage of the CMOS down-scaling trend that increases DSP capability,
              this research combines the developmental efforts in both low-voltage analog
              circuit techniques and optimum architectures for DSP enhancements. This
              research systematically explores various architectures, develops and
              compares
adaptive algorithms and digital correction techniques, studies the
              effects of analog imperfections in deep submicron CMOS, and obtains the
              fundamental limits of digital compensation and calibration.

In this
              research, two IC design methods are created and expanded to overcome the
              analog/mixed-signal design challenges of very deep submicron CMOS technologies.
              The first explores new architectures and techniques capable of maximizing the
              power of DSP for enhancing analog and mixed-signal circuit performance,
              including DSP-enabling architectures, use of multi-signal paths and taking
              advantage of inherent structures for error estimation, and merged system
              calibration of multi-stage architectures. The second explores new analog
              circuit design techniques for ultra low-voltage operation that is fully
              compatible with submicron CMOS, focusing on fast low-voltage switching schemes,
              analog-error insensitive and DSP-corrected low-voltage structures, and linear
              low-voltage input sampling circuits.
