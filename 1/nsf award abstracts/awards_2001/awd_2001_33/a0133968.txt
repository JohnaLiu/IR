Abstract    :
              The focus in modern computer networks has started to shift towardsservices and
              functionality rather than efficiency andoptimization. This calls for algorithms
              that combine user-centricperformance metrics such as fairness, availability,
              and latency withmore traditional objectives such as the total bandwidth cost or
              totalthroughput; it is desirable for these algorithms to provide
              formalguarantees in abstract models, as well as general rules of thumb
              forsystem developers. This research involves the study of severalproblems
              within the above framework.The first problem is to design efficient distributed
              algorithms forachieving approximate fairness in computer networks, and to
              studysimple mechanisms that induce convergence of selfish users toapproximately
              fair solutions. The second problem is to study routingissues in peer-to-peer
              systems; peer-to-peer systems are groups ofend-nodes that collaborate to
              implement new network services at theapplication level. Another problem is to
              study the packet-injectionrate at which common packet scheduling protocols such
              as FIFO becomeunstable.In an attempt to overcome the gap between theoreticians
              andpractitioners in this field, a new course titled "Algorithms forcomputer
              networks" will be developed, and the course material will bemade publicly
              available. Another course titled "Modern algorithmictechniques" will also be
              developed.
