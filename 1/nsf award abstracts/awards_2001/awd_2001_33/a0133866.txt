Abstract    :
              Dr. Tracy A. Hanna, Department of Chemistry, Texas Christian University is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              of the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for her work under a
              CAREER Award to study solution models for SOHIO oxidation/ammoxidation
              catalysis.  The SOHIO process is used industrially to oxidize propylene to
              acrolein and to effect the ammoxidation of the same feedstock to produce
              acrylonitrile.  The active SOHIO catalyst involves both bismuth and molybdenum.
               The objectives of this research are to investigate the formation and
              reactivity of bismuth(II) radicals and prepare bimetallic calixarene-supported
              models of the SOHIO catalytic components.

This research is integrated with
              undergraduate education, outreach programs, international collaboration and the
              inclusion of under-represented groups. In conjunction with this, both advanced
              and introductory chemistry courses at TCU are being reshaped and modernized. 
              Primary components include the development and implementation of a
              "write-your-own" laboratory program in general chemistry, curricular reform,
              web-based course material development, and the incorporation of peer
              instruction.
