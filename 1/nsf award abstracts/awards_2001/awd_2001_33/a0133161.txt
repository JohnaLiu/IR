Abstract    :
              This effort explores the feasibility of extending the dilution limit of an
              engine during cold-start conditions by using reformer gas and characterizes
              experimentally the chemical interactions of reformer gas with
              large-carbon-number hydrocarbon fuels representative of gasoline over a range
              of pressures, temperatures, and equivalence ratios.  The investigation includes
              determination of flame speed with digital particle-imaging velocitmetry (DPIV)
              using a counterflow burner, and characterization of oxidation scattering, and
              planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) using a piston reactor.  Engine
              experiments are conducted to determine the effect from the use of reformer gas
              on cold-start hydrocarbon emissions.

Under the education plan, research
              findings are integrated into course development.  The program also includes
              outreach efforts at the precollege level including science project advising,
              classroom visits, hands on laboratory sessions, and laboratory
              demonstrations.
