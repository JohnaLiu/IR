Abstract    :
              Abstract:
Exposure-Resilient Cryptography concerns the important problem of
              key
exposure and general information leakage.  Exposure of such
information
              poses one of the most serious and common threats to
employing cryptography in
              real life. For example, cryptographic
computations (decryption, signature
              generation, etc.) are often
performed on a relatively insecure device (e.g., a
              mobile device or an
Internet-connected host) which cannot be trusted to
              maintain secrecy
of the private key. Thus, the goal of Exposure-Resilient
              Cryptography
is to design solutions that will limit (or even completely
              eliminate)
the negative consequences of such an exposure in various
              cryptographic
scenarios. In particular, this research concentrates on the
              design of
various key evolving schemes and the problem of partial key
              exposure.

The paradigm of secret key evolution over time invloves updating
              one's
secret key such that key leakage at given period(s) compromises
              the
security of other periods to the minimal extent possible.
              The
investigators examine two such models. Forward-secure schemes
              update
secret key locally, and seek to protect the security of all the
              past
periods when the current key is exposed. In
              contrast,
bidirectionally-secure schemes use secure key updates, but
              protect
all non-exposed periods: both in the past and in the future. 
              In
either model, the public information (e.g., public keys) are not
affected
              by the secret key evolution. The problem of partial key
exposure concerns the
              scenario where most but not all secret
information has been leaked. The main
              question studied in this setting
is how can valuable secret information be
              stored or represented in
such a way that almost complete exposure of its
              representation still
guarantees the secrecy of the actual, embedded secret?
