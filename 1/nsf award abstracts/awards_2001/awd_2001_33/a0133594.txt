The objective of the proposed research is to study T lymphocyte
              (T cell) regulation at the intracellular level, with a focus on molecular
              signaling processes initiated by the cell surface receptors for the cytocines,
              interleukins (IL)-2 and (IL)-4.  The specific objectives of this research
              include: (1) the quantitative analysis of pathway crosstalk interactions in
              IL-2 receptor signaling, using interventions that target specific intracellular
              molecules, (2) the characterization of the cooperation of IL-2
              receptor-mediated signaling pathways in mediating T cell life (proliferation)
              and death (apoptosis) decision making, and (3) the elucidation of the
              synergistic effect of IL-2 and IL-4 on T cell expansion at the level of
              signaling network interactions.  This research could provide new information to
              help modulate cell function, with potential application being the elucidation
              of therapeutic strategies.
