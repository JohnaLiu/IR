Abstract    :
              The project focuses on robotic tasks that cannot be done by a single robot, with
              the goal of developing multi-robot systems with increased fault tolerance and
              task speedup. This domain will be studied formally, in pursuit of a fundamental
              theory. The resulting formalism is to guide researchers in the design of
              experiments with large-scale multi-robot systems. Macroscopic models using
              expected (rather than exact) values of the system states will be explored in
              the search of a theory of multi-robot teams. Models of large-scale robot teams
              will be designed, and testable hypotheses about system performance will be
              formulated. Scalable algorithms for certain canonical tasks in a planar
              environment will be designed and tested,  using a large group of mobile robots
              and a multi-robot simulator. The education part of the project is closely tied
              to the PI's research, and includes a new teaching lab, lab courseware
              development, and hosting high-school minority summer interns at the lab.
