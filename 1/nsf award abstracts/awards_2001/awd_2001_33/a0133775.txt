Under this CAREER Award, efforts will be made to systematically
              understand the structural mechanisms of microvessel wall controlling the
              transport of water, molecules and cells in order to design new drug and drug
              delivery methods.  In particular, the proposal focuses on developing approaches
              to investigate the mechanisms by which VEGF induces permeability of
              individually perfused microvessels in frog mesentery and how that permeability
              is influenced by cAMP.   

The educational component of the plan focuses on
              creating research education seminars and conferences, supervising graduate
              students, creating new graduate level courses, relevant introductory
              undergraduate courses and providing research training for undergraduate and
              high school students, including outreach efforts to women and minorities and
              developing international research/education  collaborations with West China
              Medical University and the National University of Singapore.
