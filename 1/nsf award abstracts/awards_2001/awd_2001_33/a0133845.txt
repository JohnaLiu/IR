Abstract    :
              This project investigates two important elements in intelligent multiagent
              systems: decision making and learning. Based on a theoretical model of dynamic
              games, the PI will investigate a new optimality criterion for decision making.
              Second, the PI will define a non-stationary strategy within a dynamic game
              framework, providing a language to describe the policy choices. Third, the PI
              will provide a framework to describe the interaction between learning and
              action choice, and redefine the concept of online learning. Fourth, the PI will
              search for efficient online learning algorithms to reach an optimal
              non-stationary strategy. Fifth, this research on non-stationary strategy
              learning will be linked to research on models for dynamic single-agent systems.
              Finally, the proposed methodology and algorithms will be implemented in agent
              applications for E-commerce domains and computer games. Potential applications
              include bidding agents for online auctions, pricebots for online retailers and
              computer characters for strategic games. The proposed research is integrated
              with the PI's education plan, which focuses on promoting the concept of
              intelligence for multiagent systems. The PI will teach decision making and
              learning in dynamic games in her Ph.D. seminar class, and construct a graduate
              course on agent design for multiagent systems and their applications in
              electronic commerce.
