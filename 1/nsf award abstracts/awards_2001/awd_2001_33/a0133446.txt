Abstract    :
              The investigator would investigate the  role of context in critical thinking
              (making sure an author's points are clearly backed by evidence) across popular
              media.  What are the needs of everyday critical thinkers and how can their
              needs be fulfilled?  It will develop tools and training based on this research
              and train parents and teachers on the use of these tools.  Then it will
              evaluate whether participation affects user practice.

The researcher will
              examine the personal and social impact of scientific information from three
              studies of evolutionary science as perceived by college students and adults. 
              It will concentrate on public understanding of the human genome project and
              human learning strategies. The project will use web-based forums as a vehicle
              for investigating these understandings.  The interactions of teachers and
              students with the Web will be evaluated to determine whether informative tools
              that support student strategies and reflective exercises are needed.
