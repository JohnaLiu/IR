Abstract    :
              This project involves studies of chlorine atom (Cl) initiated oxidation of
              volatile organic compounds (VOC) and subsequent formation of secondary organic
              aerosol (SOA). Laboratory studies will be carried out in a smog chamber where
              reaction will be initiated by photolysis of molecular chlorine, and products
              will be studied using Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry and other types of
              detectors. Field studies will be carried out with the goal of finding unique
              markers of Cl-initiated chemistry. Computer models will be modified to include
              detailed chlorine chemistry, and will be used to interpret the laboratory and
              field data. This research project will develop new tools to study the chemistry
              of chlorine in the atmosphere and provide new information on the role of this
              potentially important oxidant.

For the education component of this project,
              the PI will develop innovative coursework, integrate the results of his
              research into his teaching, and provide research opportunities for
              undergraduate students. The PI will also participate in a Summer Environmental
              Enrichment Program (SEEP) designed to encourage the participation of women and
              members of underrepresented minorities in the environmental sciences and
              engineering. Efforts will also be directed towards improving retention of
              engineering students at Duke University.
