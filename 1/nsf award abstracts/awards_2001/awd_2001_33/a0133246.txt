Abstract    :
              This research and education program is directed at devising theoretical
              frameworks and methodological strategies for designing and employing learning
              objects in scalable online learning environments that are rich with
              human-to-human interaction. To develop these new frameworks and strategies,
              empirical program based on qualitative analyses of existing online learning
              communities will be done. Rather than viewing learning objects as
              decontextualized artifacts existing independent of learners interactions with
              them, Wertsch's (1991) analytic method will allow the research to focus on the
              ways in which resources mediate the achievement of online learners' goals in
              the context of existing online learning communities. 

The research will be
              integrated into several educational activities. Three full graduate
              assistantships are provided for the five years of the grant, which will engage
              students in Utah State University's Instructional Technology graduate program
              in real-world application of skills they are learning, as well as prepare them
              for future research projects of their own. Additionally, the grant will serve
              as a real-world context for assignments in a variety of courses such as
              qualitative methods courses and a Learning Objects Seminar. Thirdly, as
              portions of the framework become available courses will be designed around the
              framework, giving both myself and the students the opportunity to engage
              reflectively in their own integrated learning and research activities.

This
              project is co-funded by Division of Undergraduate Education.
