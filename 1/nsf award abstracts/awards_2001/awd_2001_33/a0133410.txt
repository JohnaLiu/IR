Abstract    :
              This award is for the support of the third joint workshop of Task Committee D
              (Wind Engineering) of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Program on Natural Resources
              (UJNR). This workshop is an ongoing effort of the UJNR Panel on Wind and
              Seismic Effects to bring together U.S. and Japanese researchers from academic
              institutions, government laboratories and industry to discuss the
              state-of-the-art of wind effects on civil engineering structures and develop
              strategies and collaborative efforts that will benefit both countries. The
              theme of this workshop is "Reducing Losses from Wind: Collaborative
              Opportunities for the 21st Century" and it will be held in Seattle, U.S. on
              October 2-5, 2002. The purpose of this workshop is to (a) discuss previous
              collaborative research efforts, (b) continue mutual exchange of technical
              information on ongoing research, (c) identify collaborative opportunities for
              the 21st century and develop strategic planning that will benefit both the
              countries, (d) identify specific projects for collaborative research, and (e)
              visit selected sites in the Seattle area related to wind effects on structures.
