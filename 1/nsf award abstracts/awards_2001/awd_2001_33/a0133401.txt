Abstract    :
              The goal of this research program is to explore tools, models, and design
              practices that shed light on the relationship between silicon technology and
              the direction of future EDA tools. The current education, research, and
              commercial semiconductor and EDA communities are set up in a way that virtually
              guarantees a knowledge gap between the cutting edge of CMOS technology and
              state-of-the-art design automation. The best current example of this knowledge
              gap is on-chip inductance. A large part of this project focuses on developing
              models, metrics, and design approaches to assess and ameliorate the impact of
              inductance on circuit performance. This includes a range of RLC-based models
              varying in accuracy and complexity that target different stages of the design
              flow ranging from standard cell characterization to late-mode full-chip timing.
              Other impending knowledge gaps being studied in this research program include:
              1) standard cell interconnect libraries to leverage predictability and maintain
              performance, and 2) scalable global signaling alternatives to CMOS repeaters
              for nanometer design (feature sizes < 100 nm).  The education component of this
              CAREER program has two broad aims: 1) introduce students to the role of on-chip
              interconnect on circuit performance early and often, and 2) transfer a diverse
              population of students to industry with relevant design experience via group
              design projects.
