Abstract    :
              The research focuses on new approaches for exposing concurrency and improving
              performance in modern
superscalar microprocessors.  These approaches include
              semantic decomposition of instruction 
sets and bitslice decomposition of data
              paths to expose elements of the processor's control and data path 
to allow
              flexible, programmable control over at least a subset of the microarchitectural
              features 
that are available.  Preliminary analysis shows that there are
              significant opportunities for reducing ALU 
cycle time, power consumption, and
              the deleterious effects of wire delay with little or no harmful 
effects on
              throughput measured in instructions per cycle.  Further, the research proposes
              pre-execution 
using partial operand knowledge to resolve conditional
              branches, identify references that miss the cache, and mitigate the effects of
              other problematic instructions.

The primary objectives of the proposed
              educational plan are to integrate advanced topics into the 
University of
              Wisconsin's computer architecture curriculum at the graduate and undergraduate
              level; 
to continue to involve undergraduate students in research to enhance
              their educational experience 
via exposure to leading-edge research topics; to
              incorporate advanced pedagogic techniques into the 
classroom environment in
              order to accommodate all learning styles; and to exploit emerging web-based
              
technologies to streamline interactive and off-line communication between
              instructor and students.
