Abstract    :
              Abstract:

The ever-increasing sophistication of computerized devices,
be
              they handheld electronic organizers or laptop computers,
demands an equally
              sophisticated means of synchronizing data
on these various devices.  For
              example, an appointment schedule
modified on a handheld organizer might need
              to be synchronized with
a laptop business machine or a desktop home
              computer.
The limited communication power of these devices, combined
              with
their increasing numbers, means that it is no longer feasible to
simply
              compare all data on the devices and resolve differences.
Instead, this
              research investigates mathematical techniques for
summarizing data.  By
              comparing such summaries of their data,
devices can resolve differences with
              surprisingly little communication.

More specifically, this investigator
              studies practical data
synchronization techniques that minimize communication
              complexity,
building upon a foundation of recent research connecting
              these
techniques to graph coloring problems and the design of
              error-control
codes.  Preliminary results offer practical solutions
              that
require communication dependent only on the number of
              differences
between synchronizing systems and not generally on the overall
              size of
these systems.  The research subsists on an attainable
educational
              plan that is based on immersing high school and
undergraduate students in
              properly focused components of the
work, supported by collaborating graduate
              students.  Moreover, fruits
of the research have and will continue to be
              integrated innovatively
