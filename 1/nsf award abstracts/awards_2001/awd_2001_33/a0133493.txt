Title: CAREER:
              Economical and Simple Fabrication of Quantum Dot-Electronics Using
              Biofunctionalized Protein Nanotubes as Building Blocks

The project involves
              a blending of molecular biology, nanotechnology, and materials physics, in an
              attempt to create a new class of electronics.  A new architecture for
              nanostructures using biologically modified metal /semiconductor coated protein
              ananotube and quantum dots are being created that will inherently be high
              speed, light weight, high stability, and low power consumption.

The
              architecture being used is a form of molecular self-assembly based on
              biological models.  The protein nanotubes are formed from tubular peptide
              templates, which can be coated with various semiconductors, metals, and quantum
              dots.  By functionalizing the end of the tubes with specific protein molecules,
              the nanotubes can use biological recognition, modeled after the biological
              antibody-antigen interactions, to attach the wire end to the appropriate
              substrate location.  This strategy is at the center of the fabrication method
              being investigated.  Designs of electronics devices are built into
              nanostructures by themselves, rather than having to be imposed afterwards using
              a patterning process.  The functionality of this biological recognition is one
              of the major advantages as compared with other nanotubes. 

The project is
              having a significant educational benefit for the graduate, undergraduate and
              high school students in this interdisciplinary research ranging from
              spectroscopy to materials characterization.  A summer Nanotechnology laboratory
              course is being offered to talented high school students.
