"Linear precoding methods for high bit
              rate wireless
transmission
	over time-varying broadband channels"

It is
              predictable that in the near future computing and multimedia applications will
              be supported by unique mobile devices that will be capable of transmitting and
              receiving various type of information (images, audio, data). These devices will
              use a unique interface based on the Internet, a common transfer protocol
              based
on IP and will be supported by ubiquitous wireless coverage.  However,
              the communication technology used today is inadequate to support this progress
              without generating a spiraling demand for bandwidth.  As bandwidth becomes a
              low-margin commodity, certain technological barriers need to be surpassed
              starting from the physical layer. Using the modulation paradigm that we refer
              to as "linear precoding" this project researches designs that allow high bit
              rate packet transmission over broadband frequency selective
time-varying
              channels.  The block transmission model in the linear precoding framework
              provides a very general setting to determine the optimal or most cost-effective
              multiple access technique for packet transmission. The outreach of this project
              is the development of physical layer solutions for packet transmission that: 1)
              minimize the overhead bandwidth dedicated to training, error correction coding
              and precoding jointly; 2) adapt to time-varying channels ; 3) can incorporate
              an arbitrary number of
transmit and receive antennas; 4) can support multiple
              access packet transmission, allowing different quality of service requirements
              in terms of rate, decoding delay and complexity. The mathematical framework of
              linear precoding is not only an useful tool for research but also for teaching,
              since it allows a unified description of the principles of wideband and high
              bit rate transmission, including schemes such as antenna diversity, spread
              spectrum and multicarrier transmissions as special cases.
