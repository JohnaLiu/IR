Abstract    :
              The researcher's agenda over the next decade is to improve the robustness of
              network communication services to the point that they are suitable for
              applications that depend on assured connectivity. In this proposal, the
              researcher  focuses on the key goal of containing the effects of router
              misconfigurations, implementation bugs in routing protocols, and other insider
              faults that, if left unchecked, can cause widespread loss of connectivity. 

              
Dependable communications are of clear importance as critical applications in
              the areas of aviation, 
medical services, emergency services, utilities and
              defense become integrated with the Internet. Yet the Internet today cannot be
              depended on because the routing protocols that provide connectivity are
              themselves fragile. They take a bimodal approach to security: well-developed
              cryptographic techniques are used to authenticate trusted entities and protect
              the protocol from untrusted attackers, but no further checks are placed on the
              information provided by an entity once it has been authenticated.  The result
              is that once an inadvertent error or attacker slips in, the scope of error is
              potentially unbounded. As one example of a well-known, spectacular failure,
              misconfiguration at a Virginia-based ISP caused most Internet backbone traffic
              to be misdirected for up to two hours in April 1997. Data from one study of
              Internet failures suggests that insider faults account for roughly five times
              more trouble tickets than malicious attacks, such as denial-of-service.  
The
              researcher proposes to work towards the design of routing protocols that are
              able to efficiently tolerate the above kind of insider faults. Detecting and
              containing these faults is a challenging problem because traditional security
              techniques are often ineffective. For example, authentication can validate what
              entity sent which message, but not that the entity is behaving correctly. The
              key to his approach is to extend routing protocols with information that can be
              used by the participants to consistency-check the behavior of each other. This
              is a novel strategy that differs from most of the prior work, which is focused
              on adding security in the context of existing routing protocols. The researcher
               illustrates the approach in this proposal by describing his research on a
              robust congestion signaling protocol, where it was applied to substantial
              advantage in a related domain.  
 
To begin this work, the researcher will
              conduct a measurement study of configuration errors in BGP, the routing
              protocol used across the backbone of the Internet. I have already started this
              task, and include some preliminary results in the proposal. Such a study is
              important because there is little data to quantify the kind, prevalence or
              impact of insider faults. Armed with these results, the researcher will design
              routing protocols that limit the loss of connectivity caused by common faults.
              the researchers philosophy is to first put aside deployment considerations to
              focus on what can be achieved as a more fundamental result with a clean-slate
              design, and then map the designs into the context of existing routing
              protocols. Specifically, he will reason about the minimal mechanism required to
              handle different kinds of faults, and evaluate the costs of that mechanism by
              using a combination of implementation, simulation, and comparison to
              alternatives in the literature. The researcher's approach is also to tackle the
              simplest, non-malicious insider faults first and work towards progressively
              more complex classes of faults, rather than beginning with the design of a
              .Byzantine robust. protocol. This has the advantages of both breaking a known,
              hard problem into pieces, and exposing the increased computational costs of
              tolerating more complex faults. 
 
At all of the above stages, the researcher
              will cross-fertilize my research and education activities as described in the
              proposal.  The researcher will bring his research into the classroom to enliven
              lectures, and bring students, their projects, and overlapping infrastructure
              such as the proposed animations back into his research. If successful, this
              work will deepen the understanding of dependable network communication and how
              routing protocols can efficiently contain faults. This in turn will lay a
              foundation for research and education on dependable distributed systems that
              rely on the composition of routing protocols with other components such as
              transport protocols and name resolution.
