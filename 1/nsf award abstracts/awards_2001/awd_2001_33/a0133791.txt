Abstract    :
              Abstract:
With the virtual completion of the human DNA sequence
 research
              attention has shifted to issues including the resolution of the
 genetic
              composition, evolutionary history, and health impact of portions
 of the human
              genome which have proven difficult
 to sequence due to their duplicative and
              dynamic nature.
The proposed research aims to address these problems through

              the development of algorithms and software tools for
 discovery, resolution
              and evolutionary analysis of genomic
 duplications and other genome-wide
              segmental
 rearrangements.
The ultimate goal is to help understand mechanisms
              for
 and the sources of genetic disposition to
 genome-wide structural
              rearrangements.
Some of these structural rearrangements are known to cause
              dosage
imbalance
 of developmentally important genes during recombination
              events; as a
 result, genomic diseases, including several birth defects as
              well as
 a number of adult diseases occur at a rate of $\~1$ in every
              $1000$
births.
The premise of this research is that understanding the
              mechanisms
 under such segmental rearrangements may help improve methods
 for
              diagnosis, treatment and prevention of these genetic disorders.

The basic
              research components of the proposal
 are (1) identification of all chromosomal
              segments that are
 duplicated along the genome,
 (2) understanding the
              complex evolutionary relationships between
 these interesting segments through
              novel phylogenetic analysis
 algorithms for a single genome sequence, and

              (3) identification of the duplication
 order via known or derived properties
              of duplication mechanisms, and
 (4) development of similarity measures between
              genome sequences
 that involve not only point mutations but structural
              rearrangements,
 particularly duplications.
The short-term education goal of
              the proposal is to establish the
 algorithmic and the fundamental software
              development component of
 an interdisciplinary bioinformatics program at CWRU,
              that will provide
means
 of awarding M.S. and Ph.D. degrees within existing
              departmental
 degree-granting programs.
The long-term goal is to establish a
              free-standing
 graduate program in computational genomics,
 offering a
              wide-range of introductory and advanced level courses in
 bioinformatics.
To
              this end the investigator has developed and taught a new
 introductory
              graduate course on algorithmic issues in bioinformatics,
 with the involvement
              of students from both the Computer Science
 program and the School of Medicine
              at CWRU.
Funds from this proposal will be used to enhance this activity

              through the development of a new advanced level graduate course
 in
              computational genomics for in-depth training on
 individualized research
              topics, as well as an intensive summer research
 and training program for
              graduate and undergraduate students.
