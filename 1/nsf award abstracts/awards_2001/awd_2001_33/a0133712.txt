Abstract    :
              This project involves the research, development, and dissemination of techniques
              and tools necessary to perform rigorous, systematic processor design-space
              exploration.  The key element is a framework in
which architectural simulators
              and targeted compilers are automatically derived from a common architectural
              description, providing architects, microarchitects, and compiler developers
              with a
dynamic, yet coherent, environment within which to design processor
              systems.  Such a system would enhance productivity and design quality by
              tightening the loop between architectural decision-making and
realistic
              performance feedback and by allowing for more productive collaboration among
              the members of a prototyping team.  The resulting reduction in design cycle
              times will counter increasingly restrictive
market pressures, safeguarding the
              practicality of designing both new general-purpose microprocessors and
              application-specific processors (ASIPs), such as those found in networking
              hardware, cellular
telephones, and next-generation digital devices. 
              Additionally, this research will provide invaluable experiences for both
              undergraduate and graduate students in computer architecture and compilers. 
              This
same system is an ideal mechanism by which students can interact with
              tangible examples of computer architecture and compiler concepts -- it will
              allow them to rapidly prototype systems, experiment with new ideas, and thereby
              build intuition about computer systems.
