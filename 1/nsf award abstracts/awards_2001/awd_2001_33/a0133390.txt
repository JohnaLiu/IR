Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to advance theory and practice in the design,
              modeling and control of high performance communication networks. The scope of
              the project encompasses system-level issues in high-speed wireline networks,
              and interconnecting of wireline/wireless networks. The research component of
              the project will be directed in three focus areas: (1) switch architectures and
              control algorithms for high speed networks; (2) mobility, connectivity and
              control of wireless networks; and (3) network modeling and simulation
              methodologies. Our proposed program of research in these areas is expected to
              make significant contributions to the design, modeling and control of
              large-scale, high-speed, heterogeneous communication networks. Research and
              education will be integrated through the following activities: (1) supervision
              of graduate and undergraduate research projects; (2) co-authoring of a graduate
              level two-volume textbook on modeling and analysis of high performance
              networks; (3) teaching of undergraduate and graduate level courses in the area
              of communication networks; and (4) development and maintenance of an up-to-date
              data networking laboratory that will provide students with hands-on experience
              in the operation and configuration of modern networks.
