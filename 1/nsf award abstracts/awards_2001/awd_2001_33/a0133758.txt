Abstract    :
              Professor Ronald Fawcett of the University of California Davis is supported by
              the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to characterize the electrical
              double layer at single crystal gold microelectrode surfaces. Both novel
              experiments and theoretical studies will be performed.  Aqueous and nonaqueous
              solvents will be investigated.  Kinetic experiments will also be conducted at
              single crystal electrodes modified by a self-assembled monolayer.  Monte Carlo
              calculations will be carried out to determine ion/electrode correlation
              functions in the diffuse boundary layer. 

This fundamental work underlies
              the understanding of electrochemical capacitors, synthesis, sensors, corrosion
              and the preparation of new materials.
