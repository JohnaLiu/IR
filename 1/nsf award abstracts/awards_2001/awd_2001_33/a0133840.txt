              University  CAREER:  Weaving a Code Tapestry:  A Compiler Directed Framework
              for Scalable Network Emulation  

In this research, we propose a new scalable
              network emulation test-bed that supports both the simulation as well as direct
              code execution paradigms within a single framework.  In order to represent the
              scale and heterogeneity of the Internet, the test-bed scales to tens to
              hundreds of thousands of network nodes.  The first major challenge lies in
              developing programming models that can represent the digraph relationship of
              network protocol stacks within a single process, without manually modifying
              either the protocol stack or network applications.  Secondly, the enormous
              scope of the test bed requires us to address problems in inter application
              context switch time, memory usage and parallel discrete event simulation, all
              of which present bottlenecks to scalability.
