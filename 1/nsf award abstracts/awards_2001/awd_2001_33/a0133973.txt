Abstract    :
              This research project will address the problem of information overload by
              creating new document organization and presentation techniques. The approach
              will generate intelligent interfaces to the scientific literature. Existing
              knowledge bases will be used for the automatic generation of these interfaces.
              Categorizations and analyses of the search results will be used as the basis of
              an interactive interface to manage and share documents. The career development
              plan will include the use of real-world problems in biomedicine to motivate
              learning about information technology. It will also develop courses that
              promote interdisciplinary learning.
