In wireless
              broadband communications, the distortion that the communication medium (`the
              channel') causes on the transmitted signal, warrants accurate channel models in
              order to characterize and mitigate the distortion. These models need to take
              into account the mobility of the transmitter and receiver, the possible
              presence of a line-of-sight between the communicators, and the presence of
              noise and interference, all of which are parameters that quantify the channel
              quality, and affect the performance of the communication 
system. It is,
              therefore, of interest to construct such models, and use these models to
              estimate these statistical channel quality measures. It is the goal of this
              research to construct and utilize a signal processing framework to estimate
              these channel quality measures, which is expected to aid in the design of
              broadband systems with improved performance. 
More specifically, in the course
              of this research, the PI will construct optimal (maximum likelihood and minimum
              variance) as well as moment-based estimators for channel quality indicators
              such as the maximum Doppler spread, signal to interference plus noise ratio,
              and the Ricean factor for broadband systems such as OFDM. After characterizing
              the deleterious effects of the time-selective and frequency-selective channel
              on 
general block transmission systems, for which OFDM is a special case, the
              PI will devise generalized OFDM transceivers that reduce the adverse effects of
              the inter-carrier interference. Hence, the research will 
focus on the adverse
              effects of the randomly time-varying channel on broadband systems and propose
              novel, low-complexity remedies.
