Abstract    :
              Dr. Gary A. Lorigan of Miami University (Oxford, OH) is funded for his research
              in magnetic resonance studies of membrane proteins by a CAREER grant in the
              Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division and in the Molecular
              Biophysics program of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division.  He will
              develop model membrane systems that magnetically align at low magnetic fields
              for magnetic resonance studies.  A Q-band EPR spectrometer will be used to
              explore the structural and dynamic properties of model membrane systems and
              integral membrane proteins.  Dr. Lorigan will develop a modern biophysical
              chemistry curriculum for undergraduate and graduate students in both the
              classroom and the laboratory.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is an
              important technique that is rapidly becoming a standard tool in chemistry and
              biochemistry for the structural determination of proteins.  This research will
              allow biophysical chemists to investigate the structural and motional
              properties of biologically significant molecules.  Dr. Lorigan plans on
              developing new course work in the area of biophysical chemistry for both
              undergraduate and graduate students.
