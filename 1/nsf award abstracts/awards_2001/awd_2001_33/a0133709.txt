The Principal Investigator is requesting funds requested to continue
              Office of Polar Programs (OPP) support for graduate student participation in
              the annual Arctic Workshops.  Over the last eight years, OPP has supported
              attendance at this workshop through payments of registration, per diem meals,
              and lodging for four nights. The last grant supported the Arctic Workshop at
              the Universities of Ottawa,  Colorado, Washington, and Massachusetts.  The
              budget is based on an attendance of 25 students, but the actual number per
              workshop was closer to 50.  The next three workshops will be held at the
              University of Colorado, the University of Tromso (Norway), and the University
              of Colorado.  The composition of the Arctic Workshops typically consists of
              about 55% professional Arctic scientists (academic and government), and 45%
              graduate students.  A major effort is placed toward providing all the graduates
              with a forum for their research and to establish the appropriate "network" with
              their peers. The Arctic Workshops have participants from several countries with
              significant attendance from the United States, Canada, Norway, Iceland, Sweden,
              Germany/Austria, and the United Kingdom.
