CAREER: Delphin: Functional Programming in Logical
              Frameworks
Carsten Schuermann

Data structures such as lists, trees, graphs,
              arrays along with
operations on them are one of the most studied concepts in
              computer
science and supported by most modern programming languages. 
              Theorems,
proofs, and derivations on the other hand have elegant
              representations
in expressive logical frameworks but lead in general to
              complicated,
convoluted, and ultimately unreliable encodings even in
              modern
programming languages.

The proposed Delphin project engages in
              fundamental research on how to
bring together the computational features of
              programming languages
with the representational features of logical
              frameworks.  In Delphin
programmers can write automated theorem provers,
              interpreters, and
compilers with elegant and compact data objects representing
              typing
derivations (for compilers), proofs (for proof carrying code),
              and
computation traces (for abstract machines).  The proposed project
employs
              techniques from higher-order theories, dependent types,
meta-logical
              frameworks, and functional programming languages.

Delphin will shed some
              light on the epistemological tension between
abstract concepts and their
              representations; and it will provide
answers concerning their manipulation. 
              Moreover, it will open up new
research areas of how to incorporate logical
              framework technology into
other mainstream programming languages such as Java
              and C#.
