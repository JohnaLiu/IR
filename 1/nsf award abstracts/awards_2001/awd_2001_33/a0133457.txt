Abstract    :
              To achieve the best performance on modern computers, one must
understand and
              exploit the interactions between program behavior,
run-time systems, and
              hardware.  This research explores compiler and
run-time system support for
              improving load-value prediction and for
reducing the energy consumption of
              programs. Load-value prediction
exposes instruction-level parallelism in
              programs by allowing loads to
execute in parallel with the instructions that
              depend on it.  Energy
reduction techniques reduce the energy requirements of
              programs
without significantly degrading performance.

Broadly speaking this
              research considers two kinds of techniques: (i)
Compiler techniques that use
              easily-available information in programs
(such as type information) to
              transform or annotate code to make
better use of hardware; (ii) Run-time
              system techniques that
reorganize and annotate data to make better use of
              hardware.  This
research will also consider new hardware mechanisms for
              load-value
prediction and energy consumption that can be exploited in
              software.
