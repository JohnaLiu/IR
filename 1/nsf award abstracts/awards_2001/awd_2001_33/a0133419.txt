Abstract    :
              This career development plan includes significant research and educational
              components. The goal of the research program is to conduct an extensive
              analysis of U.S. manufacturers in order to assess the effects of inter-group
              cooperation, competition, and conflict on firm agility. Improving the social
              dimensions of organizations is increasingly important where competitors have
              access to comparable technology.  The research design includes both qualitative
              and quantitative methods. The educational program will provide research
              opportunities for undergraduate students, with an emphasis on attracting and
              retaining women and under-represented minorities to industrial engineering. The
              program includes training students in data collection and analysis methods and
              involving the students in all aspects of research.
