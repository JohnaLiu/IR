Abstract    :
              
   Interconnect has always been the dominant component consuming area, delay,
              and energy in Field-Programmable Gate Arrays and related spatial computing
              devices. With interconnect requirements scaling faster than linearly in device
              gate capacity and fundamental interconnect delays in VLSI scaling slower than
              gate speeds, this problem is only exacerbated as we go forward.  Further, with
              the size of silicon systems we can build today, all kinds of single-chip
              architectures (e.g. multiprocessor, system-on-a-chip, VLIW, Vector, PIM) will
              be moving toward greater on-chip parallelism and hence greater use of on-chip,
              programmable interconnect.

Nonetheless, interconnect is probably the least
              understood component in programmable devices.  The fundamental goal of this
              research is to close gaps in our understanding of interconnect structures and
              in our quantification of interconnect requirements and synthesize this
              understanding into an            engineering-grade approach to programmable
              interconnect design.  This effort will build upon results in VLSI and Parallel
              theory, but goes beyond them to close asymptotic gaps, understand how to
              optimize the constant factors, and characterize the properties and behavior of
              typical designs. 

The pedagogical goal is to make the design space, issues,
              tradeoffs, and impact of spatial interconnect design accessible to students and
              practitioners with an undergraduate computer science background.
