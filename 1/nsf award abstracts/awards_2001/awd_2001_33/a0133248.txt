Abstract    :
              Computer security is an especially pressing and national need because of the
              increasing dependence on information systems in most aspects of our lives
              including business, finance, transportation, medicine, education and national
              security to name a few. These information technology systems are vulnerable to
              a variety of events which can compromise the functioning and integrity of the
              system such as design problems, physical failures, malicious attacks, and
              scaling problems that can occur within individual components and systems and in
              the complex interaction among these systems. While there is ongoing research in
              security such as in computer systems, networks, storage, cryptography, and
              distributed systems, more needs to be done, especially to ensure availability,
              fault-tolerance, confidentiality, and the integrity of the information system
              from applications to underlying infrastructure.  

A workshop on security,
              privacy, and trust was held in the fall of 2001 in Berkeley, CA.  The purpose
              of the workshop was to bring together academic, industrial, and government
              experts in these areas to develop a research agenda and identify research areas
              that can make a major impact in the future.  The workshop provided a report
              outlining a research agenda for trustworthiness and information security on the
              national scale.
