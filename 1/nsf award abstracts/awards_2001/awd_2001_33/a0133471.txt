Abstract    :
              The theoretical and experimental research efforts in this project focus on
              haptics interaction and  visual servoing of deformable objects through shared
              control. In particular, novel haptics modeling of interaction with deformable
              objects  will be explored, using  overlaying  local  nonlinear modeling of
              elasto-dynamic properties of objects; new visual servoing algorithms will be
              formulated for tracking deformable objects using position and image based
              control techniques; new robot control algorithms will be developed for safe
              interaction with a pacient's organs using  haptics and vision. The project's
              education component focuses on developing new courses, involving students in
              course development, and involving undergraduate students in research.  The PI
              will also participate in education of the under-represented high  school
              students.
