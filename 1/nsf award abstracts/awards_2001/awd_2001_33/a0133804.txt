Under this CAREER Award, a new set of computer-assisted analysis
              techniques will be developed to improve the noninvasive diagnosis of brain
              cancer by integrating biochemical and morphological markers from MRSI (magnetic
              resonance spectroscopy imaging) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).  MRSI,
              which allows for characterization and quantification of biochemical metabolites
              and the construction of metabolite intensity images, combined with MRI provides
              a biochemical and morphological view of the disease.  Using short MRSI echo
              time techniques, 10-20 dimensional multi-variant feature space will be studied
              to uncover specific signatures for characterizing cancer.  Specific aims
              include:  develop "semi-blind" source separation using a maximum a posteriori
              framework for recovery of metabolite intensity images in MRSI; characterize the
              correlations and dependencies between metabolite intensity images and
              morphological information derived from MRI; develop a hierarchical
              probabilistic model for integrating metabolite intensity images with MRI for
              the joint biochemical/morphological characterization of brain tumors; and
              assess the performance of the models within the context of computer-assisted
              diagnosis, making comparisons to traditional methods that have relied on fairly
              elementary relationships, such as the ratio of two metabolite
              concentrations.

The educational component of the proposal focuses on a
              program in machine learning for biomedical engineering, including a new course
              and computer laboratories and efforts that would serve as a basis of an
              industrial internship program.  The course will introduce students to the
              mathematical theory behind machine learning and probabilistic models, their
              application to the biomedical sciences, and techniques for evaluating and
              validating their performance.
