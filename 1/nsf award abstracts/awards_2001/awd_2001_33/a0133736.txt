This research is centered around
              problems of segmentation in image processing.  Segmentation, which may be
              described as the problem of locating meaningful regions within an image, is a
              crucial problem in medical imaging, military imaging, and a variety of other
              image based applications. The two goals of this research are to (1) advance the
              state of the art in image segmentation and (2) develop frameworks to solve
              segmentation jointly with other image processing problems.  A key an example of
              (2) will focus around the problem of image registration (aligning common
              objects seen within two or more images).  Tradiditionally, the problems of
              segmentation (locating the objects in each image) and registration (lining them
              up) are solved separately.
This research explores methods for solving such
              problems simultaneously, with the important benefit that one of the problems
              need not be fully solved before starting the solution of the other problem. The
              Principal Investigator's approach to problems (1) and (2) will draw strongly
              from the mathematical theories of differential geometry, curve and surface
              evolution, the calculus of variations, and partial differential equations
              (PDE's).  PDE's comprise very natural and powerful mathematical tools due to
              their flexibility, ease of implementation, and mathematical rigor. Their
              current and previous applications to problems in image processing (including
              segmentation) have demonstrated their strong potential in this field.

Under
              the recommended level of support, the PI will make every attempt to meet the
              original scope and level of effort of this project.
