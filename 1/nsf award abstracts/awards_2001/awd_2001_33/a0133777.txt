Abstract    :
              	The gap between microprocessor and memory system cycle times has been
              increasing over the past 15 years. In practice, because of the many levels in
              the memory hierarchy and interconnection busses between the processor and DRAM,
              a primary memory access may take 200 processor clock cycles from request to
              response; more than 50% of this latency is due to the memory hierarchy and
              interconnect. This research will focus upon the reduction of this fraction by
              novel interconnect techniques and increased
focus on the DRAM controller
              management policies. As the amount of state present in DRAM devices increases,
              the available set of memory controller policy decisions also increases; this
              increased flexibility allows an intelligent memory controller to optimize
              controller policies to achieve
increased performance. This research will
              examine the potential for improved performance when the memory controller
              changes from a static control policy to a dynamic control scheme. This impact
              will be simulated over a variety of interconnection topologies from the current
              NorthBridge to a CMP architecture with multiple DRAM busses.
