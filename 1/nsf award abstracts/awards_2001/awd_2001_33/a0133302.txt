Abstract    :
              
Increasingly, confidential information is placed on
              network-accessible
computers by organizations and individuals, yet neither the
              current
practice nor theories of computer security are adequate to ensure
              that
this information remains confidential. The lack of sound mechanisms
for
              protecting confidential information, especially in the presence of
malicious
              code or hosts, creates serious privacy, liability, and even
national security
              concerns.

This research explores new security mechanisms that provide
              stronger,
end-to-end assurance that data remains confidential.  The focus is
              on
three important areas where existing models are inadequate and
              existing
enforcement methods are impractical.  First, confidentiality must
be
              protected even in systems that include both mutually distrusting
principals
              and untrusted, possibly malicious hosts. Second, concurrent
and distributed
              systems create new challenges for information flow
control.  Third, new
              techniques are needed for verifying that binary
code, including legacy code,
              protects confidential information.

The goal of this work is fast, practical,
              end-to-end assurance of
confidentiality for decentralized systems with mutual
              distrust. This
kind of assurance promises to significantly strengthen the
              security of
the emerging computing infrastructure.
