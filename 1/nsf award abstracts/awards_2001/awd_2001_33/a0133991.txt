Emmet James Whitehead

Twenty-five years of research and
              development on Configuration Management
(CM) systems has bequeathed a rich
              legacy of data models, system
architectures, and implementation approaches.
              This existing knowledge about
CM systems is analyzed to distill out the key
              lessons, and then leveraged
for advanced research on CM. The research advances
              the maturity of CM
knowledge by performing a comprehensive domain analysis of
              CM systems, and
by developing specification languages and technology to permit
              automatic
generation of CM repositories.

A domain model permits the
              characterization of an existing CM system as a
point in a multidimensional
              design tradeoff space. This research describes
key design spaces in sufficient
              detail to permit the specification of a
single point in design tradeoff space.
              This specification can be fed to a
generator that automatically generates a
              matching CM system. Research
challenges include the creation of a repository
              specification language; a
language for creating detailed CM system
              specifications that identify
specific design choices, and resolve design
              tradeoffs; and the development
of generator technology that automatically
              creates source code to implement
a given repository specification. This
              auto-generation technology provides a
valuable tool for exploring advanced
              data models for CM systems.
