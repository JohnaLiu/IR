Kathryn Johnston

Dr. Johnston is awarded
              funds to establish a research program in the structure, formation, and
              evolution of galaxies at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. Her
              approach focuses on using low-surface-brightness features of galaxies as
              tracers of the gravitational potential. The work will use gravitational N-body
              simulations to test and understand analytical and semi-analytical models of the
              formation of these low-surface-brightness features, and develop new methods of
              interpreting observations. Dr. Johnston's theoretical research group will
              collaborate with observational groups to carry out the interpretations. The
              group will also collaborate with cosmologists to place the results on
              individual galaxies in the broader context of galaxy formation in general. 
              

Aspects of the research program will be integrated into the educational
              mission of Wesleyan University by developing web-based tutorials for beginning
              research students.  These tutorials will subsequently be used as a basis for a
              course in computational astrophysics that fits naturally into a
              cross-disciplinary certificate program in computational science currently under
              development at the university.
