Abstract    :
              This proposal aims to advance the state of the art of automated strategic
              reasoning through research and teaching at the intersection of computer science
              and economics.  In research, the development of a computational theory of
              social choice is proposed, emphasizing the interplay of artificially
              intelligent agent strategies and computational mechanisms that implement
              collective decisions.  Such a theory will facilitate the translation of
              collective decision-making by human societies into digital form.  In education,
              the design of courses and degree programs across computer science and economics
              is proposed, as is encouraging women to participate in such programs and to
              explore careers that build on the resulting cross-disciplinary skill
              sets.
