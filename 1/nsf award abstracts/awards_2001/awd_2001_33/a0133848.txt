Abstract    :
              This project will investigate how information technology is transforming
              financial markets and stock exchanges, which have historically introduced
              technological innovations that are later deployed in other markets, with the
              goal of understanding how other markets will be impacted by electronic trading
              systems. This research will identify ways to improve current systems, enhance
              the design of future systems, understand when electronic trading systems are
              valuable, and anticipate the adoption of future technologies. Using both public
              and proprietary data from the world's largest electronic market, Nasdaq, this
              program will use a variety of econometric techniques to explore how electronic
              trading systems impact stock markets both during and outside of the traditional
              trading day. The insights into the development of electronic markets and
              technological innovations in trade will be incorporated in MBA and
              undergraduate classes to improve understanding of the real-world tradeoffs
              between different market structures and the organization of an integrated firm
              versus coordination though markets and in a Ph.D. seminar to study features
              critical to electronic markets' success and technology adoption and diffusion
              across electronic markets. This program is the beginning of a research agenda
              focused on related questions in other electronic markets and ways that
              information technology transforms commerce.
