Abstract    :
              Home Area Networks (HANs) are an emerging technology that is very likely to play
              a major role in future homes. Broad deployment of this technology, however,
              depends strongly on the achieved security and the policies used to allow
              unsophistcated users to express and communicate their security requirements.
              The  key  objective of this research is to investigate technologies and
              methodologies which can be deployed and used to protect home networks.  The 
              research  contributions  include  (a) user-accessible security policies, (b) a
              framework for  the  safe and  secure  communication between devices in a Home
              Automation Network (HAN), and (c)  the collection and  analysis  of empirical
              findings by deploying such devices in a home environment.  Without the security
              components that this research will  produce,  wide deployment of HANs may have
              devastating consequences. The results of low security awareness  coupled with 
              "always-on" connectivity have been demonstrated by the problems caused  by 
              computer  viruses.   In  addition,  the proxy-based communication framework
              that will be implemented as part of this research, will also be applicable  to 
              self-reconfigurable networks that may be found in health monitoring systems,
              battlefield sensor networks, etc.
