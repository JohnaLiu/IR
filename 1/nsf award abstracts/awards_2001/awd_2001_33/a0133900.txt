Abstract    :
              
This project will study the role that video can play in how teachers learn and
              how they develop a professional vision of their craft.  The use of video based
              lessons of various sorts has become popular in the professional development of
              teachers.  Meanwhile, research has sought to focus on the notion of a
              "professional vision" for teaching as researchers work to refine our
              understanding of how good teachers optimize their blend of pedagogical and
              content knowledge in the context of specific instructional tasks.  This project
              will examine the use of video in the context of teacher professional vision. 
              It will develop, apply, and refine a new organizing and analytic framework for
              studying this phenomenon, and will include the analysis of video content,
              professional development program design, interviews with teachers, and
              observations of video clubs. The research will be the source of several new and
              revised courses on learning sciences, teaching and pedagogy, mathematics
              teaching methods, and alternative certification.
