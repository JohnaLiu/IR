Abstract    :
              This project integrates ecological research with university graduate and
              undergraduate instruction to assess how inputs of atmospheric nitrogen (N) from
              fossil fuel emission alter the carbon (C) cycling of southern Californian
              semi-arid shrublands.  Atmospheric N fertilization has been implicated in the
              decline of northern forests.  However, the effects of atmospheric N
              fertilization on western shrublands have not been adequately quantified even
              though these ecosystems are exposed to some of the highest atmospheric N
              pollution levels in the world.  This project will employ field observational
              and manipulative studies to assess changes in ecosystem structure and function
              to atmospheric N fertilization and provide a mechanistic understanding of the
              ecosystem response.  In turn, the field studies will significantly enhance
              lecture and laboratory curricula in terrestrial ecology and provide students an
              opportunity to actively investigate the impact of human activities on the C
              cycling of ecosystems that are regionally important.
