Abstract    :
              Summary:  This research requests funding for an exploratory field effort to
              confirm the existence of and date the extent of laminated sediments in
              Norwegian fjords.   Multicorer samples will be taken in seven selected fjords. 
              Radiometric dating and assessment of benthic foraminifer faunas in recovered
              sediments will be done to determine suitability of the material  for detailed
              paleoclimate studies.
