Abstract    :
              This research will develop techniques to provide seamless and transparent access
              to databases on the deep web. In particular, the project will build a metaquery
              system that helps users to find and query the databases. The specific tasks
              will include source discovery and modeling, semi-structured unified schema
              construction, dynamic source selection, metaquery language definition, and
              metaquerier system development. The career development plan will include
              modernizing the database curriculum as well as promoting interdisciplinary
              research.
