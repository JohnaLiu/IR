Abstract    :
              The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this Career
              award to Washington University.  With this award, Professor Thomas Vaid will
              systematically study controlled doping of organic hydrocarbons using
              isostructural n- and p-dopants. Dopants will be synthesized and characterized
              for electrical charge transport behavior in solid state and electrochemical
              properties in solution.  Doped crystals will be grown by a number of methods
              including vapor sublimation, melt crystallization and solution-phase
              crystallization. Junctions will be formed between doped semiconductors by vapor
              deposition or alloy junction growth to study current rectification behavior and
              photovoltaic responses.  Organic light emitting diodes and organic field effect
              transistors are potential devices to be expected from these doped organic
              semiconducting crystals. The proposed educational program includes introduction
              of materials chemistry courses and laboratory experiments with special emphasis
              on acquisition and analysis of physical data on molecules and materials
              synthesized by students.  Research training provided by the program will
              prepare graduate and undergraduate students for advanced studies and
              research

New organic semiconducting crystal will be synthesized from
              hydrocarbons using isostructural doping using newly synthesized n- and
              p-dopants. Educational programs in materials chemistry will prepare students
              for advanced studies and research in electrooptic and conjugated materials.
