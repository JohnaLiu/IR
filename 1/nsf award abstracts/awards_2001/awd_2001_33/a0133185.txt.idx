NSF Program : 7261      PROGRAM EVALUATION

Abstract    :
              The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Directorate
              for Education and Human resources proposes to develop program evaluation
              models and tools that will be used to collectively and individually assess
              the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Alliance for Graduate Education and
              the Professoriate (AGEP) Program.  Under the AGEP Program, NSF supports a
              portfolio of projects that serve as effective models for addressing issues
              related to increasing the number of minority students pursuing advanced
              degrees; obtaining doctoral degrees; and entering the professoriate in
              science, mathematics, engineering, and technology
              (SMET) disciplines.  Products will include the AGEP Evaluation Framework;
              evaluation models; and evaluation tools and protocols. Dissemination of
              evaluation information and materials will be done in print and web site
              format. In addition, AAAS will host 3 AGEP evaluation workshops to help
              Alliance members understand how to use the AGEP Evaluation Framework, models,
              and tools.
