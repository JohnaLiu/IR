Abstract    :
              Theoretical calculations of coalescing compact binaries (mergers of two neutron
              stars or a neutron star and a black hole) will be performed using 3-D
              hydrodynamic techniques on parallel supercomputers.  These calculations will
              include, for the first time ever, a complete treatment of all lowest-order
              post-Newtonian effects (i.e., the most important corrections to Newtonian
              gravity imposed by Einstein's general theory of relativity). In particular, the
              dissipative effects due to the emission of gravitational waves will be included
              in the hydrodynamics.  These calculations will provide us with a much more
              accurate description of the binary coalescence process, including more accurate
              theoretical predictions for the gravitational radiation signals that may soon
              become detectable by laser interferometer detectors such as LIGO.  They will
              also help us understand the mechanisms that may be important for producing the
              most powerful gamma-ray bursts observed by astronomers throughout the visible
              Universe.
