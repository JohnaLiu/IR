The PI proposes to study three problems related to the generic
              phenomenon of a body falling in a fluid, a problem first considered by Maxwell
              in 1853.  More specifically the first one is to develop a mathematical model
              for the vorticity being shed from a falling plate.  Two-dimensional flow will
              be considered in this analytical study.   The second one involves the extension
              of the first problem to a falling flexible plate.   In this case, the shape of
              the flexible body is given as a function of time and it is incorporated in the
              solution of the problem.  The third problem considers the falling body through
              a stratified fluid, experimental investigation will be made as well as analysis
              with linear modeling.  Numerical simulations of the problem will be made in
              collaboration with a colleague at San Diego State University.  Broader impacts
              of this research, when extended to three dimensions will include aerospace
              applications and propagation of seedpods. The education plan is quite novel,
              the PI plans to use sports to teach science and engineering to undergraduates
              and high school students.  The high school students will be those enrolled in
              the Preuss School at UCSD, which is chartered under the San Diego Unified
              School District offering intensive college preparatory education program for
              low-income students.
