Abstract    :
              This proposal describes a symbiosis of research and education which blends
              mechanics and control in a way that advances the state and applicability of
              nonlinear control theory while offering unique opportunities to educate
              engineers by appealing to their earliest fascinations.  The research integrates
              recently developed energy methods for controlling mechanical systems with
              empirical models of viscous fluid forces in order to control ocean and
              atmospheric vehicles using internal actuators.  Educational activities
              complement this research and cultivate excitement for learning and discovery
              among students, and prospective students, through real-world engineering
              challenges involving vehicle dynamics and control and creative design.  The
              research adapts energy-shaping control strategies to stabilize and maneuver
              vehicles using internal rotors or moving masses, focusing on the "case study"
              of an underwater vehicle.  By incorporating viscous effects into the control
              design process, one may use them to advantage through clever modulation of a
              vehicle's internal shape.  Research objectives include characterizing the
              effect of non-conservative forces on systems controlled using energy-shaping
              feedback, developing control strategies for internally actuated vehicles which
              exploit viscous effects, extending these strategies to vehicles with
              conventional actuators, and evaluating controller performance with an
              experimental underwater vehicle.  Internal actuators promise to significantly
              enhance the efficiency, reliability, and performance envelope of underwater
              vehicles, moving them closer toward their inevitable role as workhorses for
              ocean science, offshore industry, and the military.  Other areas where the
              resulting theory could be applied include internally or conventionally actuated
              ocean surface vessels, lighter-than-air vehicles, aircraft, low-orbit or
              re-entering spacecraft, and more general mechanical systems.
