Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop a methodology for analyzing the wealth of
              information captured by imaging sensors that densely sample visible light.
              Methods will be developed for automated selection of an "ideal" set of filters
              for multi-spectral imaging. Algorithms will be explored for accurate
              interpretation and recreation of scenes with complex light interaction, in
              particular in the high-dimensional spectral domain. Techniques for extraction
              of geometric and photometric invariants from video images will be studied, and
              novel algorithms will be generated for visualization of "invisible" spectral
              information. The project's education component includes development of new
              cross-disciplinary undergraduate and graduate courses, appropriate modification
              of existing courses, and hands-on approach to coursework and research projects.
