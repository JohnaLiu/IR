Abstract    :
              T. Daniel Crawford is supported by a CAREER grant from the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to develop and apply accurate quantum chemical
              methods to the chiroptical properties of large molecules.  He will design
              practical computational tools for the determination of the absolute
              configurations for newly synthesized chrial molecules and for insight into
              optical activity.  He will also develop new algorithms to overcome the
              polynomial scaling of coupled cluster theory.  In his educational activities,
              he will develop an integrated computational chemistry program across the
              undergraduate chemistry curriculum, involving computational experiments for the
              lab courses.

Optical properties of large chiral molecules are of interest to
              natural product research in order to manipulate and synthesize stereochemically
              pure chiral drugs.  The ultimate goal of this research program is to develop a
              computationally efficient and accuate method for calculating these properties
              from first princilpes.  The goals of this educational program are not only to
              teach students the fundamentals of computational chemistry and for what
              chemical problems computational techniques may be the preferred analytical
              tool, but also to help them understand why and when such tools might fail.  The
              lab projects will be collected into a computational chemistry handbook to be
              published in print and on the web for use by other chemistry departments.
