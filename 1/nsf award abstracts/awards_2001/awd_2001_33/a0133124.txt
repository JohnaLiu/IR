Abstract    :
              This research project will develop adaptive, personalized, topic-driven crawlers
              to help search engines. The current search engines do not scale in a dynamic
              environment. The proposed research will overcome this limitation. The research
              will utilize an autonomous agent-based approach to building new scalable
              algorithms. The career development plan will include integrating the results
              into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum. The students will also carry
              out projects using the results of this research.
