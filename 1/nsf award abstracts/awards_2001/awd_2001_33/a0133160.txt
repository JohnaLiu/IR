              ABSTRACT

OCE-0133160

A PI from Georgia Institute of Technology will use
              MRPG funds to study the distribution, transport and behavior of 37Cs in the
              Savannah Estuary.  The goal of this project is to ascertain whether sediments
              in estuaries are a permanent sink for naturally-occurring and anthropogenic
              radionuclides.  About 20 sediment cores will be collected in this estuary along
              with some samples from nearby riverine and marine environments to obtain
              "endpoints".  Samples will be analyzed for 37Cs, major cations, trace metals,
              mineralogy and grain size.  The PI also will analyze her samples for 210Pb,
              226Ra, 234Th and 7Be to identify the dominant physical transport processes
              affecting sediments in the Savannah Estuary.
