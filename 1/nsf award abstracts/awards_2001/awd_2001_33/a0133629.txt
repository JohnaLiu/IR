Abstract    :
              Intrusion detection is a critical component of the defense-in-depth
network
              security mechanisms. Current intrusion detection systems
(IDSs) are
              ineffective against new and sophisticated attacks.

The key objective of this
              research project is to develop the
algorithms, tools, and system architecture
              for adaptive IDSs. An
adaptive IDS needs to detect new attacks and adjust to
              changes in
normal operations. Towards this end, an information-theoretic
              based
anomaly detection framework is investigated. The approach is to
              first
compute the regularity of normal data using
              information-theoretic
measures, then select features and construct a detection
              model
according to the regularity measures. An adaptive IDS needs to
              also
self-monitor its run-time workload and performance, and
              dynamically
reconfigure its components to provide the best detection
              capability
given the limited resources. Towards this end, performance
              monitoring,
load-shedding, attack scenario analysis, and cost-benefit
              analysis
techniques are investigated.

Through the publications and
              algorithms and tools from this research,
researchers and practitioners can
              learn the benefits and techniques of
adaptive IDSs. This research also makes
              important contributions to
related fields, e.g., survivable network systems
              and smart
auditing. Ultimately, the society will benefit from the more
              effective
and robust security mechanisms.
