Abstract    :
              This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs (OPP) of the National
              Science Foundation (NSF), provides support for a workshop designed to initiate
              discussion about future scientific objectives and technical needs of the
              Antarctic marine geology and geophysics community. It has been about a decade
              since the community last took a focused look at the long-range science goals
              and needs for Antarctic marine geology and so a new perspective is needed. The
              present need for such a dialogue is also based on the timing of the lease
              schedule for the current ship support to the US Antarctic Research Program.
              Although ship support for Antarctic science is contracted for several more
              years, the process of developing scientific requirements as planning input for
              ship support beyond this period takes a considerable amount of time and so must
              begin soon. Consequently, within the next year, a document outlining the
              anticipated future scientific goals and objectives, in a broad fashion, and
              describing the specific technical needs for marine geologic and geophysical
              work in the Southern Ocean must be available for proper planning. The report
              produced from this workshop will serve as this planning document and will be
              available as a hard copy and on the Internet. The workshop will be held during
              Spring of 2002, in Washington, D.C. The meeting will be advertised via e-mail
              and through EOS, so that all interested individuals will have the opportunity
              to attend.
