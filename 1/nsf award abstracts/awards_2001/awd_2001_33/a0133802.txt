Abstract    :
              This research project will advance intelligent search engines by developing
              query-concept learners. Techniques for detecting concept drifts as well as
              multi-resolution image characterization will be developed. In particular the
              research will be based on two online algorithms, MEGA and SVMActive. It will
              also integrated text attributes in image searching and apply the technology to
              video data. The career development plan will include sponsoring undergraduate
              and graduate projects as well as incorporating the research into the Computer
              Science curriculum.
