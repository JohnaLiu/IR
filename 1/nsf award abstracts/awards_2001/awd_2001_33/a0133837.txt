It is proposed
              to perform large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent jets in cross-flow using
              unstructured grids.  The problem is chosen because its applicability to a
              number of important technical problems such as fuel injectors, V/STOL aircraft,
              film cooling of turbine blades and etc.  Furthermore such a flow cannot be
              correctly predicted by the current computational scheme of Reynolds-averaged
              Navier-Stokes equations (RANS).  Unstructured grids are chosen to allow mesh
              points to be localized near the jet boundary and near the wall.  The method of
              computation will be based on a kinetic energy conserving scheme, which was
              developed by the PI.  The results will be compared to existing experimental
              data.  The LES scheme, once fully developed, will be applied to a range of
              other flows. The education plan involves development of new graduate courses,
              incorporate research component into both graduate and undergraduate courses,
              and including undergraduate students in research projects.
