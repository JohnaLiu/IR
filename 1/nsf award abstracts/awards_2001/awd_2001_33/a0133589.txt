CAREER:  An In-Kernel Runtime
              Execution Environment for User-Level Programs

We propose to develop a system
              that will simplify operating system code development while improving
              performance.  Developing operating system kernel code is difficult for three
              reasons.  First, the kernel is an unforgiving environment to work in, where any
              small bug can result in large-scale data corruption; debugging tools for
              kernels are not as flexible as their user-level counterparts and are not used
              often.  Second, kernel developers must write codes that takes into account many
              unusual conditions such as resource contention, locks, reference counts, being
              interrupted or re-entrant, and more.  Third, before programmers can become
              proficient kernel developers, they must read and understand large amounts of
              complex kernel code. However, one major advantage to developing kernel code is
              that it runs very fast; the kernel has direct access to all the system
              resources.

The benefits of this research will include the creation of a
              novel system that allows anyone who can write user-level code to develop and
              test their code in the user level where it is easier to do so, and then to
              execute that code inside the kernel to gain significant performance benefits. 
              This research will enable us to learn about the security and scalability of
              running many kernel applications and develop methods to optimize the
              performance of in-kernel applications further.
