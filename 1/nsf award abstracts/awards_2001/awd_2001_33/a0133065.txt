Raven 
Invasive plants are a major economic problem and are a serious
              threat to the protection of biodiversity in natural areas. Efforts to reduce
              the number of invaders must focus not only on controlling existing species but
              also on identifying pathways of introduction to reduce establishment. Many of
              these non-native species were introduced accidentally, but the majority were
              introduced for horticultural use. Introductions for horticulture use continue
              at a high rate, and species already here that demonstrate invasive ability are
              rarely removed from use. The workshop will bring together government, private,
              and academic interests in ecology and horticulture to address several relevant
              issues. The invited participants will: 1) develop specific codes of conduct for
              interest areas within horticulture, including nurseries, botanical gardens,
              landscape architects, and the gardening public; 2) assess and refine explicit
              easy-to-use methods and guidelines for evaluating plant species for potential
              to become invasive pests; and 3) develop and assess methods to determine
              acceptable alternatives to many invasive species currently used in the United
              States for horticulture. It is intended that the discussions will search for
              concrete solutions acceptable to all parties and that, from the discussions,
              research and action agendas will be identified. The results of the workshop
              will be presented to the commercial horticulture and botanical garden
              communities, as well as to the Weed Science Society of America, for discussion,
              refinement and adoption.
