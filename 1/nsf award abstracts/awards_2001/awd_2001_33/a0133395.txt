Abstract    :
              This is a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award.  Computer access by
              means of augmentative and alternative communication can be an extremely
              valuable assistive technology for the disabled.  This project seeks to improve
              its efficiency and to develop accurate models of  the performance of
              individuals with disabilities when using computer access.  As an educational
              tool, an accurate modeling method would provide clinicians with insight into
              how specific disabilities affect an individual's ability to operate different
              kinds of devices.  As an assessment tool, an accurate model would allow a
              clinician to identify potential devices and device configurations that are most
              likely to be successful for a particular client.  The modeling technique will
              be used in a theoretical and empirical study to determine the most efficient
              method for representing language within an augmentative and alternative
              communication device.  A software tool will also be developed that allows
              clinicians to incorporate the user modeling technique into their existing
              clinical processes.

This CAREER award recognizes and supports the early
              career-development activities of a teacher-scholar who is likely to become an
              academic leader of the twenty-first century.  The research project will develop
              science and technology needed to maximize the benefit of computers for disabled
              people, thereby allowing them to lead more productive and fulfilling lives. 
              The educational component will give graduate and undergraduate students the
              opportunity to become involved in both fundamental research and clinical
              application in the areas of human-machine interfaces and assistive technology
              for the disabled.
