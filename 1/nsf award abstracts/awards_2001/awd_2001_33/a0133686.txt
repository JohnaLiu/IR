Abstract    :
              This research project will develop techniques to make database systems
              cache-resident. The approach will develop three classes of techniques and they
              are (i) static data placement for deep memory hierarchies, (ii) cache buffer
              management and (iii) addressing coherence overload on multiprocessor systems.
              The research will also develop optimization techniques and investigate data
              layout alternatives. The career development plan will bridge database systems
              and computer architecture education programs and also promote interactions
              between computer architecture and database systems students and researchers.
