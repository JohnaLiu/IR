Abstract    :
              This award will be used to compile and analyze a series of annually dated ice
              core records and to produce a unique data set capable of yielding sub-annual
              snow accumulation records from Greenland.  The data set will include
              multi-century and multi-decadal records from a variety of sites in Greenland as
              well as records from Danish archives and other historical coring
              efforts.

Following database development, the researchers will employ
              multiple statistical and time series analyses techniques to investigate spatial
              and temporal relationships in the long-term variability of annual (and
              subannual) accumulation from individual sites across the Greenland Ice Sheet.
