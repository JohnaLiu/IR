Abstract    :
              This research project will develop techniques and systems that answer the
              following question, independent of content type: "What items have the highest
              probability of being both interesting and relevant to my information need?"
              Whether or not an item (document, resource, etc) is "interesting" for a given
              information need will depend on the user's background and taste. Book and web
              page recommenders will be built and evaluated that predict relevance and
              interest based on content and interest ratings entered by each member of a
              large Internet community. A content rating indicates how much a user believes
              that a relationship exists between an item and a content attribute while an
              interest rating specifies the user's level of interest in an item. Affinities
              between users' interests and users' perception of content relationships will be
              leveraged to transfer recommendations implicitly between users. The career
              development plan involves a) the development of a graduate focus in
              "Intelligent Information Systems," which allies approaches from artificial
              intelligence, information retrieval, and human computer interaction against
              problems of information overload, and b) development of a summer REU program
              with the goal of increasing the number of broadly educated US Citizens
              (particularly women) in Ph.D. computing graduate programs.
