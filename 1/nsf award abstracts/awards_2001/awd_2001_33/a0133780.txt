This proposal lies at the
              frontier in an area, self-assembly in dense suspensions, in which theory lags
              behind rapidly evolving experimental techniques.  The focus on
              geometrically-based statistical mechanics and novel simulations to address
              entropy-driven processes promises research at a high intellectual level. 
              

The theory has a clear physical basis and is relatively simple, but not
              easy, and is complemented by an experimental effort in collaboration with a
              group equipped to measure interparticle potentials directly. This approach
              might be powerful and simple enough to provide guidance for experimentalists
              seeking to self-assemble novel structures and to appeal to others applying
              statistical mechanics. The educational effort wisely concentrates on the
              undergraduate curriculum for chemical engineering, particularly the
              thermodynamic content. There is much to gain from linking course content to
              physically accessible topics in graduate research.
