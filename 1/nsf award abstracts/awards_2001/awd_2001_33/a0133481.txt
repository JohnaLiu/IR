Abstract    :
              The research project will develop a distributed data management system for
              managing sensor data. Specifically it will develop an infrastructure for a
              sensor data management system as well as techniques for processing queries over
              data streams. It will also develop data models for handling new data types
              inherent in sensor data. The techniques will be demonstrated in a working
              prototype. This prototype will be used for research and education purposes in
              sensor data management. The career development plan will include the use of
              "active learning" for teaching. In this method, teachers involve students in
              presenting material through in-class exercises, open questions, as well as
              working in three-minute in-class two or three member group projects.
