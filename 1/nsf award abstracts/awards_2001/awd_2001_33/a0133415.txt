Abstract    :
              . This research project will first develop a new scalable algorithm for
              clustering that can detect an unknown number of arbitrarily shaped clusters.
              This approach will be based on a synchronization model of plus-coupled
              oscillators. Next the project will build a CBIR (Content-Based Image Retrieval)
              prototype using the clustering algorithm developed in this research. The career
              development plan will include training students in CBIR as well as initiating a
              research seminar series. The proposed research will also support undergraduate
              design projects.
