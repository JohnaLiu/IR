CAREER: Global Self-Organization
              of all Known Proteins - Toward a Complete Map of the Protein Space

This
              effort addresses the growing need to characterize and organize all known
              proteins (the protein space) into functional classes.  This effort will develop
              sensitive algorithms to detect subtle relationships between proteins and
              protein families, and will study and develop new techniques for representing
              the protein space as a mathematical object that can be further explored. 
              Additionally, it will develop new unsupervised learning techniques for studying
              the properties and geometry of the protein space, and eventually to create a
              complete road map of the protein space.

The outcome proposed will be a
              complete, accurate map of the protein universe.  A direct benefit of the map is
              the ability to automatically classify every protein; known proteins as well as
              new proteins that will be sequenced in the future.  This map can indicate the
              possible function of newly determined sequences that cannot be deciphered by
              traditional methods, based on the relative position of the sequence in the
              space.  It can expose new relationships between distantly related protein
              families, limit the possible structural conformations of sequences and explain
              the mapping of sequences to structures, and may add insights about fundamental
              evolutionary processes.
