Abstract    :
              Abstract: 

Cell surface proteins of the L1 family of cell adhesion molecules
              are centrally involved in numerous developmental processes, especially during
              the formation of the nervous system.  They interact with a large number of
              different proteins on the outside, as well the inside of cells that express
              such molecules.  Whereas some functional properties of L1 proteins are well
              conserved in a wide range of species, from nematodes to humans, other functions
              and binding partners have been developed more recently during evolution.  The
              proposed research tries to dissect this functional complexity of L1 proteins by
              analyzing the structural and functional requirements for L1-type proteins in
              specific developmental processes.  The research plan will focus on the
              formation of the nervous system in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. 
              Mutant Drosophila embryos that do not express any L1-type proteins die and
              exhibit many subtle abnormalities in their developing nervous system and a
              number of other tissues.  In Drosophila embryos with mutations in their L1-type
              gene, several nerves are not appropriately formed and specific neuronal cells
              are unable to make the correct cellular connections with their targets. 
              Natural, as well as artificially altered and mutant L1-type proteins will be
              reintroduced into such embryos to test whether they are able to rescue specific
              neurological malformations that are caused by the absence of the endogenous
              Drosophila L1 protein.  This analysis will shed light on what molecular
              functions and interactions of L1-type proteins are required in which types of
              cells to support certain developmental processes.
