Abstract    :
              The Massachusetts General Hospital is developing a large format film that will
              take an interdisciplinary look at brain science and raise questions about the
              nature and biological basis of consciousness.  For the past two decades, the
              field of cognitive neuroscience has begun to explore and understand some of the
              most complex brain functions and, for the first time, research is pointing to
              answers to such questions as, "What makes intelligence possible?" and "What
              makes consciousness possible?"  This film will examine the basic functions of
              the brain and explore some of the cutting-edge research that is reaching into
              the realms of intelligence and consciousness.  The large format film will be
              supported by outreach components that will include an educator's guide, a
              family pamphlet, a poster and a website.   Science content for the series
              will be developed by Anne Buckingham Young, Chief of the Department of
              Neurology at the Massachusetts General Hospital; Dennis Selkow, Co-Founder and
              Co-Director of the Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and Women's
              Hospital and Professor of Neurology and Neuroscience at Harvard Medical School;
              and Gary L. Gottlieb, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.  They
              will work closely with advisors with expertise in cognitive neuroscience,
              psychology, psychiatry, philosophy and biology.  The project will be under the
              direction of JoAnna Baldwin-Mallory, Director of the Office of New Ventures at
              Partners HealthCare System.   The film will be directed and produced by Peter
              Georgi who is currently producing and directing the NSF supported large format
              film, The Human Body, with the BBC.  Front-end and formative evaluation will be
              conducted by Ralph Adler of RMC Research.  As they have developed the
              conceptualization and preliminary plans for the film, the staff has identified
              several issues that would benefit from further, more in-depth planning.  These
              activities that would be conducted during the planning stage
              include:  Convening the scientific advisors and production staff to develop
              the science content further and to design an approach for presenting
              substantive content that is appropriate for the large format film
              medium. Conducting front-end evaluation of popular understandings of and
              interest in brain science. Carrying out formative testing of preliminary
              script ideas. Investigating the potential for supplementing the already
              planned outreach materials with additional components such as a guide
              specifically designed for classroom teachers, an activity guide for students, a
              CD-ROM and short radio spots that present stories from the front lines of brain
              research. Developing a film script, print and web components. Establishing
              partnerships in research and academic communities and with science centers and
              natural history museums.
