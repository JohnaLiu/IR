Abstract    :
              Previously thought to inhabit only extreme environments, Archaea are now known
              to exist throughout the oceans. These prokaryotes can contribute over 34% of
              marine bacterioplankton biomass, thereby representing an important functional
              component of biogeochemical cycling in marine ecosystems. This Small Grant for
              Exploratory Research will investigate the relative importance of Archaea and
              Eubacteria in the Southern Ocean. Water column, sediment trap and sediment core
              samples will be analyzed to quantify archaeal and bacterial diversity and
              distribution. The presence of unique biomarkers for the lipid membranes of
              these two groups will be compared to results from molecular analyses with rRNA
              probes. The data obtained will also be used to evaluate the origin of archaeal
              signals in the benthos. Since archaeal lipids are relatively resistant to
              degradation, preservation in ancient sediments might be expected; but has not
              been observed. Instead, the concentrations of these compounds in sediments
              suggest in situ production rather than deposition from the water column. This
              project will provide important data for evaluating the relationship between
              water column and sedimentary archaeal biomarkers and for determining the origin
              of archaeal in benthic habitats. The combination of lipid biomarker analysis
              with molecular ecological probing to test these questions will establish an
              essential information base for future archaeal biomarker work in Antarctica.
