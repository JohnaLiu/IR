Abstract    :
              The broad  goal of this  proposal is to gain a deeper understanding of the adult
              human mathematical mind by  studying  its  development  in  infancy.  A major 
              goal  is  to test the hypothesis that infants rely on analog magnitude 
              representations of number similar to those used by  adults,  young children,
              and non-human animals.  Previous studies suggest that infants may rely on two
              distinct systems for representing number; an object-file system for
              representing small values and an analog magnitude mechanism for representing 
              large numerical  values.    This  hypothesis  will  be  tested  by  studying 
              the psychophysics of number discrimination over a wide range of numerical
              values, testing whether  infants  are  sensitive  to  ordinal  relations 
              between  numerosities,  and  taking  the first step to determine  whether the
              enumeration process(es) that infants use involves serial or parallel
              processing. The proposed experiments will use the time that infants look at
              various displays and the location of infants. eye movements as dependent
              measures.  The results of the proposed studies should  provide a strong
              foundation for the development of a  coherent model of the development of
              non-verbal numerical representations  and  will  contribute  to  the  principal
               investigator.s  long-term  goal  of studying both the evolution and the
              development of numerical cognition.
