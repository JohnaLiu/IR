The objective of this research is to understand the mechanisms of
              arsenic uptake, translocation, distribution and detoxification by Brake fern. 
              The efficiency of arsenic uptake by Brake fern suggests the cost-effective use
              of this plant for the remediation of arsenic contaminated soils. This research
              focuses on elemental interactions of arsenic with calcium and phosphorus, plant
              biochemical responses under arsenic stresses, speciation and characterization
              of arsenic in the plant using analytical, microscopic and spectroscopic
              techniques, and microbe-root-plant-arsenic interactions.  Arsenic
              hyperaccumulation characteristics in Brake fern growing in soils of different
              arsenic concentrations will be investigated using arsenic spiked soils. The
              impacts of P (increases arsenic availability yet competes with arsenic uptake)
              and Ca (increases plant arsenic uptake and translocation) on arsenic
              accumulation, and biochemical responses of Brake fern to elevated arsenic
              (detoxification) will be examined.  Also, the beneficial effects of mycorrhizal
              fungi for enhancing arsenic accumulation by Brake fern will be explored. This
              is a collaborative research project between the University of Florida (0132089)
              and Northwestern University (0132114).  These two awards were made pursuant to
              the Joint Program on Phytoremediation, 2001-STAR-C1 (EPA, NSF, ONR, SERDP).
