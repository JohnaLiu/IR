This research will advance the comparative method in
              anthropology through 
development and application of new methods involving
              synchronic (variation 
across societies) and diachronic (variation across
              time) change. Using 
network autocorrelation matrix analyses to control for
              "Galton's Problem" 
(the independence of adjacent societies), the project will
              develop methods 
that examine how suites of characteristics covary using
              historical and 
present-day ethnographic information; evaluate these methods
              in relation both to other synchronic methods and to newly developed approaches
              in comparative historical sociology; and apply these methods to test hypotheses
              using comparative data. The project will test a set of hypotheses 
(mainly
              focusing on marriage and bridewealth) about cross-cultural 
variability using
              the ethnographic literature (codings of 120 variables for 
35 societies) from
              East Africa over the past 100 years, and then work 
towards making
              user-friendly computer programs available on the web to 
others interested in
              similar research endeavors. This research will advance 
our knowledge of East
              African societies, will help re-establish comparative 
cross-cultural research
              as a central part of anthropology, and will  help 
link qualitative and
              quantitative research traditions.
