Abstract    :
              Daniel Nocera of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  is supported by the
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program to conduct
              research on the development of photoinduced multi-electron oxidation-reduction
              transformations. Dinuclear inorganic complexes in which the constituent metal
              centers differ by two units of oxidation state will be prepared and
              characterized. Photoinduced  reactivity of these complexes will be studied.
              Specific systems selected for study include the photochemical production of
              dihydrogen from hydrohalic acids catalyzed by a newly discovered dirhenium
              photocatalyst, and related materials to be synthesized. Stereoelectronic
              factors that account for stabilization of two-equivalent mixed-valence
              complexes by diphosphazanes will be investigated and insights thus gained will
              be applied to design and synthesis of new two-unit mixed valence
              complexes.

The main thrust of the present proposal is on extending
              scientific understanding of two-electron photochemical processes and
              two-equivalent mixed-valence complexes, rather than on development of specific
              catalyic systems. However, the work has high potential of leading to future
              useful technological applications, such as design of energy-conversion
              photocycles, and activation of C-H bonds by multielectron photoredox
              transformations.
