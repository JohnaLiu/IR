Very little is known about the organic chemical composition of
              the ultrafine particles emitted by vehicles and about the atmospheric
              processing of these particles as they age during transport in the atmosphere. 
              This is especially true for the more polar organic compounds that have been
              linked to stronger mutagenic effects.  The composition of these ultrafine
              particles, and the organic species adsorbed to the particles, has very
              important implications for particle reactivity and the resulting endpoint
              effects on environmental and human health. The Research Component focus is the
              processes that control the physical and chemical attributes of vehicle-derived
              ultrafine particles.

The Research Component will: (1) design and build a new
              sampler for size- and time-resolved collection of ultrafine particles from
              vehicles; (2) conduct "aging" experiments on vehicle-derived ultrafine
              particles to determine reaction products during exposure to UV light, ozone,
              and NOx under controlled laboratory conditions; and (3) develop new analytical
              techniques to analyze the composition of both fresh and aged ultrafine
              particles.  This research will help close the gap in understanding the
              mechanism of diesel soot toxicity and identify the conditions under which aging
              mechanisms produce significant polar organic species. The results of this
              research will allow the most complete model yet of the processes governing the
              formation of vehicle-derived PM polar organic species in the atmosphere.
