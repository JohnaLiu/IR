Abstract    :
              The project will investigate the extent to which variability of the large-scale
              atmosphere is controlled by variations at the smaller synoptic scales. The
              upscale energy flux from the synoptic waves is reckoned to be an important
              contributor in generating variations at the larger scales. It is, of course, by
              no means the only contributor since instability of the zonal flow, variations
              in tropical diabatic heating, and planetary wave-zonal flow interactions can
              also generate significant planetary-scale variability in the troposphere on the
              intraseasonal-to seasonal time scales. Modeling and prediction of this
              variability component remains challenging. Drs. Orlando and, co-PI, Dr. Tung
              (Univ. of Washington, Seattle) will conduct a dynamically oriented analysis of
              the interaction of upscale synoptic fluxes and the larger-scale tropospheric
              circulation. The focus of the project will be on characterizing the upscale
              synoptic fluxes from modeling experiments of varying complexity. The project
              will advance understanding and modeling of the tropospheric circulation
              variability on intraseasonal-to-seasonal time scales, particularly, during the
              Northern winter season.
