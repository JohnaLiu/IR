Abstract    :
              The generation of cellular asymmetry is a key event in many developmental
              processes.  One important mechanism that cells use to achieve asymmetry is
              subcellular localization of RNA.  In the case of an mRNA, localization to a
              specific site within a cell efficiently targets its protein product to that
              site.  In the Drosophila oocyte, localization of distinct mRNAs to the poles is
              an essential step in generating the anterior-posterior pattern of the future
              embryo.  This research examines components of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex
              identified previously because of its role in RNA localization: these components
              are the Exuperantia (Exu) and Ypsilon Schachtel (Yps) proteins, and oskar (osk)
              mRNA.  An important hypothesis of the project is that this RNP complex
              functions to both transport mRNAs (including osk mRNA) in the cytoplasm to
              their sites of localization in the oocyte, and to regulate the translation of
              these transported mRNAs.  This research also addresses the role played by the
              microtubule cytoskeleton in transporting localized mRNAs.  Yps is a member of
              the Y-Box family of proteins; other Y-Box proteins are known to bind RNA and
              regulate translation.  Preliminary results indicate that the yps gene expresses
              more than one transcript.  These transcripts and any alternatively encoded
              protein isoforms will be characterized, and their expression patterns
              determined.  Genetic and biochemical experiments will determine if Yps acts as
              a translational repressor of osk mRNA.  The Exu protein is a novel protein that
              plays an essential role in RNA localization, and interacts directly with Yps. 
              A domain analysis of the Exu protein will address the roles played by this
              protein in mediating mRNA localization, and the association of the complex with
              microtubules.
