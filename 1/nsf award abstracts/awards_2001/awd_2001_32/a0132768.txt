Abstract    :
              
Research and educational activities tied to biomaterials and bio-inspired
              materials are the theme of the career plan of the PI. A fundamental approach is
              followed towards design of composites of hydroxyapatite and polymers for
              development of new biomaterials for bone replacement. The new approach takes
              inspiration from biology. A molecular control of polymer-HAP interactions is
              attempted with synthetic macromolecules, mimicking the formation of
              biocomposites in nature.  Experiments will involve vibrational
              microspectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy to elucidate the molecular
              interactions between polymeric additives and mineral components under simulated
              body fluid environments. These interactions and understanding their role on
              bulk macroscopic mechanical response of the composite to loading is the focus
              of these studies. This research will attempt to understand the molecular
              mechanisms involved in formation of insitu composites and develop fundamental
              science based on this understanding to design composites with properties
              tailored for bone replacement. 
The educational activities proposed are very
              closely linked to the research. PI plans to 1.) Improve awareness of the
              biomaterials field at NDSU through a new course on biomaterials, summer
              research projects for undergraduate students and establishing a NDSU chapter of
              Materials Research Society. 2.) Stimulate interest in engineering and materials
              related research in middle school girls and 3.) Bring excitement of the
              materials and biomaterials field into middle school classrooms.
