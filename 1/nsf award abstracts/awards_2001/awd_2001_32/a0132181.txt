Abstract    :
              This award to Professor Eric Conte of the Western Kentucky University is
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry
              Division.  The overall research goal is to development new methods of
              solid-phase extraction, a method commonly used to sample water and other
              solutions for trace quantities of organic components.  Solid-phase extraction
              is key sample preparation step prior to HPLC or mass spectrometry.  In the
              proposed project, ionic surfactants bound to an ion exchange resin will be
              developed as an new solid-phase extraction material.  If successful, the system
              has the potential of reducing or eliminating the use of organic solvents now
              required for solid-phase extraction, thus making the procedure more
              environmentally friendly.  Both undergraduate and graduate students will
              participate in this research.

A critical aspect of modern chemical analysis
              is sample preparation prior to instrumental analysis. New methods of
              solid-phase extraction, especially environmentally friendly methods, will
              likely find quick application in analytical chemistry.  Undergraduate
              researchers can potentially make significant contributions in this research
              area.
