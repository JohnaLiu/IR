This grant provides partial support for the purchase of
              additional online peripheral devices as well as necessary ancillary equipment
              for the stable isotope laboratory at Dartmouth College.  The stable isotope lab
              currently houses two stable isotope mass spectrometers, a Finnigan Delta E and
              a ThermoFinnigan Delta Plus XL, and three online ThermoFinnigan peripheral
              devices, an Elemental Analyzer and a Gas Chromatograph/ Combustion system (GCC)
              and a TC/EA.  The lab also maintains a wide array of offline equipment for the
              extraction of oxygen and hydrogen from minerals, rocks and waters, and oxygen,
              hydrogen and carbon from organic matter, soils and soil gas.  Isotope
              extraction procedures currently done offline, including water analyses and
              carbonate analyses, will be done more efficiently and with no compromise to
              data quality by online and automated peripheral devices.  Specifically
              equipment to be purchased includes a ThermoFinnigan H/Device for automated
              online hydrogen isotope analysis of water samples, a ThermoFinnigan GasBench II
              system for automated online hydrogen and oxygen isotope analysis of water
              samples, carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of carbonate minerals, carbon
              isotopic analysis of dissolved inorganic carbon and online analysis of soil
              CO2, and an analytical balance.  The upgraded lab will support research by
              faculty and students in three departments (Earth Sciences, Environmental
              Studies and Biological Sciences) and numerous collaborative efforts with
              researchers from other institutions in New Hampshire.
