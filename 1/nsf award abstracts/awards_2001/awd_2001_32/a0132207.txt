This grant provides partial support for the acquisition of a
              detector and software to add electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD)
              capabilities to an existing modern scanning electron microscope (SEM) in the
              Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Wyoming.  EBSD
              systems are a relatively new technology that allow for the rapid
              characterization of crystallographic preferred orientations (CPO) of thin
              sections materials at sub-micron resolutions.  The technology makes it possible
              to statistically characterize paleodeformation mechanisms in rocks with very
              small grain sizes that are impossible or very difficult to analyze using
              alternative techniques combining traditional optical microscopy and x-ray
              diffraction.  Detailed crystallographic information can also be very useful for
              studies of mineral surface processes and for characterizing the structure of
              organic molecules.   Research at Wyoming that will immediately benefit from
              this system includes studies of the deformation processes responsible for
              creating ultramafic mylonites collected from oceanic fracture zones, studies of
              mantle peridotites to elucidate the factors responsible for igneous cumulates
              and to aid in the interpretation of magma chamber dynamics, and studies of the
              interaction of pharmaceuticals with malaria pigment to aid in the design of
              more  effective antimaliaral drugs.
