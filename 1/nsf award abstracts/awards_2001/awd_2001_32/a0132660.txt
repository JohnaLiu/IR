Abstract

A sampling protocol for fungi (Discomycetes) found in Puerto
              Rico and the Dominican Republic will be developed.  Many of these fungi are
              inconspicuous and poorly studied, and it is not clear what survey methods
              should be used to discover the most species. The research is exploratory in
              that it will investigate methods for surveying fungi and lead to more effective
              and innovative research on a very poorly known group of organisms.  Ultimately,
              the methods will be incorporated into the "Greater Antilles Project," an
              ongoing inventory of the fungi of the Greater Antilles.  A webpage and database
              for the Discomycetes component of the Greater Antilles Project will be
              developed and include photographs, locality data, and ecological data.  Two
              students, one from Puerto Rico and one from the Dominican Republic, will be
              trained in sampling methods and taxonomy of Discomycetes.
