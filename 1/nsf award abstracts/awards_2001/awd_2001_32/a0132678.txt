Abstract    :
              With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division,
              Professor Kenneth B. Wiberg, of the Department of Chemistry at Yale University,
              will study the nature of the intramolecular interactions that control the
              structures, energies, spectra and other properties of organic molecules.
              Through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, Professor
              Wiberg will examine the intramolecular interactions that control the preferred
              conformations of molecules. Electrostatic interactions in organic molecules
              will also be studied making use of calculated group dipoles and examining the
              question of the effective dielectric constant both experimentally and
              computationally. Studies will also be done examining the nature of
              electronically excited states for cyclic and open chain alkenes, factors that
              control optical rotation and, hence, optical activity, and comparing the
              permanganate oxidation of alkenes with the reaction of alkenes with
              Cr(IV).

Professor Kenneth B. Wiberg, of the Department of Chemistry at Yale
              University, with the support of the Organic Dynamics Program, studies the
              properties of organic molecules using the synergistic interaction between
              experiment and theory to garner a richer detail of information than would be
              possible using either approach by itself.
