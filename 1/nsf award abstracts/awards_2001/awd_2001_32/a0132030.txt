Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
              demonstrate the ability to generate photostimulated luminescence (PSL) in
              nanoparticles. The potential applications in digital imaging and storage
              offered by PSL phosphors, including X-ray imaging could be significant. PSL
              phosphors currently in use present several drawbacks including greater expense
              and poorer resolution as compared to conventional screen-film methods. The
              quantum confinement of nanoparticles offers solutions to many of the
              shortcomings of existing PSL phosphors. The project will characterize
              nanoparticles with a goal of optimizing these materials for use as phosphors in
              thin films. The project will also fabricate the required thin films and compare
              them to commercially available PSL phosphors for performance, longevity, and
              other factors of interest.

The commercial applications will be widely
              applicable to digital imaging, offering high resolution, low cost, easy
              storage, low complexity, easy portability, and other desirable features.
              Materials with efficient PSL have great potential for technical applications
              such as optical storage, X-ray imaging, radiation measurements and quality
              control, optical dosimeters and dating, infrared sensors, image intensifiers,
              near-infrared-to-visible light converters, and bio-molecular structure
              recording and probing.
