Abstract    :
              A Center for Learning and Teaching in Technology Education would provide a focus
              for educating teachers and teacher educators who could implement the ideas of
              technology education as described in the recently produced Standards for
              Technological Literacy, as well as in the AAAS Benchmarks and the National
              Science Education Standards.  This planning grant is for the collaboration of
              the technology teacher education community and research  communities in science
              and technology education.  The planning determines a structure for graduate
              education in science and technology education, creates an agenda for research
              into how students learn technological concepts and how to use the information
              to implement the ideas of technological education in classrooms, and develops a
              technology teacher education curriculum.
