In this study, researchers at UCLA will develop further
              the new method of laser ablation sampling of rock materials for analysis by
              multiple collector inductively coupled plasma-source mass spectrometry
              (MC-ICPMS).  The new technology will permit researchers to use the isotopes of
              important and abundant rock-forming elements like magnesium, silicon, and iron
              as a means to discover the physical and chemical processes that affected rocks
              from a spectrum of environments.  These environments include the ocean floor,
              the insides of asteroids, and the deep sources of volcanoes.  Results will be
              used to elucidate details about a variety of phenomena related to the formation
              and subsequent evolution of the Earth.  Questions that will be addressed using
              the new technique include: how flowing water heated from undersea volcanoes
              affects the chemistry of Earth's crust; how rocks formed from gas and dust in
              the early solar system and how this process gave rise to rocky planets and
              satellites with large amounts of water, including Earth; the timescales of
              events leading to active volcanism on Earth; and the ways in which isotopes can
              be used to distinguish biological from non-biological chemical processes in
              rocks and in the atmosphere.
