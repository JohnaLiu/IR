Abstract    :
                   The intent of the project is to examine the impact of global or
              geographical distributedness on the coordination, control and reward systems in
              global software development project teams. Thus the primary resarch question
              addressed in the proposed research is: how does the distribution of project
              work across geographically, often globally, distributed work-sites impact the
              use and effectiveness of the coordination, control and reward systems in these
              project teams. The exploratory nature of the proposed work drives a combination
              of intensive qualitative research methods, including onsite observation,
              examination of project documentation, and in-depth interviews with project
              managers, project leaders, project members and other stakeholders at the
              various distributed sites. The PIs will also work with local informants and
              academics to help elicit and interpret the findings at each location.      A
              theory of the management of globally distributed projects and its associated
              empirical case data will be immediately useful, and is likely to contain
              generalizable knowledge for research and practice in the management of global
              software projects, a major undertaking both in the US and in organizations
              around the world. With the shift to global software projects, increasing
              interest in this area is anticipated, along with increasing need for
              well-founded theory. It is expected that the interviews will help to clarify
              project-specific team dynamics and dimensions of project management, which will
              be utilized to help refine and structure a subsequent theoretical framework and
              a design for a broader study. The subsequent work will depend upon the grounded
              theory developed in the present exploratory, empirical exploration.
