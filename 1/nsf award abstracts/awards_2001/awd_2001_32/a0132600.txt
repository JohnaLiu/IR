Abstract    :
              In this project funds are requested to continue studies of the equatorial
              thermospheric dynamics using the upgraded automated Arequipa Fabry-Perot
              interferometer (FPI) observatory operating at Arequipa which is ~400km south of
              the magnetic equator.  The instrumental upgrade increase of the FPI sensitivity
              by a factor of 15 is achieved by replacing the GaAs photomultipler with a
              back-thinned CCD detector.  The improved sensitivity of the Arequipa FPI will
              be used to extend current studies of the midnight temperature maximum and the
              equatorial wind and temperature anomaly (EWTA) with increased accuracy.  

A
              new line of research is proposed that would be based upon the observations of
              O+ and OH airglow emissions for the study of thermospheric [O].  The Doppler
              widths of the O+ spectral feature would provide information regarding the
              possible production of the hot oxygen corona that was previously observed with
              this technique in 1980.

If such hot [O] atoms exist near the equatorial
              upper thermosphere and exobase, aside from an increase in the effective Doppler
              width to equivalent temperatures of ~4000, an excess of a few Rayleighs of
              732nm emission rate relative to the FLIP predictions normalized by the
              observations at earlier solar depression angles should be seen.  The proposed
              732 nm measurements may resolve the question as to whether there exists and
              influx of fast oxygen ions into the equatorial ionosphere from the
              magnetosphere, which has been suggested to be caused by the polar O+ outflow
              that is diverted to the low latitude ionosphere by magnetospheric-ionospheric
              coupling processes.

During the night the Doppler shifts of the OH nightglow
              at 731.6 nm would be observed to determine mesospheric winds averaged over the
              OH volume emission profile with a centroid altitude of ~87km.  These results
              would be particularly useful in the support of the TIMED (thermosphere
              ionosphere mesosphere energetics and dynamics) satellite tidal studies as
              ground-based observations of mesospheric tidal winds in the Southern hemisphere
              are sparse.  A filter changer would select between the two filters, 630 nm and
              732 nm, as necessary to get the observations these science objectives require.
