Abstract    :
              This award funds the 'Learning in the Woods' project which aims to use a
              multi-faceted approach to integrate research and education on environmental
              change at interannual to interdecadal scales in the Great Basin, where rapid
              population growth is testing the vulnerability of natural and human-dominated
              ecosystems to climatic fluctuations. 

The primary goal of the research is to
              obtain a baseline representation, over the last millennium, of interannual to
              interdecadal changes in water supply and fire regime. The spatial and temporal
              patterns of wildfire will be analyzed in the context of climatic fluctuations.
              Tree-ring chronologies from moisture-sensitive species will be developed for
              selected watersheds, including the Truckee, Carson, Walker, Owens, and Humboldt
              River Basins. The annual to seasonal resolution of such natural archives allows
              for accurate calibration with instrumental records, so that multi-century long
              proxy series of annual to seasonal precipitation and stream flow can be
              obtained. 

In addition, a four-day science experience for K-12 teachers and
              students will be held every year, and aimed at Hispanic middle- and high-school
              students in Nevada.

The specific scientific and educational objectives
              include testing the spatial coherence of decadal-scale variability in Great
              Basin hydroclimatology, determining the amplitude of interannual to
              interdecadal fluctuations of freshwater input to selected watersheds of the
              Intermountain West over the past millennium, examining spatial and temporal
              changes of fire regime in connection to local and regional climate at annual
              resolution for several centuries, educating new generations on the dynamic
              relationships that exist both in space and in time between climate and surface
              processes such as precipitation, runoff, and wildfire, developing a web-based
              information system showing the spatial variability of precipitation, stream
              flow, and fire regime over Great Basin watersheds for the period of
              instrumental observations and for the period of proxy climatic records, and
              providing under-represented groups an incentive, early in their educational
              careers, for pursuing science careers.
