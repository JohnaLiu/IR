Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will develop advanced,
              nano-engineered thermal spray powders for producing composite coatings with
              revolutionary enhancements in performance.  The Phase I project demonstrated
              the production of high volume reinforced (25-65 wt % SiC) aluminum and nickel
              matrix composite materials using CVD fluid bed coated powders and low cost
              consolidation techniques.  Dramatic increases in flexure strength and modulus
              were achieved, with results showing greater than 5% (80% increase) ductility
              and a 600% increase in flexural strength compared to current metal matrix
              composite state of the art.   A greater understanding of the nano-engineered
              particles being produced, and the relationship between nano-structural features
              and the resulting mechanical property improvements will be developed leading to
              repeatable, predictable performance and application to additional composite and
              coatings systems.  

The commercial potential will be for producing low cost;
              high volume fraction consolidated spray-deposited composite systems with
              significant improvements in mechanical properties and desired physical
              properties for structural and corrosion applications for the electronic
              industry.
