Laser heating of metal-encapsulated accessory minerals has
              emerged as the most viable technique for accomplishing high-throughput,
              low-blank, and readily-tracked helium analysis for (U-Th)/He dating.  This
              award will provide funds for a CW TEMoo mode, Nd-YAG laser and optomechanical
              equipment for automated beam attenuation to develop a temperature controlled,
              laser-heated furnace system for helium analysis in the UCLA noble gas
              laboratory.  The laser system will become an essential component of the newly
              refurbished VG3600 extraction line that is now set up to perform 3He isotope
              dilution measurements.  The newly developed (U-Th)/He dating capabilities will
              support a number of NSF-sponsored projects that require efficient (U-Th)/He
              analysis of apatite and sphene.  The majority of these investigations are
              structural studies that rely upon low-temperature thermochronology to detect
              and characterize the magnitude and timing of Late Cenozoic crustal deformation.
               The itinerary of planned activities is broad and ranges from studies of the
              timing of the transition from water to steam-dominated conditions at The
              Geysers hydrothermal systems to detrital thermochronology in basins that border
              tectonically active areas.  An overarching consideration in all this activity
              is our desire to develop self-consistent interpretive models that incorporate
              both 40Ar/39Ar K-feldspar and (U-Th)/He apatite and sphene thermochronometers
              to derive nearly continuous thermal histories from middle crustal to surface
              conditions.
