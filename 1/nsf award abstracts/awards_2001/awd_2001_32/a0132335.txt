Using psychophysical and
              neurophysiological techniques, this research investigates several aspects of
              the important neural computations that are required for execution of visual
              orienting movements: 1) the mechanisms that mediate the transformation of
              sensory information into motor commands; 2) the neural computations required to
              decompose global motor commands observed at the level of the superior
              colliculus into signals required for coordinated contraction of muscles; and 3)
              the management of conflicting neural signals produced by the competition
              between motor commands and the sensory signals that are a direct result of the
              executed movements.
Specifically, this proposal will test the predictions of a
              hypothesis that states that a gaze-related command signal issued by the
              superior colliculus is decomposed by cells in the paramedian pontine reticular
              formation (PPRF) into separate eye and head control signals, and that eye-head
              coordination (observed during visual orienting movements) is mediated by the
              interactions of these signals.  The mechanisms for controlling head movements
              are largely unknown, and this proposal seeks to correlate cell activity with
              head movements during coordinated eye-head movements, during pursuit of moving
              targets, and during more natural movements that combine gaze shifts and pursuit
              movements.  This proposal will contribute to understanding how the brain
              accomplishes the required computations to coordinate more than 40 muscles and
              muscle groups to produce a smoothly coordinated re-direction of the line of
              sight.

In addition, this proposal will contribute to the development of
              courses based on the idea that students' desire to understand general
              principles will lead to their own investigation of the details, using in-class
              lectures and small group discussions.  Increased numbers of undergraduate,
              graduate, and postdoctoral students will participate in the laboratory research
              proposed, both during the academic year and in a summer undergraduate
              internship program.
