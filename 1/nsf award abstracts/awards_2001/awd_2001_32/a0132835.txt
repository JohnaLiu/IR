Abstract    :
              Drs. Sibrina Collins and Isiah Warner of Louisiana State University are
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry and Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities Programs for support of minority students to
              attend a special poster session at Pittconn 2002, a major international meeting
              for analytical chemists in New Orleans LA March 17-22, 2002.  The poster
              session is to be held in conjunction with a special symposium celebrating
              diversity in the field of analytical chemists, featuring reknown speakers from
              a variety of backgrounds.  The requested funds are to support the travel costs
              of undergraduate minority students, making possible an increased attendance of
              minority students at this meeting.
