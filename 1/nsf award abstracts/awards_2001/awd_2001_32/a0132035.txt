Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will combine the
              Internet, electronic libraries, and a new machine learning technique that
              simulates human understanding of text to produce an independent learning and
              problem-solving environment for individuals and groups.  Using Latent Semantic
              Analysis (LSA), Auto-autodidact (autodidact: a self-taught person) first learns
              the vocabulary and concepts of a topic by automatic training on textbooks. 
              Then, as students study and write, and groups discuss and plan, it will
              continuously evaluate what they know and do not know, find relevant information
              anywhere in an electronic library, and connect participants with complementary
              needs and knowledge.  Auto-autodidact capitalizes on the motivational power of
              peer interaction, the instant availability of enormous textual resources, and
              the possibility of sharing individual knowledge over time and space. 
              Auto-autodidact will integrate LSA with a state-of-art environment for
              distributed knowledge-building discussion and newly available electronic
              libraries to provide continuous embedded assessment, tutorial dialogue, and
              meaning-based information insertion.  It will be unique in its ability to
              construct a learning environment for a new domain, customizing it for the needs
              of either an individual learner or a collaborating team, in a matter of days or
              even minutes.

As we move into a networked world, Knowledge Analysis
              Technologies' proffered technology has the potential to weave together people
              and ideas, generating knowledge and fostering collaboration.  If the project
              realizes its potential and consistently delivers useful results to users, it
              could transform how we interact with data and with one another.
