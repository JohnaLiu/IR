Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will
              develop an entirely new form of machine vision technology for process control
              of metallic components. The technology is based on an array of giant
              magnetoresistance (GMR) sensors that produce high-resolution images of hidden
              defects, missing parts, and other features. Minute GMR sensors detect magnetic
              fields associated with eddy currents
induced in the component being imaged.
              High spatial resolution images are achieved through the high density and small
              size of the sensors in the array, coupled with the high sensitivity, low noise,
              and fast response of the sensors. A GMR sensor array, combined with a magnetic
              field generator, can produce high resolution, three-dimensional images of parts
              as they are produced, using a rugged, non-contacting sensor system. The images
              provide on-line feedback for process control, quality assurance, and safety
              protocols.
The Phase I project developed functional GMR sensor arrays, and
              successfully imaged
defects in metallic parts clearly demonstrating that the
              technology is feasible. 
     The commercial potential of the proposed
              technology will be in manufacturing, quality assurance (QA), and process
              control. It will be used for rapid imaging and inspection of parts used in
              electronics, aerospace, automotive, transportation, construction, biomedical
              and other industries.
