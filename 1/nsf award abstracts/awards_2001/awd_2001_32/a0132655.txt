Abstract    :
              The mechanisms by which cells repair DNA interstrand crosslinks remain largely
              unknown.  In mammals, the nucleotide excision repair endonuclease XPF-Ercc1
              plays a key role in interstrand crosslink repair.  This function is conserved
              in the Drosophila XPF homolog MEI-9.  This project concerns the interaction
              between MEI-9 and a newly identified crosslink repair protein, MUS312.  Genetic
              analyses of mus312 mutants will be done to better understand which repair and
              recombination pathways require mus312, and to what extent mus312 and mei-9 act
              in the same pathways.  Additional alleles of mus312 will be generated to better
              understand the MUS312 protein.  Both mei-9 and mus312 are also essential for
              generating meiotic crossovers, and this function will also be studied
              genetically and molecularly.

DNA is under constant attack by both internal
              and external agents; several chemotherapy agents exert their effects by
              creating interstrand crosslinks in DNA.  The mechanisms by which normal cells
              repair this type of damage are unknown.  The present research seeks to
              understand the contribution to this repair of two key proteins, MEI-9 and
              MUS312.  These proteins interact physically to carry out this repair process in
              Drosophila melanogaster.
