Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and
              commercialize the Magnetic Pulse Welding (MPW) system, a novel materials
              joining process.  The goal is to establish MPW as a reliable and economic
              method to weld tubular structures.  The project will conduct research and
              engineering that will address the critical technical hurdles for the commercial
              implementation and dissemination of the new welding technology.  

The
              commercial applications would revolutionize the assembly process of the
              hydroformed tubular structures in automotive chassis and space frame
              applications.  This process will promote the hybrid automotive body structure
              design that uses tubes of both aluminums and steels and will enable joining of
              different materials such as titanium to superalloys for aerospace and
              electronic applications.
