Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
              advanced carbon electrode materials for ultracapacitors. Presently,
              ultracapacitor voltages are limited to 2.3 - 2.7 V/cell. New carbonaceous
              electrode materials are expected to increase cell potential limits to >3.6 V.
              Given the quadratic dependence of energy density on cell potential, these
              materials will increase ultracapacitor energy storage by >100%. The increased
              cell potential will reduce device size and cost by reducing the number of cells
              required to attain a given voltage rating. Phase II will demonstrate that these
              materials can withstand extended charge/discharge cycling to high voltage. A
              scalable process will be developed to produce the new carbon electrode
              materials. Prototype ultracapacitors will be produced to support customer
              demonstrations.

The commercial potential of this project is for
              ultracapacitors that are used in portable electronic devices, power
              conditioning (UPS), and electromechanical actuators. Additional applications
              include hybrid electric and conventional vehicles to service intermittent high
              power loads (e.g. regenerative braking, engine start, electromechanical valves,
              and electric power steering).
