Abstract    :
              This NSF CAREER award supports the integration of scientific research and
              education within the context of developing a deeper understanding of climate
              processes.  The research objective is to improve our understanding of
              large-scale climate variability in the Southern Hemisphere in the context of
              the Southern Hemisphere "annular oscillation" (AO), a robust feature of the
              atmosphere's general circulation that accounts for a substantial amount of
              climate variance.  The education activities are the following: the development
              of new curriculum and mentoring of graduate students.  This research is
              important because the AO, a natural mode of the atmosphere, has been shown to
              have a large influence on weather and climate; however, the basic processes
              that control its development and characteristics are poorly understood and
              controversial.
