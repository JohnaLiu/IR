Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will proceed
              with the development of a fully automated and integrated pest management (IPM)
              system. The goal of IPM is to minimize reliance on pesticides by emphasizing
              the moment-to-moment knowledge of the field situation to dynamically make
              decisions and deliver timely, targeted actions. Current IPM programs use data
              collection technologies from early 1900s, thus lacking speed and integration
              necessary to generate reports required by decision-makers who need to act
              quickly. With the Phase II development of a robust centralized Internet hub
              housing expert systems for automated data analysis, reporting (with GIS) and
              quick distribution of information, the benefits to agriculture will be
              unsurpassed.

The company targets its suite of field data management and
              decision-making tools the pest management market.
