Abstract    :
                  This STTR Phase II project will result in the creation of an advanced
              network capability to enable ad-hoc networks to operate in a low bandwidth
              undersea environment. The specific application of the resultant capability will
              be to support Autonomous Undersea Systems Networks (AUSNET), which are fleets
              of unmanned robotic vehicles that can provide survey, search, and monitoring
              functions for customer bases including the oil industry, environmental
              monitoring, undersea communications infrastructure, search and rescue, and
              military applications. The capability will build upon the emerging standard
              Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols to create a network that is entirely
              self-configuring, bandwidth conserving, and tailored to the unique requirements
              of cooperative undersea robotic operations. The two technical thrusts of the
              effort include AUSNET low-level protocol development, and higher level
              Application Programmer Interface specification and development.
     The
              cooperative Autonomous Undersea Vehicle (AUV) market is emerging and
              substantial. There are currently 17 companies selling undersea communications
              devices, each of which is a candidate licensee for AUSNET technology. Near term
              application of Phase II results is anticipated in Naval applications. Even
              greater application is to be found in support of offshore undersea operations
              addressing requirements of the oil industry, communications (undersea cable)
              installation and maintenance, environmental survey and monitoring, search and
              rescue operations, and exploration/scientific research.
