Abstract    :
              Abstract CTS-0132364 Somasundaran, P Columbia U  SURFACE TREATMENT OF
              FIBERS USING NEW SILICONE BASED SURFACTANTS  Fibers and fabrics used for the
              manufacture of various protective barriers are normally subjected to finishing
              operations for desired modification of their surface properties. Although many
              of these processes have been practiced, for example for over 30 years in the
              fabric industries, there are significant process variations. The process
              development and formulation optimization are established mostly through
              empirical approaches without the understanding of the fundamentals of these
              processes. This creates a lack of general guidelines for modifying different
              new fibers/fabrics/membranes as they are introduced into the industries. The
              objective of this exploratory project is to develop a basic understanding of
              the finishing processes used and to elucidate the role of the parameters
              responsible for its surface characteristics and performance properties. This
              will involve measurement of the reagent adsorption/adhesion, molecular
              conformation and orientation of the adsorbents, interactions among reagents
              such as polymers and surfactants, nano-structures of the surface aggregates
              formed by these reagents and correlation of the results to the fabric surface
              properties such as surface charge, hydrophobicity and fluid penetration. As the
              proposed research has the objective of controlling the surface properties using
              a new class of surface modifiers based on silicones, the outcome should make a
              significant contribution to the advancement of fabric/membrane products.
              Testing of these compounds is admittedly a high risk attempt but if perfected
              should lead to safer and eco-friendly products with enhanced performance.
              Towards this purpose, the next step will involve study of interactions of
              designed nanoparticles with fabrics and their crosslinking for superior finish,
              fire resistance, durability and chemical and biological agent resistance.
