Abstract    :
              The foci of this research are three-fold.  First , a novel [4+2]-cycloaddition
              -rearrangement sequence will be used to set the ABCE cyclic core of the
              aspidosperma alkaloid skeleton.  Second, a tandem thionium/N-acyliminium  ion
              cyclization strategy will be used to afford the pyrrolo[2,3-d]carbazole ring
              framework found in deethylibophyllidene.  Third, the transition metal mediated
              cyclization of acetylenic diazoketoamides will be studied as a route to the
              synthesis of a number of alkaloids including strychnine.

With this Renewal
              award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
              research efforts of Dr. Albert Padwa of the Department of Chemistry at Emory
              University.  Professor Padwa will focus his work on the development of tandem,
              or cascade, methods for the formation of several carbon-carbon bonds and/or
              rings systems in a single operation. Using combinations of cationic, anionic,
              radical, carbenoid or pericyclic processes will lead to the preparation of
              structurally diverse synthetic targets possessing interesting biological
              properties.  The research has broader impact for the training of graduate
              students and for  the development of methodology pertinent to the
              pharmaceutical industry.
