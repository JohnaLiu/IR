Abstract    :
              Lay Abstract

The International Union for the Study of Social Insects is
              devoted to
integrated analyses of the biology of this important group of
              organisms.
It holds an international meeting once every four years that has
              emerged as
the premier forum for the dissemination of knowledge in this field.
               Funds
are requested to send a group of carefully selected graduate students
              to
the meeting that will be held in Sapporo, Japan in July-Aug, 2002. 
              The
opportunity to attend this important meeting will have a significant
              impact
on the development of the careers of these students by allowing them
              to
begin to meet leaders of the field, develop contacts that can lead
              to
productive collaborations, and get feedback on their own work.  Japan has
              a
well established tradition of excellence in social insect biology
              and
offers an outstanding venue for this meeting.
