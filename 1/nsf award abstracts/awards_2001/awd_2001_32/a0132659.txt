Abstract    :
              This research proposes to exploit timing diagrams to improve formal verification
              for system designs.  Formal verification is a valuable debugging technique, but
              scalability and usability problems hinder its broader use.  Timing diagrams
              promise to alleviate both problems because they arise from the design community
              and engender more restrictive computational models than existing verification
              notations. The proposed research (1) enhances timing diagrams with constructs
              needed to capture realistic verification problems and (2) develops scalable and
              compositional verification techniques that exploit timing diagrams' unique
              computational characteristics for improved scalability and efficiency.  The
              educational aspect of this project focuses on increasing students' skills in
              modeling and reasoning about system designs through a combination of curricular
              enhancements and hands-on projects.  The combination of these research and
              educational objectives enables wider adoption and increased feasibility of
              formal verification in real-world design practice.
