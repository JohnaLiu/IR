Abstract    :
              The e-Print Archive has been a major advance in the dissemination of scientific
              research.  It has effectively transformed the research communication
              infrastructure of multiple fields of physics and other scientific communities. 
              It has been in operation since 1991 and has recently moved its base from Los
              Alamos National Labs to Cornell University.  It has experienced continuous
              growth and has become in such general use that the APS and the University of
              California Digital Library have become mirror sites.  Other scientific research
              areas are utilizing the archiving system as well.  The number of submissions
              are over 20,000 per year and the site processes about 3 million transactions
              per month.  The project has positively influenced the process and progress of
              scientific research and can be credited with many of the innovations in the
              electronic transfer and sharing of scientific information.  It provides rapid
              access to current research at both larger and smaller research institutions and
              allows fuller participation in research by developing countries.  It represents
              research at the leading edge of electronic dissemination of scientific
              information and continues to provide a service of great value to a number of
              scientific disciplines.  Its continued development will have a strong influence
              on scientific advances in many disciplines.
