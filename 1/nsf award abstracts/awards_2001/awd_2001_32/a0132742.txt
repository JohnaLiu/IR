Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
              technologies to generate meshes over general three-dimensional domains that are
              appropriate for high-order finite element analysis. A current stumbling block
              to the wide adoption of high-order finite element techniques is the lack of
              automatic means to generate appropriate curved meshes. This project will
              develop a new and innovative procedure for the effective generation of these
              types of meshes.

The commercial application of this research is the
              integration of CAD technologies with advanced automated simulation techniques
              to be used within engineering design processes. These tools will reduce the
              time and costs associated with performing engineering analysis during design
              and increase the accuracy of the predictions obtained.
