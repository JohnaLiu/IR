This grant provides partial support for acquisition of an
              inductively coupled plasma, optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) and sundry
              sample preparation equipment.  The newly established ICP facility in the
              Department of Geology, University of Vermont, will be dedicated to research
              relying on high precision trace element analyses of natural samples and the
              teaching of students with ICP analytical techniques and their applications. 
              The new ICP lab will serve faculty members Bierman, Klepeis, Lini and Rusher
              for studies including determination of post-glacial surficial weathering rates,
              investigations of the petrogenesis of igneous plutons, research on experimental
              phase equilibria, and environmental impact studies.
