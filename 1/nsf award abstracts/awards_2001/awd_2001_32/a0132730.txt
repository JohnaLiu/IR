The objectives
              of this proposed research are: (1) to develop efficient and robust
              three-dimensional simulation tools for the design, optimization, and control of
              manufacturing processes of polymeric materials, and (2) to use the simulation
              tools to investigate thermostatic effects on the stability of polymeric flows
              in complex geometric shapes likely to be encounter in industrial processes. 
              The problem to be considered are flow in concentric cylinders, flow through
              arrays of cylinders in a channel, multilayer shear flows, uniaxial and/or
              biaxial extension, and fiber spinning.  The broader impact of the proposed
              research is the development of simulation tools for industrial processes, to
              train graduate students in materials research and development, and to enhance
              the undergraduate students' design experience.
