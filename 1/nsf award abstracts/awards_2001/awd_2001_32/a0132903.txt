Two-layer dynamics of sill flows will be studied with analytic
              and numerical techniques.  Particular issues to be addressed include the nature
              of hydraulic transitions and upstream influence, effects of separation of the
              interface from side-walls, transport relationships, special features such as
              hydraulic jumps and recirculations, and procedures for assessing flow
              criticality.  Interest will be focused more on the inflow and throughflow
              regions, rather than on the effluent plume that sinks at the outflow.
