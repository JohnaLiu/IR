Abstract    :
              



This award to the Polar Research Board is to establish a Committee on
              Frontiers in Polar Biology. The Committee will examine the opportunities and
              challenges of using modern technologies and methods of biology for conducting
              research on Arctic and Antarctic organisms. The committee will seek to identify
              the most important research questions that can be addressed using the new
              approaches and to recommend ways to facilitate and accelerate the transfer and
              use of genomic technologies to answer fundamental questions about Arctic and
              Antarctic organisms. 
The Committee's work will result in a consensus report
              with conclusions and recommendations that will highlight the potential of these
              new areas and provide guidance about research opportunities.
