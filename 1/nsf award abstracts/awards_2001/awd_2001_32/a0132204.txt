Funds from this grant will support the acquisition of a
              state-of-the-art scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an environmental cell
              which allows for imaging of hydrated samples at variable pressures.  The
              so-called environmental SEM (ESEM) will also be configured with an energy
              dispersive x-ray spectrometer (EDS) to allow for quantitative compositional
              analysis of samples.  The ESEM facility at Bucknell will support the research
              programs of faculty members Chris Daniel (metamorphic petrology/structural
              geology), Beth Capaldi (entomology), Carl Kirby (environmental geochemistry)
              and Margot Vigeant (Chemical Engineering) and their students at this liberal
              arts institution.  Specific research thrusts include investigations of the
              Proterozoic tectonic history of the southwestern U.S. based on SEM and EMP
              analyses of metamorphic phases to elucidate their P-T history and patterns of
              chemical zoning, investigations of bacterial interactions with solid iron
              phases found in rocks exposed to acid mine drainage, studies of biofilms on
              medical devices and industrial piping and structural studies of live
              pollen-insect interactions to elucidate insect sensory structures and
              mechanisms.
