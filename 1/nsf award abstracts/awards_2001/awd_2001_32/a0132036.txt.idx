Abstract    :
              0132036 Bromwich   	This award will provide funds for the support of a
              planning workshop for the Ross Island Meteorology Experiment, a project to
              integrate the results of advanced research techniques into antarctic weather
              forecasting.   The workshop will be held at the Byrd Polar Research Center of
              Ohio State University, in September 2001. 	The objective of the workshop is to
              bring together the atmospheric community with research interests in antarctic
              synoptic meteorology.  This group, which will include operational forecasters,
              numerical modelers, atmospheric scientists, and others, will be expected to
              define and recommend realizable goals for the synoptic meteorology program of
              the U.S. Antarctic Program, and to define the core requirements of research
              project in the McMurdo Sound/Ross Ice Shelf area which will achieve these
              goals. 	Recent advances in polar numerical weather prediction, resulting from
              ongoing efforts at improving the capabilities of numerical weather prediction
              models for use in polar regions, and real-time simulations of the antarctic
              atmosphere using the Penn State University/National Center for Atmospheric
              Research fifth generation mesoscale model have placed the field of antarctic
              weather prediction at the brink of a period of rapid improvement.  This
              potential can only be realized through a directed research program with the
              goal of providing an observational database to validate the modeling
              effort. 	The need for this workshop was recognized and articulated at the
              Antarctic Weather Forecasting Workshop held at Ohio State University in May
              2000. ***
