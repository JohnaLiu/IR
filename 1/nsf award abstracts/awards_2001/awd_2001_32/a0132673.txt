ABSTRACT:

This project will implement
              an integrated program of empirical
software-engineering research and an
              exemplar of education in
empirical methods for undergraduate and graduate
              students in
software engineering. This will be achieved through
              research
focused on assessing the quality of open-source software
              for
high-performance computing, and through development of relevant
courses
              and teaching modules.

High-performance computing is the platform of choice
              in many fields
of science and engineering that are critical to modern
              society.
Off-the-shelf software packages in this category include tools
              to
implement mathematical models, and middleware to manage parallel
and
              distributed computation. The open-source approach of software
development is
              becoming increasingly attractive in this field.

Research activities of this
              program will employ empirical analysis
methods to find ways to assess the
              quality of open-source software
for high-performance computing, enabling
              scientific and engineering
users to make better informed choices. Case studies
              of selected
software products will validate the practicality and usefulness
              of
obtaining such quality assessments.

Software-engineering education in
              America is largely lacking
instruction in empirical analysis methods. A
              spectrum of teaching
materials targeted toward this need will be developed. 
              Research
results and instructional materials will be disseminated
              through
publications and the NSF-sponsored Center for Empirically
              Based
Software Engineering (CeBASE).
