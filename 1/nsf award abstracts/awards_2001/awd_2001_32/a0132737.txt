Abstract    :
              Carbon has two stable forms, 12C and 13C.  Both forms are used in
              photosynthesis, but plants have a slight preference for 12C, so plants are
              ENRICHED in 12C compared with atmospheric CO2.  Furthermore, the degree of
              enrichment indicates variations in plant physiology.  This knowledge has long
              been used to study physiology of individual plants; our study applies these
              concepts to studies of WHOLE ECOSYSTEMS.  By sampling air at night at the mouth
              of small, well-defined watersheds, and analyzing carbon isotopes in respired
              CO2, we believe we can monitor the physiological responses of the ecosystems
              within the watersheds to environmental change.  We will test this concept in
              two small watersheds, and will also design and test equipment to automatically
              sample air for the isotope analyses.  At least two undergraduates will be
              involved in this study each field season.
