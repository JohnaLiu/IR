Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to fund two workshops to bring together computer science and
              digital library researchers from the US and India, to forward the work of the
              "million book project".    It is important to maintain coordination between the
              countries so that the international collaboration is maintained and the work
              can proceed in a unified and most productive way.  The topics discussed will
              include scanning technology, selection of materials, and related issues.
