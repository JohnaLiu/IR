Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will investigate the
              use of a new high temperature amorphous oxide material, CerablakTM, as a
              protective coating on components used in the molten aluminum industry. 
              CerablakTM is a newly discovered sol-gel derived material that is thermally
              stable up to 1400 degrees Celsius over many hours.  A patented precursor is
              used to form a continuous, dense, and smooth thin film using a simple dip
              coating process.  The key property of CerablakTM is its relatively low oxygen
              diffusivity which enables its use for oxidation protection of metal and alloy
              surfaces exposed to elevated temperatures.  The Phase I project showed that the
              material is non-wetting and compatible with molten aluminum.  CerablakTM
              coatings developed on full-size thermocouple protection tubes showed excellent
              durability and non-wetting behavior.  The Phase II project will optimize the
              coating quality for use in protection of thermocouple protection tubes, riser
              stalk tubes, molds, and dies. 
     The commercial applications include
              protective coatings for metals and alloys used in turbine components and
              petrochemical refining, molten metal processing, thermal protection systems for
              space propulsion, cookware, and glass.
