Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to develop methodology for the preparation of
              biologically relevant C-saccharides and C-glycoside analogs of carbohydrate
              contining natural products.  One approach uses a ring closing metathesis (RCM))
              strategy for the preparation of C-1 glycals, which are, in turn,  readily
              functionalized and transformed into 2-deoxy C-glycosides of
              2-gluco-C-glycosides.  A second approach uses an iterative tethering-olefin
              metathesis strategy for the preparation of C-oligosaccharides.

With this new
              award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
              research activities of Dr. Maarten H. Postema of the Department of Chemistry at
              Wayne State University.  Professor Postema will focus his work on developing
              methodology for the preparation of stable and unique saccharide mimics. 
              Carbohydrates are an important class of organic structures.  When joined at the
              cell surface to form oligosaccharides, they play an important role in cellular
              recognition, metastasis and adhesion.  The stable C-saccharides and
              C-glycosides generated by the methodology of this project have implications for
              the pharmaceutical industry.  The project also presents an attractive venue for
              the training of graduates students.
