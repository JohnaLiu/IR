Abstract    :
              Enormous demand to analyze and construct stochastic models describing
              various situations in the modern world has created new fast growing research
              fields that include financial mathematics, telecommunications, transportation,
              manufacturing, energy and biomedicine.  Powerful techniques from stochastic
              theory and stochastic control have allowed to formulate and to solve a number
              of problems arising in these cutting-edge disciplines.  The workshop will
              focus on building closer collaborations among stochastic control researchers
              .It will focus on promoting collaborative initiatives in stochastic theory and
              control as well as in stochastic theory and control education.
