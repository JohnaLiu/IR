Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project describes the
              development of a Capillary Breakup Rheometer (CaBER) from a proven breadboard
              design to a commercially viable instrument for both analytical and process
              control functions. In this document the results of the successful completion of
              a Phase I SBIR are outlined.  The fundamental operation of the CaBER's
              component parts is supported by data that validates the chosen components and
              verifies the suitability of the design. In addition, sample data from model
              fluids will be used to both illustrate the functionality of the CaBER and to
              highlight the broad applicability of the instrument. Ongoing developments of
              the CaBER  include more robust software analysis, cheaper manufacturing costs
              and a more intuitive user interface. These improvements will result in an
              instrument that is invaluable to industry in both a research laboratory and a
              process control environment.  
     Currently there is only one commercially
              available extensional rheometer and a handful of academic rheometer designs. 
              By providing a virtually unique tool for the determination of extensional
              viscosity in a freely draining fluid thread, this instrument will fill a
              segment of the instrumentation field that as here to fore been neglected.
