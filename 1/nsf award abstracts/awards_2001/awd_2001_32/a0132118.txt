Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will demonstrate
              using a prototype design the commercial feasibility of electrospinning to
              produce nanofibers. Nanofibers will be combined with conventional filter media
              to form a novel NanoFilter media for liquid and air filtration applications.
              These applications have been shown to remove particles smaller than 3 microns
              from effluent streams with superior filtering efficiency and attractive cost
              potential. The acrylic nanofibers will be electrospun as a nanoweb directly on
              to a conventional support (filter media) substrate. The web will be combined
              with a protective cover layer to form a sandwich structure, which will be
              collected as a roll. The filter will be easily tailored to achieve the desired
              composite filter performance by varying architecture: substrates, nanofiber
              diameter, nanoweb density, and the nanoweb thickness. This project will be
              carried out collaboratively with academic centers and major corporations as its
              strategic partners. 
     Nanotechnologies developed in the coming years will
              form the foundation for a significant commercial platform.  Commercial
              applications in a variety of filtration processes such as: high-end industrial
              raw material purification, biological separations, ultra pure air and water
              systems, hospital clean rooms, agriculture and food industries filters, and
              microelectronic industries next generation clean environment needs are
              anticipated.
