Abstract    :
              In the first few years of life, children learn a great deal about the causal
              structure of the world around them; they learn how some events make other
              events happen.  This knowledge is reflected in children's everyday "theories"
              of the world.  How does this learning take place?  This research program will
              investigate the underlying mechanisms for causal learning in children.  In
              particular, the research will explore how children use information about
              contingencies between events, such as the fact that one event always follows
              another event, to draw conclusions about causal relationships.  It will
              investigate how children learn about inhibitory causes, interactive causes and
              hidden, unobserved causes.  This work is informed by recent work in computer
              science and statistics that shows how computers can make accurate causal
              inferences.  This work should have significant broader impact for educational
              practice.  Causal relationships play a crucial role in scientific knowledge. 
              If we understand children's basic natural causal learning mechanisms, we can
              use this understanding to help teach science more effectively.  Similarly, this
              research has impact for studies of developmental disabilities such as autism
              and mental retardation.  There is reason to think that children with these
              syndromes may have particular difficulty with causal learning, and
              understanding natural causal learning may help us understand and remedy these
              difficulties.
