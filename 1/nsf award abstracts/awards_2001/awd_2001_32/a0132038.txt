Abstract    :
              Due to the advent of highly complex manufacturing, communication, and computer
              systems, there has been an increased need for more complex and realistic
              mathematical models to analyze and control such systems. A particularly
              striking example is seen in semiconductor wafer fabrication, where one facility
              may manufacture multiple products which traverse a labyrinthine route
              consisting of hundreds of steps. Factors such as reentrant routing, varied
              processing speeds, setup times, and machine downtimes make such systems
              particularly difficult to evaluate and control.

Fluid models in queueing can
              be thought of as a relaxation of an original multiclass queuing network which
              can provide crucial insight into the operation of complex reentrant systems.
              The proposed research plan involves exploring fluid model techniques for
              efficient scheduling of multiclass queuing models. First we propose developing
              robust and efficient algorithms for solving a fluid model control problem. Then
              we will develop techniques for translating the solution to the fluid control
              problem into a feasible near-optimal schedule for the original. Finally, we
              will test the applicability of our methods using realistic wafer fab data of
              practical size and scope, drawing on a partnership with International SEMATECH
              for fab data and benchmark simulation models.  The proposed education plan is
              tied in with the research plan and involves new course development and software
              development for undergraduate courses and graduate courses in operations
              research modeling and queueing theory.
