Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II Project substantially
              furthers the development of a powerful means to simultaneously measure trace
              amounts of multiple species vital to environmental control, industrial process
              control, and human health and safety. A fast, flexible, accurate, and low
              power-consuming technique, prism Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) will
              measure trace species to levels as low as parts-per-trillion. The research
              completed in Phase I demonstrated that the technology requires prisms
              fabricated from high-purity, super polished materials of high optical
              homogeneity. Phase I served both to identify appropriate materials to construct
              a fully functional prism and to prove that the prism cavity operates from the
              near UV down to the near IR range, greatly enhancing the breadth of CRDS
              performance.

The commercial market for the prism cavity lends itself to a
              wide range of applications: manufacture of compound semiconductors for
              telecommunications; continuous emissions monitoring for environmental
              compliance and workplace safety; laser weapon development and performance
              verification; detection of explosives or chemical warfare agents; and chemical
              analysis of breath for medical diagnostics.
