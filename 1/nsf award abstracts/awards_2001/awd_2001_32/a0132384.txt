Abstract    :
              The Maine EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement award is designed to
              enhance Maine's competitiveness in molecular biophysical sciences through a
              partnership between the University of Maine and Maine's non-profit research
              organizations.  The proposed Biophysical Sciences Institute brings together
              University of Maine faculty in physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and
              spatial engineering, with biomedical researchers at the Jackson Laboratory and
              Maine Medical Center Research Institute.  Maine EPSCoR proposes to hire
              additional tenure-track faculty in the fields of biophysics and advanced
              optics, biochemistry, structural biology, applied mathematics, computer
              science, image analysis and visualization, and material science.  The new and
              existing investigators will form research teams to develop new measurement
              techniques, new sensors, and innovative approaches to data processing and
              interpretation in intracellular structures and dynamics, functional materials
              as a means to manipulate cellular reactions, and biocomputing.  In addition to
              establishing the institute, Maine EPSCoR will integrate research and education
              through improvements to graduate training.
