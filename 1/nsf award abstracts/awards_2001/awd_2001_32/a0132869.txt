Abstract    :
              Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) failure is a devastating reliability problem 
to
              VDSM (very-deep-sub-micron) and nano-scale Si ULSI IC technologies. 
It is
              imperative to investigate ESD failure fundamentals and on-chip ESD
 protection
              theories focusing on the following challenges: 3D mixed-mode 
ESD simulation
              methodology; accurate high-current ESD modeling; whole-chip 
ESD design
              synthesis, advanced ESD protection solutions for ULSI ICs, ESD
protection for
              super-GHz RF ICs, ESD protection for nano-scale as well 
as wide-bandgap
              semiconductor IC technologies. The PI proposes a 
career development plan that
              addresses these challenges.

Proposed research activities consist of six
              tasks: to investigate 
advanced on-chip ESD protection phenomena in ULSI ICs
              by developing a novel 
3D mixed-mode ESD simulation methodology; to
              investigate ESD 
protection fundamentals by developing accurate high-current
              ESD device 
models; to develop a full-chip ESD design verification CAD tool
              called 
ESDcat; to explore novel ultra-fast ESD protection solutions for
              
sub-100nm ULSI ICs, to explore ESD protection for future nano-technologies,
              
and to extend ESD research to super-GHz RF ICs and wide-bandgap
              
semiconductor, GaN. 

Since ESD phenomena are geometry-dependent involving
              complex
 electro-thermal-process-device-circuit coupling, the proposed
              
research procedures take full-scale mixed-mode approaches that investigate
              
ESD fundamentals in a fully-coupled
              process-device-circuit-electronic-thermal
 closed-loop in 3D format. A 3D
              parallel ESD model network is proposed 
for accurate high-current ESD
              modeling. ESDcat enables chip level ESD 
synthesis and verification at both
              schematic and layout levels. Nano-scale 
ESD research will take into account
              the ballistic phonon scattering 
effect. ESD for wide-bandgaps will focus on
              Si-compatible GaN ICs. 
End results include insights into ESD mechanisms, CAD
              tools for further 
investigation and design of ESD protections for various IC
              technologies, 
e.g., CMOS, BiCMOS, SOI, SiGe, GaN, RFIC, and Cu interconnects.
              Both 
new ESD theory and immediate industrial applications are
              expected.

The education plan centers on: new curriculum development;
              integration 
of microelectronics research and education; student mentoring and
              
community services; and university-industry collaboration. Specifically,

              activities include: develop five courses/labs in a five-year period; 
pursue
              an improved microelectronics teaching approach; establish an 
Integrated
              Electronics Laboratory, a Virtual IC Fab facility, and 
TCAD/ECAD Design
              Studios; advising students in conducting 
inter-professional projects; develop
              a undergraduate industrial 
co-op program; and involving minority/women
              students in microelectronics
 research. This five-year education proposal is
              integrated into 
the departmental redevelopment plan in microelectronics
