Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop
              software and hardware products that assist people with low vision to
              efficiently read and process information from many sources.  These products
              will combine optical character recognition (OCR), speech synthesis and
              recognition technologies, together with customizable displays based on the
              latest vision research to accommodate a variety of visual impairments.  These
              products will incorporate a 'Pick and Click' user interface, developed in Phase
              I, which does not require viewing the screen, yet presents visual displays
              useful to a low vision person, and is intuitive to fully sighted teachers
              experienced with graphical user interfaces (GUIs).  Included in the products
              will be functions particular to the low vision market, such as reading text
              optimally, enlarging pictures, and using a video camera for magnification while
              handwriting and viewing 3D objects.  In addition, 'Pick and Click' interfaces
              to the most common computer applications programs, such as word processing,
              e-mail, Internet browser, spreadsheet, and financial accounting will be
              included.
     Low vision users will benefit from a low cost interface that
              provides a clean and less cluttered presentation of information on the screen. 
              JBliss Imaging's proffered new technology has potential to improve access to
              and capability of manipulating information for the low vision population..  The
              technology also has potential to serve individuals with other disabilities,
              such as dyslexia and other forms of challenges to learning and reading
              abilities.  Commercial applications are in schools, libraries, businesses, and
              homes.
