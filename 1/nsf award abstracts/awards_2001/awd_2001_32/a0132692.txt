Under this CAREER Award, the investigator will develop a
              comprehensive research program in Microscale Hepatic Tissue Engineering
              oriented towards elucidating the structure/function relationship of the liver. 
              The liver architecture in vivo will be used as a guide to quantitatively
              investigate and optimize hepatocyte-to-hepatocycte cell interactions,
              hepatocycte-to-non-parenchymal cell interactions, cell-to-extracellular matrix
              interactions, and the role of soluble cues. Micropatterned surfaces conjugated
              with the adhesive peptide RGD as a model extracellular matrix will be used to
              ligate integrins and control cell-to-cell interactions in 2D.  Photopolymerized
              PEG hydrogels conjugated with RGD will be used to present an adhesive peptide
              to aggregated hepatocytes in a 3D context.  Photopatterning of cell-containing
              hydrogels will be used to explore 3D features of tissue structure. 
              Collectively, the studies will provide fundamental insight into the cross-talk
              between integrins, cadherins, and gap junctions as well as the relative role of
              2D and 3D environments in this cross-talk.  Insights gained will benefit design
              of bioartificial liver reactors and implantable constructs and should have a
              major technological impact on the practice of 3D tissue engineering.  

The
              educational plan focused on building and maintaining the involvement of women
              in science and engineering and the need for further integration across the
              fields of engineering, biology, and medicine.  A pilot outreach program for
              11-13 year old girls would be expanded and a study of reasons for attrition of
              women in engineering would be broadened.  An interdisciplinary undergraduate
              textbook on Tissue Engineering would be completed.
