Abstract    :
              EIA-0132707 -Harvard University-Marc D. Hauser-Primate-Inspired Specialized
              Learning in an Agent Architecture:  Safe and Robust Adaptive Action
              Selection

The intended multi-year research project would build a library of
              computational modules or idioms for representing learning and action-selection
              in non-human primates.  We will particularly focus on modeling why well-learned
              new behavior does not always over-ride more established behavior patterns, and
              under what circumstances it can come to be exploited.  This modeling could be
              key to designing fail-safe mechanisms in highly adaptive intelligent
              systems.

In this exploratory project, we would adapt an existing agent
              architecture to model the specialized learning in Cotton-Top Tamarins,
              focussing on several completed experiments already documented in our
              laboratory.  Conducting this research under an SGER will give us an estimate of
              the scale of the software project, the level of interaction we can expect
              between the modeling and our ongoing research, and the educational potential
              for this system.  This will help us determine the level of staffing and funding
              requested in the full proposal.
