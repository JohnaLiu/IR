This grant provides partial support for a state-of-the-art
              instrument that integrates optical micros-copy, confocal laser scanning
              microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and optical tweezers.  It will be housed
              in the P.I.'s laboratory at the University of Maryland, where it will be a
              primary tool for the P.I.'s research programs in geomicrobiology,
              biogeochemistry, and nanoscale sci-ence.  This instrument will be capable of
              collecting force measurements concurrent with optical observations as well as
              fluorescence resonance energy transfer.  Further, it will allow the
              simul-taneous collection of atomic force microscopy (or scanning near-field
              optical microscopy) and laser scanning microscopy images.  The applications of
              this instrument include for example: the study of fundamental intra- and
              inter-molecular forces between biomolecules on living cells and material
              surfaces (or other cells); identification of cell wall biomolecules which
              interact specifi-cally with particular minerals or cells; the study of the
              properties and localization of biomolecu-les on microbial surfaces; the study
              of mineral dissolution and growth including biomineraliza-tion; investigations
              of metal (or organic acid) sorption to mineral surfaces; the development of
              nanolithography techniques; and educational outreach.
