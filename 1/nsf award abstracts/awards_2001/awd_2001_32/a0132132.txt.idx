Abstract    :
              The Integrated Coastal Management Sustainability Education Project is designed
              to help insure that future practitioners of coastal management are well
              prepared to address the lack of sustainability of  environmental management
              processes in South-East Asia.  In order to meet this goal, the results from an
              ongoing research project which focuses on process sustainability will be
              translated into educational materials, imbedded into an ongoing distance
              learning program and disseminated to the public over the Internet.
