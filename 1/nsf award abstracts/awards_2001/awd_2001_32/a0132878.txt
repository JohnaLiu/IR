Abstract    :
              This project builds on the PI's archival fieldwork and initial analysis of
              turn-of-the-century Argentine criminology, to document its rise and application
              in state practices.  It incorporates newly available sources that connect it to
              the broader political and legal history of the nation and region. It examines
              the impact of criminological theory on law and legislation and state policies
              intended to regulate and discipline deviant behavior in the context of
              modernizing Argentina. It examines the practical application of criminological
              theories in four key areas: 
New techniques of identification in policing
The
              scientific reform of prison discipline
The impact of positivist criminology on
              national legislation in the "social defense" laws of 1902 and 1910
The
              campaign to modernize the national Criminal Code. 

Encoding the Criminal
              unites two approaches, the history of science, and Latin American history.  It
              focuses systematically on the contributions of Argentine scientists, and the
              impact of their ideas on local developments as well as on a larger body of
              international scientific thought. The project is part of an emerging field of
              historical inquiry that examines the interaction between science, politics, and
              culture. It provides new data and an important perspective not often taken into
              account in studies of science, technology and society.  The project contributes
              to broader discussions of the role of science on state policy and law. It
              illuminates public debates about the role of science in determining the causes
              and treatments of crime.
