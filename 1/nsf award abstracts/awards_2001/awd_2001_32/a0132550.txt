Abstract    :
              This grant explores high-resolution topographic imaging with concurrent optical,
              electrochemical, photoelectrochemical, and fluorescence mapping. These
              techniques are based on novel modifications of a commercial Near Field Optical
              Scanning Microscopic (NSOM Topometrix) to obtain shear force feedback control
              with a piezoelectric tuning fork. Optical resolutions of 60 nm and
              electrochemical resolutions of 50 nm have been achieved for these functional
              microscopies. This research is aimed at extending these resolutions to 10 nm or
              below. In addition a study of pitting precursor sites will be made for high
              purity titanium, titanium alloys, and aluminum alloys. This should facilitate
              in-situ and ex-situ evaluation of surface treatments used to mitigate pitting
              corrosion.

A primary goal of this work is to develop these high-resolution
              capabilities to identify precursor sites for corrosion of microelectronic and
              magnetic storage assemblies. As the dimensions of these and similar devices
              decrease, corrosion becomes increasingly important and techniques to explore
              heterogeneous surfaces are needed. Magnetic storage surfaces can be covered
              with diamond-like carbon coatings to provide tribological protection, and it is
              important to determine how well these surfaces protect against corrosion as
              well. Scanning electrochemical microscopy with concurrent topographic mapping
              is the primary technique used for the studies. A secondary goal is to employ
              these successful characterization techniques for fabrication of novel surface
              structures.
