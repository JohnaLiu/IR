Funds from this grant provide continued partial salary support
              for a technician to oversee operation and maintenance of the isotope
              geochemistry facility at the University of Rochester.  This is a Phase II
              technician support grant and follows three years of initial NSF support
              (EAR-9730743). The isotope geochemistry facility at Rochester houses four mass
              spectrometers including a thermal ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS), a
              multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS), a
              quadrapole based ICP-MS and a noble gas mass spectrometer.  These instruments
              are use by faculty members Basu, Anbar and Poreda for research projects ranging
              from studies of the petrogenesis of flood basalts to investigations of
              biological fractionation of heavy metal isotopes during mineral weathering to
              studies of cosmic dust fluxes to the surface of the earth over geologic time.
              The instruments supported by this technician will continue to provide a
              valuable research and educational tool to the University and to a number of
              collaborating geoscientists.  As the University has committed to picking up
              full time support for this position following this Phase II award, NSF support
              has aided in the creation of an university funded job in the geosciences field
              that is an alternative to traditional academic career paths.
