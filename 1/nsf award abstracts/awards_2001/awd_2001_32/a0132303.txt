Abstract    :
              The HerpNET community project will enable knowledge networking of biodiversity
              information about the world's amphibians and reptiles for science and society.
              The information store is enormous, acquired during 300 years of biological
              exploration of the earth.  Access to and use of these data are fundamental if
              we are to understand our biological diversity and its functional role in
              environmental system.  Amphibians are especially sensitive indicators of
              environmental quality and change.  The project is designed to create a network
              of distributed herpetological databases that builds on proven technologies and
              scales well.  It is also designed to be economical to implement and easily
              accessible.  HerpNET will help to form the basis on which a largely descriptive
              science can become a predictive one.  It will provide global access and sharing
              of data, data standards, installation and management software and
              documentation.
