Abstract    :
              The aim is to develop a meaningful mathematical description of translation,
              which can provide insights into the mRNA-protein expression relationship in
              Escherichia coli.  The two overarching objectives of the proposed efforts are:
              (i) the identification of the parameters that affect the correlation of mRNA
              and protein expression based on the formulation and computational analysis of
              mathematical models of the translation processes, and (ii) the quantification
              of these parameters using the information derived within the experimental
              component of the proposed work.
