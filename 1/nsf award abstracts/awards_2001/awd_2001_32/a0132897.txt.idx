Abstract    :
              This award will enable junior investigators to attend the
              school, "Electromagnetic Probes of Fundamental Physics," to be held at
              the Ettore Majorana Center in Erice, Sicily, on October 16-21, 2001.  The
              school will cover a wide variety of topics spanning, and crossing, the fields
              of nuclear and particle physics, including both quantum chromodynamics and
              quantum electrodynamics, the physics of strong fields, and the experimental
              promise of collider laboratories.
