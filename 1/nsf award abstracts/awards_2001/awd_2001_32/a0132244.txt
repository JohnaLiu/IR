This grant provides partial support for acquisition of a
              Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) for the Department of Earth Sciences at the
              University of California, Santa Cruz.  The GPR setup will include five antennas
              spanning frequencies from 12.5 MHz through 400 MHz.  The GPR equipment will be
              utilized by: (1) the UCSC Surface Processes Group (glaciology, geomorphology,
              hydrology and Quaternary geology; ~60% of time), (2) other UCSC Earth Science
              faculty (geophysics, hydrogeology, and neotectonics; ~30% of time), and (3)
              other UCSC and non-UCSC users (~10% of time).  GPR technology fits ideally into
              the Earth Science research programs listed above because it permits better
              integration of surface and near-surface observations of geologic structures and
              stratigraphy.  This GPR capability combines with its portability and ease of
              use to provide an excellent tool for constraining models of key surface and
              near-surface geologic processes even in logistically difficult environments. 
              In addition to its application in research projects, the UCSC GPR facility will
              be used to intensify hands-on training of UCSC undergraduate and graduate
              students in field geophysical techniques.  Use of this new equipment will be
              incorporated into relevant upper division courses: Geologic Hazards,
              Environmental Geophysics, Geomorphology, Soil Properties and Mechanics, and
              Groundwater.  The host department will provide support for the new GPR facility
              in the form of: (1) 30% equipment cost match, (2) computer and software
              resources for GPR data field processing and post-processing, (3) technical
              support by a team of three specialists, and (4) storage space.
