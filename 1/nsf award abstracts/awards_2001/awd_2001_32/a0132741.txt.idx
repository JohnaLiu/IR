Abstract    :
              This interagency transfer to the Office of Naval Research (ONR) supports
              ACE-Asia (Aerosol Characterization Experiment) which took place in Spring,
              2001. ACE-Asia was aimed at improving our understanding of the physical,
              chemical, and radiative properties and distribution of natural and
              anthropogenic aerosols emitted in Northeast Asia and transported over the
              Pacific Ocean. ACE was supported by NSF, ONR, NOAA, and other national and
              international agencies. Specifically, this transfer covers part of the
              deployment and operational costs for the ONR supported Twin Otter aircraft. It
              also funds satellite support for the Twin Otter and the NSF C-130 aircraft in
              the field.
