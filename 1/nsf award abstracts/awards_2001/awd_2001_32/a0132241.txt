Abstract    :
                   This NSF Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project continues
              research and development of a commercial process for the manufacture of
              mono-size-dispersed, spherical powder (size 1-10 micron) from metals melting up
              to 200C.  A unique magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) jet exciter will be designed,
              fabricated and developed as a component of the system essential to producing
              monosphere powder to high tolerances (e.g., as demanded by the electronics
              industry of ball grid arrays for surface-mount components). The electrostatic
              means, for preventing coalescence in the drop cloud, will be developed further.
              Development of cooling means for solidification will be completed. Specific
              industry quality control standards and testing will be applied to qualify the
              monosphere product. Finally, a refined analysis of cost of manufacture, and a
              complete business plan will be produced. The outcome expected from this project
              is the technology base for the commercial, large-scale production of
              monospheres. 
    This unique process innovation for large-scale production of
              monospheres, will provide a major new source of precise and economical powder
              for electronic solder balls and paste, powder metallurgy, composites,
              magnetorheological fluids, catalyst carriers, solid/fluid reactions and a
              multitude of other uses.
