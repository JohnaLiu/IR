Abstract    :
              Abstract  The tropical Andes are an epicenter of global diversity, containing
              more plant and vertebrate species and higher levels of endemism than any other
              biodiversity hotspot. Information on the distribution of species within the
              Bolivian Andes is critical for conservation priority setting and management,
              and is of general interest to the fields of taxonomy, systematics, and
              biogeography. Yet for most taxa, the Bolivian portion of this globally
              important region remains one of the most poorly surveyed segments of the entire
              Andean chain. The Center for Biodiversity and Conservation (CBC) at the
              American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), the Coleccion Boliviana de Fauna
              (CBF), and the Museo de Historia Natural Noel Kempff Mercado (MHNNKM) have
              formed a consortium to study this poorly surveyed region. The consortium has
              developed plans for a series of multi-taxa surveys across elevational gradients
              in two Andean protected areas that the Bolivian government has identified as
              critical management challenges: Parque Nacional and Area de Manejo Integrado
              Cotapata and Parque Nacional and Area de Manejo Integrado Amboro. Birds, fish,
              herpetofauna, and invertebrates will be sampled simultaneously using
              standardized collection methods along an elevational gradient of over 3000
              meters. Large biotic survey projects are increasingly recognized as
              cost-effective means to making significant progress in understanding the
              biogeography and systematics of a variety of taxa. But surveys of this
              magnitude require extensive logistical and methodological considerations. In
              preparation for this major initiative, a pilot survey at a single site in
              Parque Nacional and Area de Manejo Integrado Amboro, Bolivia, will be conducted
              to initiate the consortium's field activities and finalize protocols for future
              surveys. Goals for the proposed pilot survey are to: 1) Quantify the amount of
              time and sampling effort necessary either to reach an asymptote in species
              encounter rates or to statistically estimate the true species richness at a
              site. 2) Evaluate the feasibility of barcoding and tracking specimens from the
              time of their collection at remote field sites, through the preparation and
              identification phases, to their accession into museum collections. 3) Fully
              standardize invertebrate sampling methods. 4) Send a small team to visit each
              of the additional proposed study sites in Amoboro and Cotapata in order to
              efficiently coordinate future visits. The development of a suite of
              standardized biodiversity survey techniques and quantifying the sampling effort
              needed to adequately assess species richness or endemism has the potential to
              make biodiversity surveys more efficient and extend their application to wider
              areas. The use of microbarcode and databasing technologies is already leading
              to enormous efficiencies in biodiversity surveys and collection management,
              particularly for invertebrates. By developing and implementing field-based
              protocols for using these technologies, this study will help expand the
              application of these digital advances to field surveys. The results of this
              pilot expedition will help streamline the design and execution of multi-taxa
              surveys in Andean regions, and will in particular inform the design of the
              proposed series of surveys in Bolivia.
