The objective
              of this SGER proposal is to study steady streaming flows due to oscillating
              bluff bodies of complex shape in highly confined fluid geometries.  It is
              hypothesized that fish determine the direction of incident sound by exploiting
              such flows in their inner ears.  If proved to be correct, this "auditory
              retina" hypothesis could lead to a new paradigm in sensory biology with
              possible application in human hearing.  In engineering practice, this
              hypothesis could lead to compact and sensitive underwater acoustic transducers.
