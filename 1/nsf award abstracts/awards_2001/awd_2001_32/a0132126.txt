Abstract    :
                  This Small Business Innovation Research  Phase II project seeks to develop a
              compact, lightweight, and low cost Microlith Water Gas Shift (WGS) reactor
              capable of rapid start-up, excellent transient response and high CO conversion
              efficiency with very low levels of methane formation. This technology offers a
              key low cost contribution to meeting   objectives for efficiency and clean
              emissions. The  Microlith based WGS reactor will be optimized by developing
              prototype reactor designs for fuel processor applications, and demonstrating
              predicted durability of up to 5000 hours.
     Target customers and markets
              are fuel processor/fuel cell manufacturers developing and seeking to sell
              Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell products for stationary residential
              and distributed power, and for heavy duty vehicles in the short term, fuel
              processor/fuel cell manufacturers developing products for automotive markets in
              the long term and opportunistically, specialty chemical reactor applications
              (e.g. for hydrogen and syngas production and in ammonia synthesis) where the
              technology's size and performance.
