Abstract    :
              This project proposes workshop, to be conducted in June 2002 on "Managing as
              Designing" to undertake a high-risk effort to create a new approach to
              management education. Design thinking as a powerful way of approaching problems
              is the underlying philosophy, in contrast to the prevailing emphasis on purely
              analytical skills in decision-making characterizing management education since
              the 1960's. Design represents a distinct mode of cognition different from
              analytical decision making, and suggests a more creative approach especially to
              the problem of envisioning new futures. The objective of the workshop is to
              define a new vocabulary of management education based on design thinking. The
              workshop will engage a broad range of scholars, designers and managers
              representing disciplines including architecture, music, art, sociology,
              history, communication and management
