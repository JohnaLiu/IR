Abstract    :
              This is a SGER project to explore the possibility of remote sensing of large
              strain gauge arrays, which may be  embedded in  building walls and bridges,
              for continuous or on-demand monitoring of the structure's
              health condition.       The power handling capabilities of a chip consisting
              of active analog vlsi transistorized bridge circuits, which determines the
              state of the strain gauge will be investigated,  Initially the commercially
              available gauge products will be used as an arm in the active bridge that will
              be sent to mosis for fabrication into a  vlsi chip.  The attenuation
              characteristics of structural materials such as reinforced concrete are also to
              be determaned as well ass a means of transmitting data into and out of the
              embedded bridge.  As a preliminary proof of concept the remote system will be
              mounted on the exterior of a wall whereas longer range studies will
              incorporate it embedded inside of walls.
