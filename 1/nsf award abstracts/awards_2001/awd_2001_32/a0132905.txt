Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to develop a general synthesis of chiral
              oxazolines, which can be applied to the discovery of enantioselective olefin
              epoxidation catalysts using molecular oxygen as a terminal oxidant.  Further, a
              general synthesis of chiral pyridine ligands for application to an asymmetric
              allylic displacement will be sought.  The educational focus of the project is
              to incorporate, into the curriculum,  the relationship of current applications
              in synthetic organic chemistry to the fundamentals physical organic
              chemistry.

With this CAREER proposal, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program is supporting the research and teaching efforts of Dr.
              Matthew Sigman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah. 
              Professor Sigman will focus his work on developing new chiral ligands for
              applications in asymmetric synthesis.  The ligands will be assembled in a
              systematic manner in order to allow for optimization and direct insight into
              reaction mechanisms.  This type of methodology development presents
              opportunities for the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.  Dr. Sigman's
              educational activities will be focused on improving the organic chemistry
              curriculum.
