Abstract    :
              This proposal is for a Digital Society and Technologies Program workshop on
              "Global Issues in the Social and Economic Impacts of IT" to be conducted
              jointly with the European Commission's Information Society Technology program
              in conjunction with their research conference "e2001: e-Business and e-Work" to
              be held in Venice, Italy, October 17-19. The proposed workshop will be held on
              October 16, in advance of the conference. The workshop will explore a research
              agenda regarding the global social and economic impacts of IT and the
              possibilities for international cooperation in gathering multi-country data and
              conducting research. The workshop will discuss research issues related to 1)
              the global diffusion of IT production and use, the globalization of e-commerce
              (including mobile e-commerce), the new ways of working and collaboration, and
              the influence of national environments and government policies on IT diffusion
              and impact. A report will be produced indicating the results from the workshop.
