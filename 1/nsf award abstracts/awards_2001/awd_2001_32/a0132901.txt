Computational geometry
              is the branch of theoretical computer science devoted to the design,
analysis,
              and implementation of geometric algorithms and data structures.
              Computational
geometry has deep roots in reality: Geometric problems arise
              naturally in any computa-
tional field that simulates or interacts with the
              physical world|computer graphics, robotics,
geographic information systems,
              computer aided-design, and molecular modeling, to name
a few|as well as in
              more abstract domains such as combinatorial geometry and algebraic
topology.
              Aside from their obvious practical significance, geometric algorithms and
              data
structures enjoy a rich and satisfying mathematical structure, and their
              development often
requires tools from mathematical disciplines such as
              combinatorics, topology, and algebraic
geometry, as well as traditional
              computational tools.
The proposal outlines a challenging career development
              plan focusing on research in a
broad cross-section of computational geometry,
              building on and significantly broadening the
PI's successful work in the field
              over the last several years. Specific problem areas in which
the PI plans to
              work include approximation algorithms, kinetic data structures, spatial
              and
temporal databases, external memory computation, geometric optimization,
              and clustering.
This classification is at best a rough guide, as many
              interesting geometric problems fall
into more than one category. Furthermore,
              the PI plans to continue combining theory and
empirical experimentation in his
              work, putting an emphasize on algorithms that perform
well in practice.
