Abstract    :
              This project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the
              Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, supports a three-day workshop for about
              twenty graduate students and postdoctoral students that aims to prepare them to
              initiate careers at the college and university level.  Professor Jespersen from
              Saint John's University and faculty from diverse institutions will host this
              workshop at the Fall 2001 Eastern Analytical Symposium meeting in New Jersey. 
              Similar workshops will be offered in 2002 and 2003 with the goal of
              establishing the workshop as a traditional, self-sustaining component of the
              Eastern Analytical Symposium.  The objective of this project is to make future
              college and  university teachers more fully aware of the opportunities and
              responsibilities that will accompany this career choice so that they will be
              more successful. Of particular interest will be attracting women and minorities
              to academic careers and increasing their retention rates in the teaching
              profession.
