Abstract    :
              This proposal will support two workshops between Chinese and US researchers in
              the digital library area, to work towards a major international collaboration
              in the creation of a very large digital book collection.  The workshops will
              provide coordination in scanning technology, the choice of materials to be
              scanned, the organization of the delivery of the material to be scanned, and
              the disposition of the resulting digital content.
