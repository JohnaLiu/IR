Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will develop a program
              that will optimize poly (ethynyl) silazanes (PESZ) synthesis with an emphasis
              on improved efficiency and low production costs; will scale-up the production
              of PESZ polymers to pilot scale batch sizes; will optimize PESZ processing for
              component fabrication; will fabricate "real world" components, such as thrust
              deflectors and diesel engine particulate filters; and will obtain "real world"
              mechanical and performance testing data.  Through the course of achieving these
              objectives, commercial opportunities will be pursued. This approach potentially
              permits the fabrication of extremely large ceramic matrix composites (CMCs)
              structures never before possible in much the same manner as large polymer
              matrix aircraft structures and boat hulls are currently manufactured.

The
              commercial application will be the fabrication of extremely large CMC
              structures that can be used in the aircraft industry.
