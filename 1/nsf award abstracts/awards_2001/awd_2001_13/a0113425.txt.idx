Abstract    :
              Internet is undergoing an overhaul unprecedented in size, diversity, and reach,
              with profound im- pact in all aspects of our scientific, social, economic and
              political life through the integration of networks of communication,
              transportation, entertainment, utilities, and finance. The stability and
              robustness of this vital infrastructure demands a rigorous theory to understand
              the current protocols and evolve them to meet emerging challenges. We propose
              to develop such a theory for TCP congestion control, and use it to drastically
              improve the stability, robustness and optimality of the current protocols. A
              key insight is to view congestion control as a distributed asynchronous
              computation to maxi- mize aggregate source utility over the Internet;
              different TCP and active queue management (AQM) schemes correspond to
              different utility functions and different algorithms to maximize them. Our
              research hastwo components. First, we will develop a new theoretical model of
              TCP congestion control based on duality in optimization and multivariate
              robust control. The theory will clarify the role of source algorithms, such as
              Tahoe, Reno and Vegas, and active queue management, such as DropTail, RED and
              REM, in the control of networks and establish performance limits of the
              current protocols; it will explain the effect on stability when delay,
              topology, capacity, and load scale up; and it will provide conditions under
              which the feedback stability ofTCP/AQM algorithms are invariant to these
              effects. Indeed, such a theory is already emerging from our recent works. Even
              in its currently preliminary stage, it already provides a fundamental
              understanding on some widely observed performance and fairness behavior of the
              current protocols, and uncovers new and surprising stability problems. For
              example, it shows that the current protocols become unstable and exhibit
              bifurcation when network capacity increases. Moreover, maintaining stability as
              capacity scales up arbitrarily imposes severe constraints on how sources
              adjust their rates (TCP) and what congestion information is fed back (AQM).
              The current protocol does not satisfy the condition for such stability
              invariance, and hence may be ill suited for future networks where, pulled
              by application demand and pushed by technological advances, the capacity will
              be large. The second component of our research is the design of practical TCP
              and AQM protocols based on the theory, and the development of prototypes and
              experiments to demonstrate their effectiveness. We will use the theory to
              identify the sources of instability in the current protocols when delay,
              network size, capacity, and traffic load scale up. We will design both
              enhancements that incrementally evolve the current protocols, and drastically
              new protocols that have the strongly robust stability property promised by
              theory. As a concrete application of our algorithms, we will apply them to
              improve TCP performance over wireless links, both because they are ubiquitous
              and because they are likely to remain the most important bottlenecks in future
              networks.
