Abstract    :
              
We are developing and implementing an undergraduate Computer Security track at
              the Department of Computer and Information Sciences of Towson University. We
              are developing this track in close collaboration with our consultants and
              evaluators from industry and academia and are disseminating the results at
              conferences and at a forum for representatives from industry, government and
              academia, organized at the conclusion of this project.

Seven courses are the
              key components of this track: Computer Ethics, Introduction to Computer
              Security, Introduction to Cryptography, Network Security, Database Security,
              Operating Systems Security and Security Seminar. The first two courses exist.
              The network security course and a portion of the Operating Systems Security
              course are being adapted from courses at the University of Idaho, which was
              designated as one of the Centers of Excellence in Information Assurance. The
              principal investigators are developing the remaining courses. Students
              graduating in this track have a strong background in the foundations of
              computer security and their applications and are better prepared to join the
              21st century workforce.
