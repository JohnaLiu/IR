Abstract    :
              The technical focus of this project is to develop a unified approach for the
              design of low-cost batch fabricated adaptive radio frequency (RF) transceiver
              frontends with a goal of achieving robust, high speed and low power wireless
              communications.  These adaptive RF frontends are suitable for either high
              mobility radio channels or environments with variable fading conditions, such
              as microwave and millimeter-wave local area networks where movements of
              personnel and objects can vary a channels' attenuation and fading
              characteristics. 

The proposed research is an interdisciplinary effort in
              material science and electrical engineering that encompasses the development
              and characterization of adaptive RF frontends, consisting of frequency and
              polarization agile antenna arrays, electronically tunable delay lines, matching
              circuits and filters all incorporating thin film barium strontium titanate
              (BST).  BST technology provides many advantages over conventional devices
              because of its miniaturization and integration features.  This research
              investigates the development and characterization of a broad range of RF
              devices and components for the design of low cost smart transceivers, which
              entails physical and RF design, layout, simulation, fabrication and
              testing.
