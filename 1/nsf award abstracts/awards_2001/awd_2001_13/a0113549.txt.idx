Abstract    :
              This program provides an opportunity for faculty from other universities to
              receive education in information assurance with the focus on being able to
              teach the core concepts to their students. The target audience is faculty
              members from 4 year colleges and universities who are teaching computer
              science, information systems, or related fields and have a working knowledge of
              computers. They participate in a summer workshop to help them integrate the
              material into their courses or to help them develop new courses. Participating
              faculty take two courses offered via distance education. They also receive
              support material to help them integrate the subject material into their
              existing courses. The delivery consists of video taped lectures and on-line
              support through chat-rooms, emails, and phone. Several of the courses offer a
              hands-on learning experience where the faculty perform experiments and use
              software systems remotely through the Internet.
