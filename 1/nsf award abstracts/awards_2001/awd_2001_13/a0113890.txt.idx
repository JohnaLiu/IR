               ABSTRACT   Proposal: CMS-0113890 PI: Julio C. Martinez Institution:
              Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Date: June 21,
              2001   ABSTRACT CMS0113890 " ITR/AP: Information Technology for Enabling
              Dynamic Immersive and Interactive Visualization of Construction
              Operations."  Construction operations are spatially and temporally complex
              and dynamic. Virtual dynamic environments that allow immersion in such
              operations are invaluable for understanding, and improving. In the case of
              operations that have been modeled using discrete-event simulation, virtual
              immersive environments promise significant improvements in their verification
              and validation, and are essential for their credibility and subsequent use in
              decision-making. A proper virtual environment of a construction operation must
              show, in addition to the evolving facility being built, the movements and
              transformations of the people, machines, and materials that carry out
              construction in a spatially and temporally accurate manner. While most of the
              dynamics in these environments are continuous in nature, they must be recreated
              from discrete and unevenly spaced chunks of information. In addition, this
              information must be simple and succinct so that it can be generated by end-user
              programmable operations planning tools such as discrete-event simulation
              languages. In order to allow the creation of these virtual and dynamic
              environments, this research will lead to the design of a spatially and
              temporally accurate straight-line animation language, and implementation of
              this language in a wide variety of hardware platforms. Success in the design
              and implementation of this language is necessary to enable environments that,
              in addition to being dynamic and immersive, are interactive. In these
              environments, objects under the control of simulation models will be aware of,
              and react to, humans and human controlled machines. The impacts to learning,
              operator training, and operations design will likely be significant. Benefits
              extend beyond construction into other fields such as transportation (especially
              aviation), shipbuilding, aerospace, manufacturing, and the service industries,
              wherein the necessity to effectively communicate simulations is as acute as in
              construction.
