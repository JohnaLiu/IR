Abstract    :
              The tremendous diversity of life on the planet is mirrored by the diversity of
              web-based information about species.  This information is often difficult to
              find and unfriendly to use.  Web pages that are useful to scientists are often
              inaccessible to schoolchildren, and education pages usually hold no research
              interest.  Unlike the parts in a well-stocked building supply warehouse, the
              databases and web pages about organisms are difficult to locate and combine
              into coherent structure.  This project uses a component architecture to
              integrate biodiversity web information seamlessly.  It introduces building
              blocks to locate the origin and authority of a species name, to extract maps
              for species distribution, and provides nuts and bolts by which unrelated
              databases and web site can be made to cooperate.  This is achieved through
              using XML, the eXtensible Markup Language that has been used in solving
              comparable problem in other parts of the web.  The project develops XML
              gateways to make flexible the data sources not able to produce XML and provides
              multiple views on the same data.  This accommodates different purposes,
              educational background and ages, for example.  To illustrate its broad
              utility, the framework will be provided to a group of school teachers working
              with biology undergraduates and graduate students to produce a web-accessible
              field guide to the habitats of Columbia Point, Boston, together with curricular
              material for classroom use.
