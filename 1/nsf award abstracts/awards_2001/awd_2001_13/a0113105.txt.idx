Abstract    :
              The phenomenal growth of the World Wide Web has resulted in the emergence and
              popularity of several new information technology related
              computer applications. The emerging computer workloads involve the
              integration of a variety of software, protocols, and standards: GUIs, Java,
              CORBA,  cgi, perl, TCP/IP, HTTP,  and HTML  are  just a few of them.
              Facilitating smooth use of the internet for emerging applications involves
              designing efficient computer systems and microprocessors for use in the
              computers that serve these applications.  Most of these workloads are just
              emerging, and their behavior is not well-understood by computer designers
              and architects. Many of the microprocessors that run these applications
              were designed before the advent of these workloads.  The proposed research
              consists of understanding emerging workloads of the Information Technology era
              and designing microprocessors and computer systems for their efficient
              execution. It involves identifying where the cycles are gone during execution
              of these workloads, and identifying sources of  loss of performance. The study
              will pin point bottlenecks, and identify architectural enhancements to improve
              performance. The performance monitoring counters present on commercial
              processors will be used for the first level of characterization followed by
              detailed complete system simulations for analyzing design tradeoffs. The
              proposed research will be conducted in close collaboration with our industrial
              partners, IBM, Tivoli, Intel and AMD.  The project will serve as an integral
              part of a long term, comprehensive research program to influence the design
              of microprocessors and computer systems for the information technology era.
