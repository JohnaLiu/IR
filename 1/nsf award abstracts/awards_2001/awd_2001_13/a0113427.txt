Abstract    :
              This project will use computer shape matching algorithms to assemble the
              remaining fragments of the Forma Urbis Romae, a giant marble map of ancient
              Rome.  The original, measuring 60 feet wide by 45 feet high, dates to the
              second century AD.  The map now consists of 1,163 fragments, and is incomplete.
               Piecing the remaining fragments together is a unique challenge for computer
              graphics research.  If successful, it will offer to archeologists a resource of
              great importance.  In order to test the graphics algorithms the raw data was
              acquired at great cost and effort.  A team of faculty and students from
              Stanford spent a month on site digitizing the shape and surface appearance of
              every known fragment using laser scanning and digital color photography.  The
              processed raw data now consists of 8 billion polygons and 6 thousand color
              images, amounting to 40GB of data. The project hopes to produce and disseminate
              a database of 3D models and photographs of this famous archaeological document
              and in the process, contribute new algorithms for shape matching for objects of
              kind.
