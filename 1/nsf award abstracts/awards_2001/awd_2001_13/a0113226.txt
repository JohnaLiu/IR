Abstract    :
              The aims of the project are to develop implementation architectures and
              conceptual foundations for SYNCHRONIZERS -- programs that reconcile copies of
              replicated data after disconnected updates. More specifically, the project's
              goals are (1) to develop high-level SPECIFICATIONS for various forms of
              synchronization, in particular for the domains of file system synchronization
              and synchronization for more general structured data presented as XML; and (2)
              to build and distribute IMPLEMENTATIONS embodying these specifications. These
              activities are tightly connected, and will proceed in parallel throughout the
              project's lifetime. The results of the research will both be disseminated in
              the form conference and journal publications and embodied in publically
              distributed software. The long-term intention is both to advance the conceptual
              foundations of synchronization tasks (in filesystems, databases, ad hoc network
              protocols, and cooperative middleware layers) and, by offering clean designs
              and compelling prototypes, to improve engineering practice in the area.
