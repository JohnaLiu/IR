Abstract    :
              The objective of this ITR-small award is to develop a prototype for a unified
              computational framework able to provide an effective expansion to global
              coverage of any regional model based on the grid-point method. This
              'Globalization Framework' will be augmented by a capability for local
              enhancement of resolution over selected areas of interest and the movement of
              the better-resolved domains over the globe. The globalization will be achieved
              through application of a class of quasi-uniform spherical grids, that avoids
              the well-known problem of over-resolving of the polar regions typical for the
              standard longitude-latitude mesh. The technique of grid overlapping will be
              used for local enhancement of resolution. The regional model used at  National
              Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the eta model, will be used as a
              prototype for the project. The framework will be developed for a combined use
              on a workstation (in the pre- and post-processing stage) using an
              object-oriented paradigm, and on a mainframe distributed memory computer (in
              the execution stage). For the benefit of the broader community, the
              pre/post-processing stage will also be tested and adjusted to the Linux
              environment, and the execution stage to a cluster of PCs. The work is important
              because it is a novel application of a numerical technique that will offer new
              insights into regional climate studies.
