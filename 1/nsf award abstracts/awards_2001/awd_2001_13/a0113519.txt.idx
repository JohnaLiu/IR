Abstract    :
               EIA-0113519 Dawn J. Wright Oregon State University  Title: ITR/IM:
              Infrastructure for Data Sharing, Spatial Analysis, Resource Decision-Making,
              and Societal Impact  The goal of this project is to address the problems of
              the public resource manager in making effective use of discipline-specific data
              within the inherently interdisciplinary context of the coastal zone. Initially
              the focus will be on local users on the Oregon Coast. However, there is great
              potential that the technologies can serve as a general model for similar
              efforts throughout North America, by developing an interactive,
              Internet-accessible information management system that incorporates a variety
              of geospatial data and analysis tools within a common framework. End-user
              training and direct technical assistance are incorporated into the development
              of this system, as are back-end system maintenance tools to ensure system
              longevity. This will enable coastal decision-makers at all government levels,
              the public, and research scientists to more easily find and use relevant,
              timely geospatial information. In this way universal participation in coastal
              decision making among coastal communities can be improved by extending
              community-expanding infrastructure to public offices that would otherwise face
              difficulties accessing IT services and resources.  Specifically, a web-based
              data sharing depot will be built, with integrated Internet mapping and tool
              building capabilities to provide the coordination that resource managers and
              scientists need to tackle the interdisciplinary topic-based issues
              characteristic of the coastal zone. The infrastructure will be designed so that
              it is scalable over time both in size and in audience and encouraging of 2-way
              contributions by more advanced participant users. Much of this infrastructure
              will be generic, of use to many areas of interdisciplinary research in the
              natural sciences. The infrastructure, called the Oregon Coastal Atlas (OCA)
              will include: 1. A web-based electronic repository that will hold not only
              physical observations (traditional data),text, video and graphics, but also
              information about computational elements (programs, models, tools, and scripts
              for computational processing); 2. A set of tools that facilitate the entry of
              new data and metadata as well as the transformation between supported formats;
              and  3. A new form of XML, called Coastal XML or CML, that will improve the
              exportability of data archive structures and tools.
