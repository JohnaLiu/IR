Abstract    :
               The project uses modeling techniques originally developed in physics to
              understand the growth of business firms.  Physicists have analyzed systems in
              which the behavior of one "unit" (an atom, perhaps) is affected by the behavior
              of a large number of other units.  The effect of each individual interaction
              may be small, but the aggregate effect is not.  By analogy, the growth of each
              business firm is affected by a large number of other firms: competitors,
              customers, suppliers, and the producers of related products.  In 1939, Coase
              published a seminal article in which he argued that firms exist to minimize
              transaction costs.  This article provided the framework that economists still
              use to try to understand the size and growth of firms.  Even though the logic
              of this framework is widely accepted, it has not yielded testable predictions
              about the size and growth of individual firms that have been verified
              empirically.  In other words, it has not passed the fundamental test of a
              successful scientific theory.  The results in models of physical systems with
              large numbers of interacting units are that while the behavior of any one unit
              is inherently unpredictable, the statistical properties of the entire system
              are predictable.  This project develops models that are consistent with the
              framework suggested by Coase, that explain well-documented regularities about
              the distribution of firm size and growth, and that explain why the growth,
              size, and composition of individual firms are inherently unpredictable.  While
              this project is basic research, the results could ultimately affect antitrust
              and other aspects of industrial policy.
