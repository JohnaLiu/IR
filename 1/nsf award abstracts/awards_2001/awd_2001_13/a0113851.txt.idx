Abstract    :
              This project will produce a fundamentally new computational model of light
              scattering from surfaces with multiple heterogeneous layers (such as human skin
              and inkjet prints). The new model will remove common assumptions in current
              methods, including ignoring the roughness of the layer interfaces and
              simplifying the directional characteristics of the scattered light. Such an
              accurate, general model can be used in predictive simulation, a branch of
              information technology that already plays an important role in fields such as
              color science, electronic chip manufacturing, aerospace engineering, and
              automotive engineering. The project will extend predictive simulation to many
              new applications, including the development and testing of printing
              technologies, photographic image capture, medical diagnosis, remote sensing,
              and display devices.  The project will combine theoretical and experimental
              approaches to provide a robust, efficient computer implementation of the new
              model. It will: - Construct an integrated array of high-quality digital
              cameras - Produce calibrated, complete measurements of the reflectance of
              printed flat samples and living human skin - Use powerful analytic and
              numerical tools to devise theoretical models of the scattering within the
              surfaces    measured  - Carefully implement a robust, accurate, efficient
              computational scattering model
