Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is the isolation of individual elementary reactions
              relevant to the sulfur/nitrogen interaction in combustion systems and the
              characterization of their reaction kinetics over a wide range of temperature. 
              Short-lived reactive species including atoms of nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and
              sulfur and diatomic radicals such as NH, NH2, CN, SO, CS, and SH are generated
              by pulsed ultraviolet excimer-laser or flash-lamp photolysis of precursor
              molecules.  The concentration of transient radical species are monitored with
              time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy - laser-induced fluorescence for
              molecular radicals and vacuum-ultraviolet resonance fluorescence for atomic
              species - to obtain rate constants and product identification as functions of
              temperature and pressure.  Reactions are studied under pseudo-first-order
              conditions with a large excess of the stable reactant.  Experiments include
              reactions of radicals with stable molecules such as hydrogen sulfide, sulfur
              dioxide, and nitric oxide and also radical-radical reactions involving SO. The
              interaction of nitrogen and sulfur chemistry within flames and exhaust gases
              influences the generation of nitrogen oxides from combustion and thusly impacts
              acid rain, photochemical smog, and tropospheric ozone.  Depending on
              conditions, sulfur may augment or reduce the amounts of nitrogen oxides
              emitted.  This study investigates the underlying chemistry of this
              interaction. This project provides a vehicle for the participation of
              undergraduate and secondary-school students through the Texas Academy of Math
              and Science and the Upward Bound Math and Science Program.
