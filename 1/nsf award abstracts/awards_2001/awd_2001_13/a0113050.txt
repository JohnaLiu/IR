This project deals with the very challenging problem of the
              generation of the Earth's magnetic field.  The P.I.s will adopt a dual strategy
              in which the computer hardware and software are each specifically designed to
              function together at peak efficiency.  In particular, the hardware will consist
              of a 144 processor Beowulf PC-cluster, yielding an estimated peak sustained
              performance of 100 Gflops - competitive with high-performance National
              Supercomputer Center machines, but at a fraction of the cost.  To take full
              advantage of such a cluster, the software under consideration must be easily
              and efficiently parallelizable.  The P.I. will derive the software from a
              finite element mantle convection code that is already fully parallelized, and
              already runs at high parallel efficiency on precisely such Beowulf clusters. 
              Much of the conversion from mantle to core convection has already been done,
              with no loss in parallel efficiency.
