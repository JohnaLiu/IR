Abstract    :
              Project geologists, paleontologists, and anthropologists will use geological
              field observations and newly collected fossils to characterize the dietary
              resources and habitats that were available to early human ancestors along an
              ancient tropical coast in Java.  The field area is a 20km2 outcrop of marine
              deltaic deposits where the Perning/Mojokerto Homo erectus skull cap was
              discovered in 1936. The hominid deposits are made up of material erupted from
              nearby volcanoes, and volcanic products from the beds have been dated by
              radioisotopic methods at 1.81 +/- 0.04 Ma.  New radioisotopic dates will be
              obtained in this project to more fully document the age of the hominid-bearing
              section, but the Perning hominid is already certain to be the oldest known from
              marine coast sediments.  Determining the diets of fossil hominids is one of
              the primary ways that we track the biological and behavioral adaptations lying
              at the core of human evolution.  Because of the great age of the Perning
              hominid beds, this project addresses diets at a pivotal point in human
              development when expansion of early Homo across the Old World doubtlessly
              introduced our ancestors to habitats and food resources unknown in the
              continental interior of Africa.  Considerable information now exists on the
              conditions in which early Homo lived in Africa, and from Asia evidence is
              mounting for hominid expansion nearly two million years ago.  However, the
              ecology and behavioral changes associated with the dispersal cannot be fully
              understood until there are new paleoenvironmental data from well-dated Asian
              sites.  Java is among the most valuable places in Asia for information of this
              kind, since Homo erectus may have inhabited Javan rainforests and seacoasts for
              1.8 million years.    Paleoenvironmental reconstruction of the ancient
              Perning delta will be based upon pollen-, mollusk-, and vertebrate-fossils, as
              well as detailed observations of sedimentary facies.  Comparing the
              paleoenvironmental results from Perning to those from contemporaneous hominid
              localities in Asia and Africa is expected to provide new insights into the
              behavioral patterns involved in the expansion of early Homo across the Old
              World. The geological observations and fossils collected in the project will be
              used, for example, to determine whether the ancient coast at Perning offered
              forest/shoreline dietary resources similar to those in modern Indonesia, or was
              somehow like the savannas/woodlands in which the ancient hominids of Africa and
              Eurasia lived.  If the field program leads to new hominid discoveries, they
              will likely afford opportunities to radiometrically date some of Asia's
              earliest human inhabitants, and link them to specific coastal paleohabitats. 
              New hominid fossils will also provide much needed information on the physical
              attributes of earliest Asians.
