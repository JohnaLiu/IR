Abstract    :
              0113563 McKeegan  This award provides funding for the operation, maintenance,
              and further technical development of the high- transmission, high-resolution
              ion microprobe system housed in the W. M. Keck Geochemistry Laboratory at the
              University of California in Los Angeles.  The UCLA laboratory will be managed
              as a multi-user facility providing access by U.S. researchers to the special
              capabilities (combined mass resolution, spatial resolution, and sensitivity) of
              the ion microprobe for isotopic and elemental analysis. ***
