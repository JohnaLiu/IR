Title:
              Biomolecular Computing by DNA/Enzyme Systems

Dr. Erik Winfree and Dr. Hideo
              Mabuchi are working together to develop techniques and instruments for
              high-precision quantitative analysis of the DNA molecular devices. These are
              being designed, characterized and optimized to investigate issues such as
              robustness and error-tolerance of these DNA molecular devices. The technical
              objectives being achieved in this project are: development of spFRET instrument
              capable of counting individual photons from single molecules; characterization
              of conformal states, kinetics, and thermodynamics of DNA switches;
              characterization of the activities of two enzymes, RNAP and RNase, on the DNA
              switches; development of stochastic models of in vitro transcriptional
              circuits; and investigation of robust algorithms and error-control for
              transcriptional circuits.

Through this project, the PIs are establishing a
              set of experimental systems and techniques for exploring computation by
              biological molecules.  This will provide fundamental knowledge and principles
              for nanoscale computation, such as models of computation, molecular algorithms,
              physical limits, sources of error and error correction strategies.  Thus the
              aim is to leverage the advanced control over biochemical systems to begin
              establishing a broader foundation for reliable molecular computing.
