Abstract    :
              This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program and the Major
              Research Instrumentation program supports California Polytechnic State
              University with the acquisition of a scanning electron microscope with electron
              backscatter diffraction capabilities. The research that will utilize the
              equipment spans the disciplines of soil science, tribology, biomaterials, thin
              film science, metal-joining technology and the development of intermetallic
              alloys. The instrument will be used in undergraduate and Master's-level
              -science and engineering research and education programs. The goal is to expand
              the research opportunities for undergraduates, enhance the current courses and
              laboratories, seed a greater awareness of the benefits of materials research
              within industry and expand the opportunities for professional development of
              the faculty.  This will be accomplished using four mechanisms: (1)
              Well-structured, yearlong research teams that target involving 50% females and
              50% males; (2) Short-term industry-related projects aimed at promoting research
              for "real-world" challenges; (3) Senior-level and Master's-level research
              projects based on individual faculty research interests; and (4) Laboratory
              experiments incorporated into the curriculum for the purpose of educating the
              students on the use of an increasingly important materials characterization
              tool.   This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program
              and the Major Research Instrumentation program supports California Polytechnic
              State University with the acquisition of a scanning electron microscope with
              electron backscatter diffraction capabilities. The research that will utilize
              the equipment spans the disciplines of soil science, tribology, biomaterials,
              thin film science, metal-joining technology and the development of
              intermetallic alloys. The instrument will be used in undergraduate and
              Master's-level -science and engineering research and education programs. The
              goal is to expand the research opportunities for undergraduates, enhance the
              current courses and laboratories, seed a greater awareness of the benefits of
              materials research within industry and expand the opportunities for
              professional development of the faculty.
