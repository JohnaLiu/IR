Abstract    :
              This project relieves the shortage of qualified information assurance personnel
              by providing generous financial support for at least 23 masters level students
              in the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Information Assurance Educational
              program. Several interdisciplinary degrees are offered in the program that
              allow students to specialize in their particular interest area within the
              field. There are a growing number of Information Assurance and Computer
              Security faculty and researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, and the
              students have outstanding opportunities to work in world-class on-campus
              entities such as the Software Engineering Institute and the CERT Coordination
              Center. Through classroom instruction, project work, and supplemental
              curricular activities such as an Information Technology lecture series, the
              student participants become leaders in the information security area.

The
              university is also focused on the development and success of other programs in
              this area. To that end, Carnegie Mellon University plans to host an annual
              intensive seminar for current and/or prospective CAE/IAE institution faculty.
              The seminars will consist of a three-day instructional dialog offering
              approximately 30 faculty members access to existing CAE/IAE program curricula
              and methodologies.
