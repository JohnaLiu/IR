ITR/PE(CISE):
              Tutoring Explanation and Discovery Learning: Achieving Deep Understanding
              through Tutorial Dialog

This multidisciplinary research project will develop
              new instructional software, which will be evaluated in actual classrooms.  The
              project will yield research advances in computer science, education, and
              cognitive psychology.  With respect to education, the project will develop and
              test new methods of instruction, namely, "tutoring at the explanation level". 
              These methods aim to achieve deeper student understanding, resulting in better
              memory (retention) of the acquired knowledge, as well as the ability to apply
              what was learned to unfamiliar problems (transfer).  With respect to computer
              science, this project will advance the state-of-the-art in intelligent tutoring
              systems through the incorporation of natural language processing techniques for
              assessing student explanations and improving them through dialog.  With respect
              to cognitive psychology, this project will create and test cognitive models of
              how student understanding emerges from an integration of explicit-verbal and
              implicit-perceptual learning processes.
