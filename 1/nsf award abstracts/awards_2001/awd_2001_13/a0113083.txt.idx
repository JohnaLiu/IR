Abstract    :
              Geophysical data sets are typically very large.  For example, an operational
              weather radar can generate almost 0.9 terabyte of data per year.  Developing
              continental-scale, multiyear data sets can become a major and potentially very
              costly undertaking.  Similar statements are true for geophysical satellite
              data.  Advances in information technology, particularly rapid increases in
              disk storage capacity alleviate some data access problems, but accentuate
              others.  It may be possible to get a terabyte of geophysical data online but
              visualizing and analyzing the data in their native/distribution format remains
              extremely difficult.  Approaches such as data compression or using derived
              products sometimes work, but are simplistic and ultimately counterproductive. 
              The problem is clearly multifaceted, but the focus of this project is on
              researching and developing methods for dealing with the data after distribution
              to the user.  Specifically the Principal Investigator will develop a
              client-server architecture that hides the complexities of the data set
              management from the user.  A major component is a data query language or DQL
              for manipulating a data set.  Through DQL a user can easily and efficiently
              add, delete, or modify, subsets of a data set, and rapidly search for subsets
              that match certain criteria.  The DQL client-server includes resource
              management so that a user may control the impact of an analysis on the client
              CPU, network utilization, and other computing resources.  Part of the project
              is the completion of a multiyear, multisite data set of weather radar data. 
              This will serve as a test bed for the research and will have tremendous
              intrinsic value for many other future research efforts.  When technology and
              data become available to users other than the original audience, they often
              find exciting applications.  The many innovative applications of the global
              positioning system are one example.  Another more pertinent example is the
              novel application of weather radar data to such fields as hydrology, bird and
              insect studies, and climatology, to name a few.  There would be many new uses
              if these data sets were easily usable in the way this project address.
