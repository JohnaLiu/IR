Abstract    :
              The World Wide Web contains a vast and ever-growing collection of music audio
              files representing nearly every musical style, ensemble, genre, country,
              culture, and time period.   However, with the exception of the information
              conveyed in the title, the contents of such audio files can only be understood
              by listening to the files.  Thus searches of audio files analogous to those
              performed by text-based search engines are currently impossible.   In this
              project the PI will study and implement solutions to the "Signal to Score"
              problem in which an audio file is transcribed into a format capturing
              information similar to that contained in a printed musical score.   The PI's
              approach splits the task into two components: "Signal to Piano Roll" in which
              the musical signal is transcribed into a MIDI-like representation, and
              "Rhythmic Parsing" in which the piano roll representation is further
              transcribed into a musical score or equivalent representation.  The goal is to
              allow the generation of searchable data bases that contain high level music
              descriptions, which could be used to algorithmically answer questions on
              musical content such as "Is the audio file likely to be a blues song?" or "What
              is the time signature of the music?"
