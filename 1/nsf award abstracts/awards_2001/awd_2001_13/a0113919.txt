Title: ITR/IM(EHR)
              Course Capsules:  Persistent, Personalized Courseware

This project will
              design and implement a system that will store, organize, index and make
              searchable course content, and preserve that content reliably over long periods
              of time.  The specific plans include the systemic use of emerging XML standards
              to design a course model that supports both content and presentation markup. 
              Course Capsules will not only archive the university generated course
              materials, but also the creative work of the students.  Content markup will
              allow the Capsules to respond intelligently to requests by a user, and provide
              each student with a personalized depot of knowledge that remains available even
              after graduation.  For the faculty, Capsules will form a trusted repository of
              course material and will encourage sharing and reuse.  The archive in
              conjunction with extensive use tracking will provide a sound basis for ongoing
              review and improvement of curricula.
