Abstract    :
              People working collaboratively must establish and maintain awareness of one
              another's intentions, actions, and results. Understanding the role of awareness
              in computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW) and developing effective
              software tools to support awareness are keys to the future success of CSCW
              systems. This project will develop and evaluate a suite of awareness tools to
              support coordinated planning, action, and outcome analysis in collaborative
              science learning. Classroom-based field studies will be coordinated with a
              series of laboratory investigations, to benefit from both the scope and
              ecological validity of a field study and the analytical focus and control of
              laboratory studies. Laboratory studies will adapt task simulation methods,
              including the use of confederate participants, from the social psychology of
              communication. A key scientific objective is to investigate and develop the
              notion of activity awareness, the awareness of project work that supports group
              performance in complex and long-term tasks. Activity awareness builds upon
              prior research on social awareness (of the presence of one's collaborators) and
              action awareness (of what collaborators are doing or what they have recently
              done). Developing a concept of activity awareness can further integrate
              awareness research and tool support.
