Abstract    :
              The award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research and the Major Research
              Instrumentation program will enable James Madison University to acquire a large
              sample atomic force / scanning tunneling microscope (AFM / STM) for use by
              undergraduate research students at JMU in materials science and biomaterials
              oriented projects. These projects include in-situ monitoring of the
              biodegradation of polymer thin films, electrochemical etching and deposition on
              III-V semiconductors, determination of the surface ultrastructure on bacterial
              inclusion bodies, microstructural analysis of protein-DNA interactions, and
              non-destructive imaging of wafer-scale surface engineering through the use of
              self assembled monolayers (SAMs). This instrument will be used in the training
              of undergraduate students and local high school teachers in scanning probe
              microscopy, surface chemistry and physics and nanotechnology through
              coursework, experimental modules and demonstrations, and will help prepare
              future generations of scientists in the study of nanometer-scale
              phenomena.  The award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research and the
              Major Research Instrumentation program will enable James Madison University to
              acquire a large sample atomic force / scanning tunneling microscope (AFM / STM)
