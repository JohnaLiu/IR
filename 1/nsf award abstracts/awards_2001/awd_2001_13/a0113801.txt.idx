Abstract    :
              0113801 Affatigato  This is a 36 month U.S.- China cooperative project
              between Dr. Mario Affatigato of Coe College and Professor Wencheng Wang, Fudan
              University, Shanghai, China, to study the structural origin of photosensitivity
              in lead glasses, and to provide an REU training opportunity for four U.S.
              undergraduate students.  This research is designed to uncover the structural
              origin of photosensitivity in glass.  This collaboration makes use of Coe
              College's expertise in glass synthesis and structure characterization, and
              Fudan University's work on optical properties.  The expertise between the two
              campuses is mutually beneficial.  The most impressive part of this project is
              the educational benefit that the U.S. students can derive from this
              collaboration.  These exchanges will enrich the research experience of the
              students at Coe College, which is an undergraduate teaching college.  This
              project provides the students a significant research experience in their
              undergraduate education. The proposal will be jointly supported by the National
              Science Foundation of China and the NSF.
