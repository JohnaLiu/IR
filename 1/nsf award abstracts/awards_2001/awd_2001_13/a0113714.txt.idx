Abstract    :
              An interdisciplinary group of four physicists and four chemists have common
              research interests in molecular magnetism, new materials synthesis, and
              nanotechnology, and in several cases, formal interdisciplinary collaborations
              exist.  A variety of new magnetic systems and nanodevices are prepared, and
              they are presently characterized by magnetotransport, nuclear magnetic
              resonance (NMR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), atomic force microscopy
              (AFM), near-field microscopy (NFM), and other spectroscopies including
              infrared, ultraviolet/visible, and Raman techniques. This award from the
              Instrumentation for Materials Research program will allow the University of
              Florida to enhance its characterization capability with the acquisition of a
              modern magnetometer, a Quantum Design MPMS 7 Tesla SQUID magnetometer.  The new
              instrument will have significant impact on a number of researchers at the
              University of Florida with activities related to magnetic phenomena.  In
              addition, this new instrument will serve as an important interdisciplinary
              educational and training tool for graduate students and postdoctoral
              researchers who will operate the equipment.  Finally, the University of Florida
              has committed funding which represents 30% of the total cost of the
              instrument.  An interdisciplinary group of four physicists and four chemists
