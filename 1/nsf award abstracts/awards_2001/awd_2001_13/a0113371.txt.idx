Abstract    :
              Proposal No:  0113371 ITR/SY: Combinatorial Optimization Algorithms for
              Information Access (Fundamental IT Models) PI: Eva Tardos  The enormous
              growth in the amount of information online makes it vital to automate the job
              of searching and organizing large data collections while maintaining high
              accuracy. The research will consider two seemingly unrelated
              tasks:  .	Searching web pages, and .	Analyzing the content of digital
              pictures and movies.  Despite their obvious great importance, and the large
              efforts invested, the currently available solutions for these tasks are
              inadequate. The proposed research will address a difficult mathematical
              problem that underlies both of these tasks, the classification problem with
              pair-wise constraints.    The traditional classification problems consist
              of a set of objects to be classified, and a set of labels (the classes).
              Classifying the topics of documents on the Web, or individual pixels or
              regions of an image are two examples of this general problem. The proposed
              research will build on the PIs recent successes in applying powerful
              combinatorial optimization techniques to develop algorithms for
              classification problems with pair-wise relationships.  Pair-wise constraints
              can significantly enhance classification, by modeling, e.g., the relations of
              physically close objects in an image, or relations implicit in the hyperlink
              structure of the Web. The outcome of this research will be to provide powerful
              new tools for two important tasks in searching and organizing large data
              collections.
