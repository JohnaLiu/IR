Abstract    :
              The Million Book project is a multinational initiative to create a digital
              online archive of at least a million books and manuscripts freely available to
              anyone at any time.  It will enhance research, learning and teaching by making
              a critical mass of scholarly information freely available to read online.  It
              will support the needs of citizens for practical information and recreational
              reading as well as supporting scholarship and education.  India, and possibly
              China, will supply the manpower for scanning centers while the U. S. provides
              equipment and software.  This pilot project supplies the startup money for the
              first few scanning centers.
