Abstract    :
              Proposal No:  0113515 ITR/SY: A Flexible Framework for Secure Information
              Sharing Among Collaborating Organizations PI: Jajodia Sushil  This proposal
              seeks to develop a exible framework for secure information  sharing among
              collaborating organizations. The approach will be to extend the Flexible
               Authorization Framework (FAF) designed by the PI and his colleagues. FAF is
              based on an  authorization specication language that has rule based syntax and
              sound, non-monotonic logic based  semantics. The rst goal of this proposal is
              to enhance FAF to include information ow  controls, provisional
              authorizations, delegation of authority, and a rather broad sense of
               revocation capabilities of granted permissions. The second undertaking is to
              investigate ecient  implementation of the resulting framework that is based on
              the best practices of the security  community. The third goal of this proposal
              is to investigate the properties of basic constructs  that are used to compose
              security policies. The main deliverables of this proposal are a reference
              architecture,  mathematics and algorithms for security specications of
              information access and ow, their ecient  implementation techniques, and an an
              algebra for policy compositions.
