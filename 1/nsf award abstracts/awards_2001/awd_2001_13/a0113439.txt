Abstract    :
              This project will attack several important problems in image processing and
              computer vision. The applications for this work include object detection and
              recognition (e.g. for tracking objects in video surveillance), segmentation of
              medical images (e.g. for recognizing white and gray matter in MRI brain data),
              occlusion and analysis of missing information (e.g. for finding depth from 2-D
              images), and direction diffusion (e.g. for analyzing fingerprints). The project
              will work at the boundary between computational and applied mathematics,
              computer science and engineering, and medical imagery.

The research is based
              on using level set techniques applied to variational models and partial
              differential equations derived from the images. The work uses an active contour
              model without edges for object detection, based on the Osher-Sethian level set
              method and Mumford-Shah segmentation techniques. This model has many advantages
              over classical ones, including automatic detection of interior contours and
              robustness with respect to noise. The project will generalize and extend this
              basic model and provide computationally efficient implementations.
