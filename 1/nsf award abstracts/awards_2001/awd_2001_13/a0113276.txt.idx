Abstract    :
              Many of the recent successes in behavioral neuroscience in both invertebrate and
              vertebrate systems have been attained by identifying individual neurons and
              assessing the role of each neuron in behavior by physiologically manipulating
              its activity level. There are, however, aspects of behavior that have not been
              adequately explained by this approach. In the case of the medicinal leech, the
              neuronal network controlling the initiation of swimming is well-understood at
              several levels, but this understanding does not account for the
              unpredictability with which stimulation of this pathway leads to swimming. Two
              possible reasons for this inadequacy will be addressed in this proposal: (1)
              neuronal networks provide static descriptions of the system and do not
              accurately reflect their dynamics, and (2) even simple behaviors are a function
              of large populations of neurons distributed throughout the nervous system.
               Because of the inherent complexity in the firing patterns of large
              populations of neurons, computational approaches are necessary for deciphering
              how the nervous system encodes behavior. This project will use linear
              statistical and spectral techniques and nonlinear techniques, in conjunction
              with discrete wavelet transforms, to test: (1) whether the 'state' or pattern
              of ongoing activity in the leech nerve cord prior to stimulation determines the
              likelihood that swimming will be elicited by a specific input, and (2) whether
              the neuronal control of swim initiation is a distributed property of the entire
              ventral nerve cord or is localizable to neuronal activity from specific regions
              of the leech nervous system.   This project will provide research experiences
              for 10 undergraduate students from a primarily undergraduate women's college.
