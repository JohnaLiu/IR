This award provides
              support for a collaborative project between two biologists (Jansen and Boore)
              and three computer scientists (Moret, Warnow, and Bader) to develop and test 
              new algorithms and software for constructing evolutionary trees (phylogenies)
              from the rapidly increasing amount of genomic data.  The estimation of
              phylogenies is crucial to a wide range of basic and applied biological problems
              such as the epidemiology of AIDS, the identification of viral agents, the
              analysis of protein structure and function, the prediction of RNA structure;
              and, of course, it is the basic tool for inferring evolutionary history. 
              Methods for the reconstruction of phylogenies are most commonly applied to DNA
              sequences.  In many cases these sequences change at rates that are too low or
              too high for recovering accurate evolutionary trees.  One new type data that is
              fast gaining favor in the biology community is gene order and content within
              whole genomes, but so far very few computational methods have been developed
              for these types of data.  

The three goals of the project are to:  (1)
              develop algorithms and software for reconstructing evolutionary trees from gene
              order and content data; (2) assess the performance of these algorithms through
              extensive simulation studies under parameter-rich models of genome evolution
              and through application to real datasets; and (3) develop high-performance
              implementations of the best algorithms designed in the project using algorithm
              engineering techniques and a flexible approach to parallelization.  This
              project will make significant contributions in biology, through the development
              of new models of genome evolution and an improved understanding of the
              evolution of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes, and in computer science,
              through the development and testing of new algorithms for genomic data and the
              application of high-performance computing to problems in phylogenetic
              analysis.
