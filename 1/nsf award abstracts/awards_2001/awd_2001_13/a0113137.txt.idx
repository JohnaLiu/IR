Abstract    :
              EIA-0113137 Yanhua Shih University of Maryland Baltimore County  Title: ITR:
              Quantum Entanglement, Information and Computation   This project consists of
              a series of experimental and theoretical investigations on multi-photon
              entangled states and their fundamental role in quantum information and quantum
              computing. Major efforts underway include experimental and theoretical
              investigations on N-photon (N>2 entangled states) and on "partial entanglement"
              in quantum information and quantum computation theory.   Theoretical
              characterization of entanglement in mixed states is at the core of this
              project. The experimental investigations focus on two projects.  The first one
              is the realization of source of three-photon entangled states. These may lead
              to experimental generation of GHz states.  The second experimental project is
              quantum teleportation based on the improvement on the realization of Bell-state
              detection.
