Abstract    :
              Currently, automatic attacks are a major threat to computer security.  For
              example, the cheapest home PC can try thousands of "probes" against a targeted
              system.  A brute-force password (or PIN number) guessing program can generate
              and try tens of thousands of candidate passwords each second.  Or a home PC
              could attempt to flood a web site with thousands of "bogus" requests. 
                While there methods that attempt to stop such attacks they all can be
              defeated to some degree.  We propose a new approach to this security based on
              technology that can tell the difference between robots and humans.  Thus, we
              can disallow automatic attacks.  Our technology allows a new kind of
              restriction: now systems can insist that only humans have access to their
              valuable resources and they can disallow robots.  The proposed solution to
              the problem is inspired by Turing's test for artificial intelligence.  The
              fundamental idea of the solution is for a computer system to first ask the
              author of every transaction to solve a puzzle before accepting or executing the
              transaction.  The content of the puzzle will be based on grand challenge
              problems in the domains of pattern recognition, visual interpretation, and
              natural language understanding. These problems have the essential property that
              people can solve them easily while computers are not likely to solve them in
              the foreseeable future.  A typical puzzle would consist of the computer system
              sending the agent a bit-mapped image and the agent replying with an ascii
              string.  The image might include a picture and a question and a question about
              that picture, such as "Please type the following handwritten word" or "Which of
              the objects in this picture are edible?" The computer system determines whether
              the transaction author is a human based on the answer supplied.  This
              puzzle-solving process leads to a new framework for building secure computer
              systems.  In this framework, a human being has to be directly involved (by
              solving the puzzle and typing in the answer) in the authentication or other
              processes that are vulnerable to automatic attacks, referred to as Mandatory
              Human Participation (MHP).  Apparently, no automatic attack to the protected
              process would be possible under this framework.  Our proposed research is to
              build a pilot system that can be used to demonstrate the basic idea of MHP. 
              This will be based mostly on character based methods.  We then, plan to
              carefuly test and measure how well our system performs and how well it is
              received by users.
