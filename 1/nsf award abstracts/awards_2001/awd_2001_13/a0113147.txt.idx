Abstract    :
              The proposal addresses the problem of simultaneous control of a machine - e.g. a
              robot - by a number of independent operators. Such situations are likely to
              appear, for example, when robots are controlled via Internet from various
              locations, and also in tele-immersion and teleworking. As a possibility, inputs
              from the participants may be combined to generate a single control stream -
              which is equivalent to the participants collaborating rather competing with
              each other.  New fundamental reaserch issues that appear in systems with
              multi-user control of a single device - in the context of theory, algorithms,
              and system implementation - will be investigated.
