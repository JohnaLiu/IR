Abstract    :
              This project improves instructional capability of computer science and security
              faculty with respect to emerging sociological, ethical, linguistic,
              communication, and educational issues associated with information assurance and
              security. This project provides an intensive institute accommodating groups of
              faculty members for two years. Participating faculty develop a portfolio of
              educational materials for use in both their own and other educational programs
              with the help of subject matter experts. The program objectives are designed to
              help improve the capability of participating computer science faculty to teach
              effective security practice and design. These include developing a core of
              multi-disciplinary subject-matter expert mentors; producing research based
              curricular materials; recruiting undergraduate and graduate computer science
              and security faculty; developing subject-matter and pedagogical knowledge and
              skills of faculty attendees; and facilitating adaptation and implementation of
              curricular materials. There are plans to evaluate project outcomes and the
              impact of the project model and activities and to disseminate curricular
              materials to the broader community.
