Abstract    :
              Current interfaces employ textual representations, and restrict people from
              exploiting their spatial abilities to assist in dealing with the increasingly
              expanding information sphere they confront.  This project is motivated by the
              view that spatial and temporal organization of images can serve as effective
              interface components and may offer multiple advantages over textual lists of
              titles and URLs. It explores several image-based applications: (1) Visual
              bookmarks and visual site indexes, that replace textual URLs with images from
              the pages; (2) Visual browsing summaries and activity histories, that use
              images as a way of accessing previous web-based activities; (3) Image augmented
              query results, that add images to the results of web searches to help
              disambiguate them.
