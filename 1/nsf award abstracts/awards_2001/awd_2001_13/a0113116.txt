ADVANCED MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY


This award supports partially
              the participation by 20 American faculty and researchers in the Engineering
              Foundation Conference, "Advanced Membrane Technology", being held in Barga,
              Italy, from October 14 to 19, 2001. The conference brings together leading
              researchers in the areas of new membrane synthesis and membrane-process
              applications. It highlights new developments in the field as well as research
              opportunities for the future.  It brings together both academic and industrial
              researchers from throughout the world.  Topics range from membrane synthesis
              through separation processes for liquids and for gases to membrane
              reactors.

Funding is provided to support  partially participation  costs of
              some invited speakers and particularly of junior-faculty, post-doctoral, 
              graduate student attendees from the U.S.   The impact of this award is not only
              its direct contribution to further development of  effective membrane
              separation processes but also its stimulus in bringing academic U.S.
              researchers into productive contact with industrial and international
              colleagues.
