Abstract    :
              Abstract CTS-0113527 Joseph Klewicki, University of Utah  It is proposed to
              establish a repository of raw data that are obtained from the NSF-funded
              Surface Layer Turbulence and Environmental Science Test  (SLTEST) facility in
              Utah.  The conceptual objective is to develop software tools and data
              repositories so that the massive amount of data obtained from SLTEST
              measurements can be managed and processed in an efficient manner, and can be
              made available to the scientific community.
