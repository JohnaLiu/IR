               LTREB: Integrated study of behavioral and morphological development in
              free-living carnivores Proposal #IBN0113170  Kay E. Holekamp Barbara L.
              Lundrigan Kim T. Scribner  Spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are long-lived,
              gregarious carnivores exhibiting a unique suite of behavioral, endocrine, and
              morphological characteristics. Since 1988, Dr. Holekamp and associates have
              been studying the behavioral ecology of members of one large spotted hyena
              population in Kenya, focusing mainly on the development of social behavior.
              Age, sex, kin relations, and social status are known for all natal animals in
              the study population, and social histories are known for all hyenas under 13
              years of age. Most adult clan members of both sexes wear radio collars so they
              can be regularly located and observed. The proposed LTREB project will support
              new aspects of long-term research with this study population. Specifically, Dr.
              Holekamp will join forces with a morphometrician (Dr. Lundrigan) and a
              geneticist (Dr. Scribner) to achieve three new goals. (1) First, a novel
              combination of behavioral and morphometric techniques will be used to examine
              age-related changes in morphology of the feeding apparatus, diet, feeding
              behavior, and feeding performance. This portion of the proposed work will
              include documentation (with new and archived data) of age-related change in
              chewing, foraging, feeding behavior, and diet; administration of simple
              performance tests in the field to assess maximal feeding capabilities at each
              age; and quantitative analysis of age-related changes in skull morphology. (2)
              The second goal is to start monitoring behavior, growth, and demography in a
              second spotted hyena population (one less exposed to humans) to inquire whether
              age-related constraints on foraging abilities might make certain age-sex
              classes of hyenas more vulnerable than others to effects of anthropogenic
              disturbance. (3) Finally, in both hyena populations, genetic markers, in
              conjunction with behavioral data, will be used to elucidate the relationship
              between behavioral responses to anthropogenic disturbance and fitness
              decrements associated with such disturbance.  The proposed work will shed
              considerable light on the natural and anthropogenic selection pressures acting
              on hyenas during each stage of life. It will also combine several different
              data types, all collected in a natural ecological and evolutionary context, to
              integrate traditionally disjunct approaches to the study of life history
              evolution. The results should be important not only for understanding the
              unique suite of traits expressed by spotted hyenas, but more generally, for
              understanding the role of age-related constraints in the evolution of behavior.
              With the data from the two different hyena study populations, it will be
              possible to quantify the effects of anthropogenic disturbance concurrently on
              both behavior and fitness, identify ecological variables that might be
              responsible for population differences, and assess the relative effects of
              these variables on animals in different age, sex, and rank classes. This is a
              unique opportunity to document the adaptive consequences of behavioral change
              in response to human activity. It is hoped that the proposed work will serve as
              a model for understanding the complex relationships among behavior, morphology,
              fitness, demography, and human disturbance in other mammalian carnivores,
              including those that are rare and endangered.
