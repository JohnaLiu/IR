Abstract    :
              This award to New York University is for the acquisition of an Atomic Force
              Microscope for DNA nanotechnology research and education. The features of the
              AFM include tapping mode, lithography mode and automatic high-resolution
              scanning. DNA technology is an area of materials science developed at NYU over
              the past two decades.  It is based on the combination of stable branched DNA
              motifs and their specific associations as directed biotechnological technique,
              DNA sticky-ended cohesion.  Early projects in this area involved the assembly
              of geometrical objects, such as a DNA cube and a DNA truncated octahedron that
              could be characterized by gel electrophoresis. The species made at NYU are
              novel materials that are expected to have applications in nanoelectronics,
              nanorobotics, information storage, and structural biophysics.  Experiments are
              underway to organize nanoelectronic components in 2D arrays by attaching them
              to DNA arrays.  The incorporation of the sequence-activated device into an
              array will lead to the large numbers of structurally distinct states that
              characterize nanorobotics.  Mechanical and chemical modification of arrays can
              lead to information storage systems. This instrumentation will accelerate
              significantly the development of this field. The award will contribute to the
              training and education of graduate students and postdocs in this new area of
              materials research. %%% This award to New York University is for the
