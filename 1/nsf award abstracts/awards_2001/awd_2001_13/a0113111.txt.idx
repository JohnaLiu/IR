Abstract    :
              0113111 Street   A number of computational and numerical tools will be
              synthesized to produce an innovative and powerful coastal ocean simulation
              tool. The primary goal of the project is to employ numerical large-eddy
              simulation to generate accurate predictions of motions and transport in coastal
              oceans under conditions when a non-hydrostatic and terrain-following
              representation is essential. The model should be able to handle all processes
              from the free surface to the bed so that the whole range from surface waves
              through internal waves to sediment motions can be simulated. The second goal is
              to apply the best algorithms available to create a simulation code that is
              capable or representing the physical processes at high resolution and capable
              of very high speed on multiple processor parallel computer.    The project
              code will evolve from an existing semi-implicit numerical code for
              nonhydrostatic free-surface flows on unstructured grids. The code is based on
              the three-dimensional unsteady Navier-Stokes equations and utilizes a
              semi-implicit algorithm that is robust, stable, and very efficient. However,
              the existing code was developed for serial machines and lacks a number of
              important elements for the coastal ocean application, e.g., a scalar or
              material transport module, state-of-the-art subfilter-scale models for
              large-eddy simulation, and a highly-resolved treatment of the bathymetric or
              coastal boundaries. The focus of this work is to parallelize the code and
              install appropriate algorithms to meet both the need to represent the physics
              accurately and the need to produce a fast and robust production code for the
              coastal zone. A fundamental concept will be to seamlessly imbed the coastal
              simulations in larger-scale simulations so that natural boundary conditions
              would be applied around the entire domain. No artificial devices would be used
              to filter the simulations to avoid code instabilities or boundary reflections.
              The unstructured grid will be employed in horizontal planes allowing accurate
              representation of bathymetric and coastal features, which require severe
              changes in grid density from one subdomain to another. The composite grid
              method will be employed to fit a terrain-following highly resolved grid over
              the bathymetry and linked to the interior domain.   Two specific applications
              of the completed code are planned. Both involve nonhydrostatic evolution of
              internal tides. The first is in Monterey Bay, California, where solitons are
              expected to form and the internal tide signal is intensified in the bottom of
              the Monterey Canyon. The second is in Mamala Bay, Hawaii, where high-amplitude
              and nonlinear internal tides are observed and there are key questions to be
              answered about the nature of these waves and their behavior in the Bay.   The
              contributions on this work include: High performance: Parallel implementation
              using MPI, the message passing interface; Optimized unstructured-grid, 3D
              parallel-solver for the nonhydrostatic pressure; Code Features: Accurate
              advection based on the TVD method for unstructured grids; Nonhydrostatic
              large-eddy simulation with a fully-validated velocity estimation method for
              subfilter-scale motions; State-of-the-art grid generation [unstructured in the
              horizontal] for accurate resolution of complex bathymetry and shore boundaries
              and an embedded bottom following grid; Free surface using a semi-implicit
              treatment; and Production-style: Detailed users' manual that illustrates the
              use of the code for coastal-ocean scale simulations
