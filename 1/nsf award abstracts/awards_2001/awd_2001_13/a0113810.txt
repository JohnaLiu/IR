Compositional Connectors
David Garlan

For systems
              composed from independently developed parts, specialized forms of
interaction
              are often needed to bridge component mismatches or to achieve
extra-functional
              properties (e.g., security, reliability), making the design and
implementation
              of these interaction mechanisms a critical issue.  Unfortunately,
system
              developers have few options: they must live with available, but
              often
inadequate, generic support for interaction (such as RPC), or they
              must
handcraft specialized mechanisms at great cost.

This research
              investigates a new approach whereby interaction mechanisms are
constructed
              compositionally.  Specifically, basic connectors (such as RPC or
data streams)
              can be augmented with selected adaptations or enhancements to
produce a more
              complex connector that meets the system requirements.  This
work will
              investigate the hypothesis that (a) there exists a collection
              of
general-purpose transformations that can be applied to connectors to
              produce
increasingly rich forms of interaction, and (b) tools can be built to
              automate
the application of these transformations to existing interaction
              mechanisms.
If successful, this research will reduce the cost of component
              integration by
partially automating the production of complex interaction
              mechanisms, improve
the quality of systems by making it simple to add security
              and dependability
features, and develop new foundations for specifying and
              reasoning about complex
interaction mechanisms.
