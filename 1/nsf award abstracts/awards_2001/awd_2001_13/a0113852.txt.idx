Abstract    :
              This project aims to advance the state of the art in fast iterative algorithms
              for large-scale semidefinite programming and eigenvalue optimization, guided by
              applications to first-principles computation of properties of systems of many
              electrons.  Semidefinite optimization codes will be rewritten to replace dense
              linear algebra and direct matrix factorizations by iterative solution processes
              suited to large and sparse problems.  Numerical experiments will be carried out
              with different mathematical formulations and implementations of the sparse
              optimization procedures.  The guiding application is a variational formulation
              of the electronic structure ground state problem in which the unknowns are the
              one-body and two-body reduced density matrices of a many electron system.  This
              application gives rise to a large semidefinite program having sparse solution
              matrices and an extremely sparse constraint set.  The codes that are developed
              under this grant will be written and documented with the intent of wide
              dissemination.  Semidefinite programming is a valuable framework for many
              scientific and engineering applications, including systems control, structural
              analysis, combinatorial optimization, statistical estimation and VLSI design,
              just to name a few well-established ones besides electronic structure theory. 
              This project aims to increase our ability to compute solutions to problem
              instances whose size places them beyond the reach of current numerical methods.
               As to the specific application in this project, the computation of properties
              of many-body systems on the basis of quantum mechanics is fundamental to the
              understanding of molecular and solid state structure, chemical and elementary
              biochemical processes, and mechanical and electromagnetic properties of
              condensed matter.  Potential benefits to technology and society from advances
              in the accuracy and scale of many-body quantum mechanical computations include,
              for example, better design of semiconductors, magnetic storage materials,
              high-temperature superconductors and chemical catalysts, as well as
              improvements in the emerging areas of rational drug design and the design of
              carbon nanostructures.
