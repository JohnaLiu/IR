Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  DMS-0113236 Madigan - Rutgers University  Digital networked
              environments such as the Web play an increasingly important role in our lives.
              More than 135 million Americans have Internet access (Source: eTForecasts) and
              on average use that connection 4.2 hours per week (Source:
              PriceWaterhouseCoopers).  All this activity generates vast and complex "digital
              traces".  Appropriate analyses of these traces can lead to an unprecedented
              understanding of online behavior, and, in turn, to substantial improvements in
              the design of digital environments.  These data present challenges to
              traditional statistical methods due to their complexity and massive scale.  We
              will develop novel statistical technology to address these
              challenges.  Specifically, this project will develop Bayesian statistical
              methodology for analyzing data from digital environments.  The Bayesian
              approach to data analysis is uniquely suited to the kind of multi-level and
              hierarchically structured data that the project focuses on. Bayesian methods
              have a rich history but have only become practicable in recent years due to
              advances in computing power and numerical methods. The methodological research
              will ground itself in a series of applications. The essential contribution,
              however, will be to develop a practical Bayesian methodology for these data. 
              There exists a significant educational barrier to the widespread use of
              Bayesian methods. The project will also develop and disseminate a
              graduate-level multidiscipliniary course in Bayesian methods.
