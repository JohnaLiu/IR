Abstract    :
              0113148 Carton   This project will provide improved estimates of the
              historical changes in the climate of the oceans by using direct and indirect
              observations to constrain numerical models of the global ocean circulation,
              temperature, and salinity through application of sequential estimation
              techniques. Application of sequential estimation to the problem of ocean
              reanalysis faces a number of problems. Full implementation is impractical on
              current computers. Further problems result from the presence of long spatial
              and temporal correlation scales in the observation minus forecast model
              differences. In addition, the subsurface data sets are limited and
              non-stationary. This project will exploit modern developments in computer
              science and meteorology to address these challenges. The specific focus is on
              variability of the global ocean during the 60-year period 1940-2000. A suite of
              preliminary reanalyses of the monthly temperature, salinity, and velocity
              fields of the ocean has been conducted using data assimilation, which have
              helped to identify a number of problems that must be surmounted. At the same
              time, there have been substantial improvements in the database of historical
              observations. This project will support an interdisciplinary collaboration
              between an oceanographer and meteorologist at University of Maryland (Jim
              Carton and Eugenia Kalnay) and an applied mathematician at NASA/GSFC (Dick Dee)
              to continue to explore new computational methods and algorithms developed for
              the problem of atmospheric data assimilation to explore seasonal to decadal
              variability of the oceans. The scientific objectives also address parts of the
              first of the scientific objectives of the CLImate Variability and
              predictability (CLIVAR) program: to describe and understand the physical
              processes responsible for climate variability and predictability on seasonal,
              interannual, decadal and centennial time scales, through the collection and
              analysis of observations and the development and application of models of the
              coupled climate system, in cooperation with other relevant climate research and
              observing programs (CLIVAR, 1998). Funding is provided through the Information
              Technology Research Initiative and the CLIVAR program. 0113148
