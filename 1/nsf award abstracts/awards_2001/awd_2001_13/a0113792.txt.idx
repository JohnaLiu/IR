Abstract    :
              NSF PROPOSAL #0113792   ITR: Aligning Societal Values, Privacy Policy, and IT
              Requirements  Colin Potts, Georgia Institute of Technology Annie I. Anton,
              North Carolina State University  The guarantee and assurance of privacy must
              be included in the design of information technologies from the onset. This
              research focuses on how society uses, values, and protects citizens' personal
              information.  From the perspective of system design, software engineers need
              methods and tools to enable them to design systems that reflect those values
              and protect personal information, accordingly. This research examines how
              privacy considerations and value systems influence the design, deployment and
              consequences of IT. Investigations will include study of the motivations and
              barriers to the use of IT when use of these technologies requires the user to
              provide Personally Identifiable Information (PII). In essence, this work
              focuses on: societal values, web site policies, and the operational functioning
              of web-based e-commerce systems, which are often misaligned. The goal is to
              develop concepts, tools and techniques that help IT professionals and policy
              makers bring policies and system requirements into better alignment. An
              action-oriented set of conceptual tools, including guidelines and
              privacy-relevant policy templates will be constructed and validated. The tools
              will be fully documented and illustrated on a web site developed for the
              purpose of conducting the proposed project and disseminating results and
              recommendations.
