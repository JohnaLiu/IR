Abstract    :
              This project addresses the need to improve the way we access
experimental data
              and theoretical models associated with nuclear and particle physics reactions.
              Tools will be developed in order to achieve: (1) more efficient searching
              within the database of existing measurements; (2) interactive comparisons
              between data and models constructed to describe them; (3) the incorporation of
              new measurements into the system. A wide range of capabilities will be
              presented in order to satisfy both the novice and advanced users. Private
              accounts will be available to professionals wishing to analyze preliminary
              experimental results, or plan for new measurements. Methodsdeveloped here will
              be applicable to other scientific databases as well. Linking such sites through
              the Internet promises to accelerate much of the background checking required in
              scientific research.
