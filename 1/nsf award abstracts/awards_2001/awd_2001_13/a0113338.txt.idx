Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to develop high speed optoelectronic
              devices based on semiconductor optical amplifiers, for applications in optical
              information technologies, networks, instrumentation and signal processing. The
              key devices will be novel ultrahigh speed multiwavelength semiconductor laser
              transmitters, modulators , nonlinear optical switches and optical clock
              recovery oscillators. These semiconductor optical amplifier based devices will
              then be configured together to demonstrate unique high-speed capabilities in
              next generation information technology applications.  An important feature of
              this research project is that the devices are based on an identical
              semiconductor layered structure and common device processing and fabrication
              techniques. This is significant because this philosophy allows for cost
              effective state-of-the-art device development, with the potential of the
              technology becoming readily available for commercial applications, owing to the
              ease of fabrication, from a manufacturing perspective.    In addition, since
              each of the devices are realized by using a single common processing procedure
              on an identical semiconductor layered structure, the potential for
              demonstrating fully monolithic ultrahigh-speed information is great. These two
              features are critical in that the development of high-speed optoelectronic
              technologies are essential elements for commercial applications of information
              technology in the global economy.  1.1 Methods to be employed The research
              program will use standard optoelectronic device fabrication techniques to
              develop a set of 4 optoelectronic devices, e.g., transmitters, modulators,
              switches, and clock recovery oscillators, that will be used in three critical
              commercial information technology application areas: 1) high capacity optical
              links for both access and wide area networks, 2) high speed optical sampling
              for analogue to digital applications, and 3) wideband optical/rf analog
              information systems using arbitrary optical waveform generation.  The PI will
              exploit his latest findings on the fundamental physics of ultrashort pulse
              propagation in semiconductor optical amplifiers and the associated nonlinear
              optical effects, to demonstrate unique modes of operation of these devices, for
              high speed photonic functionality. As an example, he will exploit these novel
              effects to achieve both temporal and spectral control of ultrafast optical
              signals.  Specifically, he will demonstrate: o multiwavelength modelocked
              operation of semiconductor diode lasers o ultra-stable, ultrahigh bit rate,
              single wavelength 160 Gb/s semiconductor laser sources o cost-effective
              semiconductor optical amplifier modulators and modulator arrays o novel
              high-speed optical clock recovery oscillators at 40 GHz o all optical
              switching and processing of WDM byte wide parallel data packets, showing the
              potential for ultrahigh speed parallel optical signal processing.  The
              developed device functionality will be incorporated to demonstrate o hybrid
              WDM-OTDM links for a) access and b) wide area networks o optical sampling in
              optical analog to digital converters o arbitrary optical waveform generation
              for wideband optical & microwave photonic applications  Finally, he will use
              commercially available off the shelf components to realize prototypes that will
              facilitate technology transfer.  1.2 Significance to the Advancement of
              Knowledge: Educational & Scientific Impact From an educational perspective,
              the students trained in this research program will be exposed to a research
              environment that is vertically integrated. For example, the students will learn
              the physics and fundamentals of high speed optoelectronic device design and
              fabrication, the deployment of novel devices to realize unique high speed
              optoelectronic sub-system functionality, and finally, integrate several unique
              optoelectronic sub-system functions into a full ultrahigh speed optoelectronic
              system that will address needs in the information technology areas of
              networking, signal processing and instrumentation. This will allow the students
              to provide timely impact for prospective employers upon graduation.
