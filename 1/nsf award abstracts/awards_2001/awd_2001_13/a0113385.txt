Abstract

Reliable and seamless wireless
              connectivity in varied environments is a necessary requirement for the rich and
              diverse communications of the future. Space-time processing has emerged as a
              key enabling technology for future wireless communications: signal space
              dimensions are fundamental to reliable communication and antenna arrays augment
              the traditional dimensions of time and frequency with the spatial dimension.
              While recent theoretical and technological advances provide a tremendous boon
              for modern communications, the state-of-the-art is far from realizing the full
              potential of space-time processing due to significant gaps in our current
              understanding on two fronts:

Fundamental mechanisms underlying the
              interaction of the space-time channel with the signal space in spatial,
              temporal, and spectral dimensions.

Jointly optimized design of front-end
              hardware, antenna arrays, and signal processing algo-rithms.  

The overall
              goal of the work proposed here is an integrated approach to the design of
              antenna array hardware and space-time processing algorithms for significantly
              improved wireless link performance
at reduced cost and complexity.
