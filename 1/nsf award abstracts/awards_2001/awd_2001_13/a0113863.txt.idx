              Abstract 0113863 Galloway  N2001 - The Second International Nitrogen
              Conference  Production of food and energy increases the amount of
              biologically active nitrogen that circulates among the world's atmosphere,
              soils, forests, and waters.  The world's natural resources and environmental
              systems respond to nitrogen enrichment with positive benefits such as increased
              production of food and timber, and negative consequences, such as
              eutrophication of ecosystems, regional haze, and global warming.  The three
              goals of this conference are to increase scientific knowledge about N sources
              and effects; stimulate communication among leaders in N production and
              consumption; and explore balanced policy strategies by which to increase food
              and energy production while decreasing environmental impacts.
