Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the architecture and design of a
              single-chip
parallel computer system. As technology continues to improve and
              transistor
sizes decrease, the latency of on-chip interconnect wires will have
              a
greater impact on the performance of computer systems. In the
              future,
computer designers will need to develop architectures that avoid the
              use of
long interconnect wires in order to reduce the effect of this latency.
              One
such approach would be to include a number of small, simple
              processors
together on a single chip, forming a single-chip parallel computer.
              This
would reduce the effect of the latency because the length of
              the
interconnect wires would depend on the size and complexity of
              the
individual processors, not the size of the entire system. By keeping
              the
processors simple, long interconnect wires will not be necessary.
              The
challenge to designing such a system is determining the features that
              the
architecture must include. This research project will
              investigate
architectural features that provide low-overhead support for
              parallel
programs, applying them to the design of the SCMP
              (Single-Chip
Message-Passing) parallel computer. Through the extensive use
              of
simulation, the design and performance of the SCMP system will be
              analyzed
and compared to other computer architectures.
