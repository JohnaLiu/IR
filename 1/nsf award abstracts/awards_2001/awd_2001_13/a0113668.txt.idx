Abstract    :
               For the next generation Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) circuits, the
              signal delay will be dominated by parasitic resistance (R), capacitance (C),
              and inductance (L) of the interconnect.  The ability to extract RCL parasitic
              quickly and accurately is crucial to the design and verification of large VLSI
              circuits. This project will develop innovative algorithms and software for fast
              and accurate extraction of RCL parasitic of VLSI circuits. The main goal of
              the project is the design of preconditioned iterative methods for solving the
              linear systems arising in inductance and capacitance extraction problems.
              Solvers for the inductance problem will use a novel solenoidal basis approach
              to precondition a reduced system implicitly, leading to rapid convergence of
              the iterative methods. Fast approximations to the matrix-vector products with
              dense system matrices will be computed using efficient hierarchical methods.
                Parallelism in the algorithms will be exploited to develop high-performance
              software that is capable of tackling large problems.  Software developed for
              this project will be portable across a variety of parallel architectures. It
              is anticipated that the code will deliver the performance necessary for
              parasitic RCL extraction of deep sub-micron VLSI circuits of realistic sizes.
