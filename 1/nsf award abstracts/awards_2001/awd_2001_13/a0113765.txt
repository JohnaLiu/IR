Abstract    :
              This is an award supported jointly by the Information Technology Research
              program in Geosciences and the Physical Meteorology program.  The objective is
              to use archival data from the Los Alamos Scanning Raman Lidar on the spatial
              distribution of water vapor to develop a remote-sensing-based method for
              determining the evaporation rate as a function of position on the ground.  More
              generally, the procedure may be extended to estimate the surface distribution
              of emission rates for any measurable conservative passive additive.  It is an
              inverse problem in geophysical data analysis, because the distribution of the
              surface evaporation rate is determined from the measured three- dimensional
              pattern of vapor concentration and its variation with time.  The project is
              planned in two phases.  First the forward problem will be analyzed, in which
              various distributions of upwind emission rates will be assumed and the
              resulting vertical distributions of concentration calculated, for different
              combinations of stability and wind speed.  Next, the solution of the forward
              problem will be used to develop a mathematical inversion technique, whereby the
              spatial distribution of emission sources and their strengths will be determined
              from the lidar-observed 3D pattern.  The research holds the promise of
              discovering new ways to use remotely-sensed data for atmospheric observation,
              analysis, and modeling.
