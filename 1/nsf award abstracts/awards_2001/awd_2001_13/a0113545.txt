Abstract    :
              This project examines the effects of new information technology on science in
              developing areas over a five year period. The project team will study the
              impact of the Internet on research communication within the developing world
              and with the international scientific community through an analysis of the
              conditions associated with interpersonal networking and information search
              behavior. The study population consists of 360 scientists in three developing
              areas with different levels of research capacity (Ghana, Kenya, and the Indian
              state of Kerala) in two organizational contexts (universities, government
              research institutes). Each of these areas was the subject of a comprehensive
              1994 study of research communication just prior to the rapid expansion of the
              Internet. These scientists are located in twelve organizational sites: two
              universities and two research institutes in each of the three areas (Ghana,
              Kerala, Kenya) for a total of 120 scientists in each country. Several kinds of
              data will be collected for each scientist (conventional survey, network survey,
              Internet usage data, and email data). The project will (1) enhance basic
              connectivity by providing local area networks to research organizations with
              point connections, (2) assess the professional relationships, information
              search behavior, and changes in research practice over a five year period, (3)
              train faculty and graduate students in the social analysis of science and
              technology. The results will have a direct impact on scientific capacity
              through increased connectivity and decreased isolation of scientists in
              developing countries, a direct impact through training of scholars in the
              social analysis of science and technology, and an indirect impact through
              increased understanding of the types of linkages that are most likely to be
              utilized and sustained.
