Abstract    :
              This award is to partially fund the symposium "Biodiversity: the interface
              between systematics and conservation" held 23-27 June, 2000, in Bloomington,
              Indiana, at the joint meetings of the Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB),
              Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE), and the American Society of
              Naturalists (ASN), as well as the Association for Tropical Biology (ATB). this
              symposium is co-sponsored by the SSB and ATB. It will bring together
              researchers from a wide variety of fields related to biodiversity and
              conservation to discuss the relevance of systematics to their research and to
              evaluate various techniques that make use of systematic and taxonomic data. The
              topic is timely because of the increasing recognition of the importance of
              systematic data in conservation biology, and the wealth of new methods
              available for using systematic data in this context.
