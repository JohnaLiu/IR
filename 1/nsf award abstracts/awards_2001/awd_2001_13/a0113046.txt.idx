Abstract    :
              This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program to Princeton
              University supports the acquisition of equipment to enhance the quality of
              quantum-confined semiconductor structures grown in a molecular beam epitaxy
              (MBE) system. The equipment includes special (all-metal) gate valves and new
              effusion cells which will be installed in the MBE growth chamber. It will allow
              the growth of extremely clean (low-disorder), selectively doped GaAs/AlGaAs
              heterojunction structures in which electron interaction physics dominates. The
              MBE grown, high-quality structures will be used in on-going NSF-supported
              projects. Such structures provide a crucial and important test-bed for new
              many-body physics. The results can also have an impact on the realization of
              new devices whose fabrication and/or operation is based on semiconductor
              structures of similar type. The improved material will impact positively the
              research of several collaborators who receive high-quality GaAs/AlGaAs
              heterostructures from the PI. The equipment will be used primarily by the
              students and will therefore be crucial for their education and training. The
              award will strengthen high quality education integrated into forefront
              research. In addition, fabrication and the physics of advanced layered
              semiconductor structures are at the forefront of today's science and
              technology. Well-trained and educated students in this field will be invaluable
              resources for the US as well as the rest of the world.  This award from the
              Instrumentation for Materials Research program to Princeton University supports
              the acquisition of equipment to enhance the quality of quantum-confined
              semiconductor structures grown in a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system. The
