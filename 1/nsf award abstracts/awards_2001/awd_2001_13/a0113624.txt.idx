Abstract    :
              With support from the National Science Foundation, the University of Washington
              luminescence dating laboratory headed by Dr. James Feathers will purchase a
              Riso automated TL/OLS reader with automated processor which permits single
              grain luminescence determinations. Because of its increased efficiency over the
              instrument the laboratory currently employs, the Riso machine will both
              increase throughput and decrease cost per sample.  The Washington laboratory
              is the sole facility in the United States which routinely provides several
              types of  luminescence analysis (TL, OSL, IRSL) for archaeological samples and
              the resultant dates have come to play an increasingly important function for
              archaeologists. Because organic materials are present in only a limited number
              of sites many such occurrences are not amenable to radiocarbon dating and often
              luminescence provides the only alternative. Using a range of approaches it
              often possible to obtain dates from either ceramics or soil and in the former
              case luminescence has an advantage over radiocarbon since it can directly date
              the object of interest rather than associated material. Dr. Feathers has shown
              that luminescence may be as accurate as radiocarbon. Traditional luminescence
              techniques analyze bulk samples comprised of many individual grains and the
              results can be problematic since particles of multiple ages and exposure
              histories may be present. Machines such as the Riso automated reader avoid this
              problem since they can date individual grains. A distribution of individual
              readings provides insight into the nature of the sample itself - both admixture
              and differential degree of bleaching - and therefore the multiple
              determinations allow accuracy to be better determined.  Dr. Feathers'
              research is directed at both improvement of the technique itself and its
              application to anthropologically significant archaeological sites. He has
              addressed questions such as the development of complex societies in the
              southern United States, the time of human entry into the New World and the
              emergence of modern human behavior in sub Saharan Africa. Acquisition of the
              Riso instrument will significantly increase the effectiveness of such
              research.
