Abstract    :
              Quantum information processing will be addressed using laser trapped neutral
              atoms as the fundamental unit of information.  This component of a larger
              project will involve the effort to explore more flexible trap architecture
              based on arrays of tight-focus laser traps, which can overcome the limitations
              of optical lattices.
