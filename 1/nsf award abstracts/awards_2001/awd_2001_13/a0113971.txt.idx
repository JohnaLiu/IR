Abstract    :
              State-of-the-art run-time systems are a poor match to diverse, dynamic
              distributed applications because they are designed to provide support to a wide
              variety of applications, without much customization to individual specific
              requirements. Little or no information flows from the application to the
              run-time system to allow the latter to fully tailor its services to the
              application. As a result, the performance is disappointing. To address this
              problem, this project will pursue application-centric computing, or Smart
              Applications (SMARTAPPS). The overriding philosophy of SMARTAPPS is "measure,
              compare, and adapt if beneficial." That is, the application will continually
              monitor its performance and the available resources to determine if, and by how
              much, the application could improve its performance by restructuring. Then, if
              the potential performance benefit outweighs the projected overhead costs, the
              application will restructure itself and the underlying system accordingly. This
              process occurs continuously to adapt to the dynamic needs of the application
              and the availability of system resources. The adaptation can occur at various
              levels including selection of an algorithmic approach suitable for the current
              problem, run-time parallelization and other related compiler optimizations,
              tuning reconfigurable OS services (e.g. scheduling policy), and system
              configuration (e.g., selecting which computational resources to use). The
              SMARTAPPS framework provides performance monitoring and modeling components, as
              well as mechanisms for performing the actual restructuring, to integrate these
              levels of adaptation.  This project will test SMARTAPPS on several important
              computational science applications and representative platforms throughout the
              development process. From computational physics, it will study
              discrete-ordinates codes that simulate subatomic particle transport. From
              computational biology, it will study a molecular dynamics code and a code that
              simulates protein folding and ligand binding (also known as drug docking).
              SMARTAPPS will be developed and run on current distributed, heterogeneous
              platforms, including the ASCI machines, large NUMA machines, networks of
              workstations, and, ultimately, the Grid.
