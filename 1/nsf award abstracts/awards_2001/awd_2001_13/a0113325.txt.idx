Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this project is to design, implement and test a new display
              system for digital libraries. It is motivated by the lack of display
              capabilities in most systems today; we need more screen resolution and screen
              size.  This project will combine commodity video projectors and computing
              equipment with software to provide automatic calibration and to provide better
              interfaces to visualization techniques.  This will be of value in virtual
              reality environments and scientific data analysis environments as well as in
              digital library implementations.  The project will be done in partnership with
              a library at the University of Kentucky and a computing facility at the
              University of Puerto Rico.
