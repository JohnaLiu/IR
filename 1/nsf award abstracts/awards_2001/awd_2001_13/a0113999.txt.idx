Abstract    :
              Abstract  In this proposal, the PIs propose to build a system that would open
              the SIO shipboard data archives to web access with modern tools for users that
              would allow data queries and data mining via the Internet. This effort is
              visualized as part of a larger data base infrastructure for the wide MGG and
              Oceanographic community. The PIs would first develop a prototype system, then
              test the system and ask for comments from community users, and finally add more
              data and tools to the system. The effort would extend over a period much longer
              than the present 3 year grant, and is partly supported by SIO and others. An
              advisory committee would help guide the efforts of the group.
