Abstract    :
              EIA-0113718 Drake University Stuart Shulman  Title: ITR/PE: Digital
              Citizenship: Expanding Information Technology Literacy with a Service-Learning
              Approach   This is a proposal for a grant to promote service-learning as a
              model for the dissemination of Information Technology Literacy (ITL).
              Service-learning promotes mutually beneficial partnerships between academic
              institutions and communities. One goal is to empower communities to identify
              ITL needs that students can fulfill as part of their education. This grant
              would enable two central Iowa universities--Drake and Iowa State--to reach out
              to communities in need of ITL training and to assess the efficacy of
              service-learning interventions. Citizens are increasingly expected to interface
              with government using IT (ex. firstgov.gov). A number of studies have
              identified unequal levels of ITL as a significant barrier to equity in
              citizenship. While access to the Internet steadily expands, the ability to take
              advantage of increasing access hinges on the level of ITL among citizens.
              Community members, particularly in certain more vulnerable groups, often lack
              basic skills and concepts required when navigating an expanding electronic
              interface with government. Whereas IT should make it easier for all citizens to
              conduct their routine business with the government, in fact, it appears to be
              widening the gap between the IT literate and those without basic navigational
              skills. The primary objective of this research project is to test the efficacy
              of service-learning programs that seek to universalize digital citizenship.
              Three related objectives are to:      Define Information Technology Literacy
              (ITL) using broad and systematic criteria.     Develop, implement, and
              evaluate "best practices" for using service-learning in the dissemination of
              ITL.     Test the hypothesis that service-learning lessens the digital
              divide.  The proposed methodology uses experimental and control groups
              representing varying degrees of urbanization. A service-learning ITL class and
              fieldwork laboratory will establish links between undergraduates and the
              experimental groups. Researchers, students, and the serviced communities will
              develop and refine taxonomy of ITL skills. Experimental groups will be exposed
              to the service-learning treatment. Structured citizen surveys and focus groups
              will be used to analyze the data on program impact. Statistical analysis of
              covariance at specific points and variance over time will be employed to lay
              the groundwork for a predictive causal model. Several additional outcomes are
              expected as a result of this research. First, the study will model a new
              pedagogical intervention that links research, education, and community
              involvement in an effort to lessen the digital divide. Second, it makes the
              recipients of service the focus of scholarship. Most studies in this area focus
              on outcomes for the students rather than the recipients. Third, it focuses
              attention on the important distinction between IT access and IT literacy.
              Fourth, it promotes interdisciplinary research and training, as well as
              collaboration between public and private institutions seeking to incorporate IT
              into the campus curricula. Finally, it promotes innovation in the political
              science and education disciplines with the potential for a far-reaching impact
              on the basic definition of citizenship.
