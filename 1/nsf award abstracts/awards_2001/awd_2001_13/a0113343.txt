Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for the development of grid telemetry acquisition
              techniques for grid-enabled applications and instrumental middleware and fabric
              level devices.  Such telemetry data can be used for monitoring a wide area
              distributed IT infrastructure, for providing information to resource decision
              making services operating in the grid environment, and importantly for
              providing feedback to distributed application developers and middleware toolkit
              designers.  The grid telemetry infrastructure will be developed within the
              context of the distributed IT infrastructure being deployed for the ATLAS
              experiment currently under construction for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at
              the CERN Laboratory in Geneva Switzerland, the GriPhyN project, and the
              Particle Physics Data Grid.  The NSF/ITR GriPhyN project is developing the
              basic technologies required to realize a "virtual" data grid in which
              researchers from four experiments in particle and astrophysics will gain
              efficient and transparent access to distributed data and computational
              resources.
