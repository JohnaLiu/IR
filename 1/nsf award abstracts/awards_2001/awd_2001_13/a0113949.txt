Abstract    :
              This project provides for institutional development in the area of secure and
              trustworthy computer systems. It expands laboratory facilities to include a
              computer network laboratory for information assurance classes. Course materials
              in computer security and trustworthy computer networks are developed and tested
              for eventual publication and wider dissemination. A distinguished speaker
              series brings in national and international experts to the campus. Faculty
              development is provided through a variety of methods. The area of reliable and
              trustworthy systems is one of emerging national need. Many of these systems
              contain embedded computers with software and hardware providing functionality
              and controlling operations of the system. This can range from use in household
              appliances to aircraft or medical systems. This program provides expertise and
              capacity that is in our national interest and adds critical core curricular
              components to the information assurance field.
