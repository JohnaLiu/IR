Abstract    :
              Ghaboussi This project is a joint multidisciplinary industry-academia research
              effort to develop an advanced virtual reality (VR) environment for modeling
              earthmoving equipment interaction with the surrounding medium such as soil. The
              project will take advantage of rapid developments in hardware, software and
              information technology to develop a real-time virtual environment for
              machine-medium interaction that includes realistic force-feed back. The
              proposed development will enhance the design of the earthmoving equipment and
              improve the design cycle.  It will also open up new venues for application of
              VR for machine medium interaction. This project will greatly benefit from
              leveraged resources provided by Caterpillar, Inc. The research team will
              develop an original neural network (NN) based real-time soil medium model that
              can be used to simulate soil response due to manipulation by earthmoving
              equipment. The proposed model will be mechanistically accurate and run in
              real-time.  It will simulate the soil resistance and the interactive forces
              between the medium and the earthmoving equipment. The NN model will be trained
              using data sets developed from non-real time simulations using the discrete
              element method. Data sets of soil and earthmoving equipment response will also
              be developed from full-scale field tests at Caterpillar, Inc. proving ground in
              Peoria, Illinois.  The research team, in cooperation with the National Center
              for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), will implement the new NN soil model in
              Cave Automated Virtual Environment (CAVE). A new object-oriented vehicle
              prototyping system (VPS) will be developed in this virtual environment. A force
              feedback link will be developed representing the medium resistance provided by
              the NN soil model to the vehicle dynamics model. The real-time virtual
              environment will enhance the design verification tools available to the
              earthmoving equipment manufacturing industry and reduce the number of costly
              field trials for new equipment designs.  The ideas and methodology that will
              be developed for the real-time VR environment have a wide range of applications
              such as simulation of slope failures and avalanches as well as bulk and powder
              material handling in agricultural, mining and manufacturing applications. The
              proposed VR environment can potentially be used in space exploration of other
              planets where it is necessary to troubleshoot a remote controlled vehicle
              interacting with the soil medium on the planetary surface in real-time.  This
              project brings together specialists in 1) computational intelligence and soil
              medium modeling from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at
              UIUC, 2) virtual reality and computer science from NCSA at UIUC, and 3)
              earthmoving equipment design and control at Caterpillar, Inc. Close
              coordination among the team members will ensure a strong exchange of ideas
              between academia and industry. ***
