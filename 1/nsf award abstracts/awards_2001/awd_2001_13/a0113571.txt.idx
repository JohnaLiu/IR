Abstract    :
              AST-0113571 J. Stone  The product of this research will be an improved
              general purpose solver for astrophysical gas dynamics, including
              magnetohydrodynamics, self-gravity, and radiative cooling effects.  It will be
              a successor to the PI's widely used ZEUS code and will be a new generation code
              exploiting new hardware and software capabilities.   Solvers optimized for
              scalar processors able to run on distributed memory parallel machines will
              greatly enhance the range of astrophysical problems addressable with direct
              numerical simulation.  The project is interfaced to the graduate program of the
              Center for Scientific Computation and Applied Mathematical Modeling, which will
              allow hands on graduate training in numerical simulations for astrophysics and
              in use of numerical algorithms for parallel architectures.
