Abstract    :
              0113713 Williams  Subduction zones comprise a large percentage of the
              tectonic plate boundaries on earth and they produce the largest and most
              devastating earthquakes.  Large amounts of surface geodetic data are collected
              in these regions to estimate seismic hazard and to understand the mechanics of
              convergent margins.  The amount and quality of such data has increased rapidly
              in recent years but the development of sophisticated and easy-to-use modeling
              tools has not proceeded at a similar pace.  Although sophisticated modeling
              techniques exist, they are not generally easy to use and are not readily
              available to the same scientists collecting geodetic data.    This is a
              project to develop web-based tools that will provide comprehensive solutions
              for geoscientists wishing to model surface deformation at subduction zones. 
              This will allow general access to more powerful modeling techniques (the finite
              element method) while offering significant ease-of-use.  Despite the increase
              in the quality and quantity of geodetic data, most researchers still rely on
              older modeling techniques in their analyses.  The goal of this project is to
              provide a modeling environment that improves upon current methods while still
              being easy to use, thus allowing geoscientists to focus more on interpretation
              than on model development. ***
