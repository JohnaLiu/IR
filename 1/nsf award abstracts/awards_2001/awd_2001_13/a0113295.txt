Abstract    :
              The objective of the research project is the development and application of
              mathematically and computationally rigorous gradient-based optimization
              methodologies for a virtual materials process design that is based on
              quantified product quality and accounts for process targets and constraints
              including economic aspects. A framework for preform as well as process
              parameter optimization of multi-stage metal forming 
processes is considered.
              The design of each individual process is performed using gradient-optimization
              techniques that are based on an innovative continuum sensitivity analysis.
              Optimal microstructure evolution paths, ideal forming techniques and knowledge
              based expert systems are used to select the required sequence of processes and
              to develop feasible initial designs.

If successful, the computational design
              simulator under development can be applied to select the necessary sequence of
              forming and intermediate thermal-stage processes, select appropriate dies and
              preforms  and control/design the various process parameters such that, for a
              given raw material with a given initial geometry, one can obtain a final
              product with desired microstructure and shape under various
              process
constraints and with minimal utilization rates and overall cost. These
              developments will lead to a virtual process laboratory that will assist
              industry in reducing lead time for process and product development, in trimming
              the cost of an extensive experimental trial-and-error process development
              effort, in developing processes for tailored material properties and in
              increasing volume/time yield.
