Abstract    :
              This project involves the development of a web-based tool to support ad-hoc
              international workgroups interested in global/regional-scale aerosols events
              such as forest fires, dust storms, air pollution transport episodes, and
              volcanoes.  This tool will be made available to the international scientific
              community, disaster managers, and the lay public for use in detecting the
              occurrence of aerosol events, monitoring their evolution, and analyzing their
              impacts.  The web-based tool is an XML-based system designed as a standard data
              description and transmission language/protocol and is capable of receiving
              queries and delivering XML data to any other computer on the Internet.  A new
              data integration and browsing tool for exploration and presentation is being
              developed that allows the superposition of spatial and temporal data submitted
              by work group participants or generally available through the web.  Data from
              the system can be distributed among servers who subscribe to a common sharing
              standards for data and metadata.
