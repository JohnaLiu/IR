Abstract    :
              The project addresses the problem of human interaction - in this case mechanical
              interaction - with virtual environments.  Considered are locomotion interface
              energy-extractive devices that allow natural walking through virtual terrain.
              The goal is to produce a sense of immersion in the virtual world by realistic
              integration of walking with vision and sound, and by realistic energy
              expenditure in moving about. For example, the system will be expected to
              realistically recreate the fact that walking uphill is harder than downhill.
              Additional degrees of freedom will be explored to investigate a more
              generalized pattern of terrain walking.
