Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to capture physical properties of real world
              phenomenon by analyzing photographs and video.  The problem of capturing motion
              of objects has emerged as a major research area in the fields of computer
              vision and computer graphics with a wide range of possible applications.  This
              project will attempt to devise new computer vision techniques for capturing and
              modeling the dynamics and physical characteristics of a number of differing
              objects in different contexts.  If successful, the new techniques will enable
              more accurate 3D motion estimation from a single video stream and other limited
              sensor data.  Finally, the project will explore potentially valuable
              application areas for these research products.
