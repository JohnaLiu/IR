Title: Quantum Communication and Cryptography: Protocols and
              Systems

A functional quantum computer would render all public-key
              cryptographic protocols (e.g., RSA, Diffie-Hellman), used for secure
              communication over the Internet, insecure; conversely, QKD could save the
              Internet and enable secure public communication. Similarly, super-dense coding
              can potentially double the classical capacity of a channel, if the parties
              could share EPR pairs in advance.

 This project is aimed at a theoretical
              study of issues in quantum informatin processing, including (1) algorithms for
              entanglement purification and distillation, (2) Capacity results for various
              quantum channels, (3) efficient entanglement manipulation and pure state
              management via local quantum operations and classical communication (LOCC), (4)
              quantum key distribution using practical systems, and (5) novel
              informationally-secure quantum cryptographic protocols that only quantum
              systems might enable, but are not known to exist using classical cryptographic
              protocols.
