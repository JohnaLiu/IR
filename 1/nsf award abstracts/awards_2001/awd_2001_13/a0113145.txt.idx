Abstract    :
              TITLE:  BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY OF PRAIRIE DOGS PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:  JOHN L.
              HOOGLAND  Utah prairie dogs are colonial, burrowing rodents that are in acute
              danger of extinction.  Research on their ecology and social behavior at Bryce
              Canyon National Park will help conservation biologists to formulate a recovery
              plan for these rare animals.  Biologists argue about the details, but they
              all agree that individuals should avoid extreme inbreeding.  Utah prairie dogs,
              however, commonly mate with close kin such as parents, siblings and offspring. 
              Long-term research will examine the reproductive success of individuals that
              engage in extreme inbreeding.  Although infanticide is ubiquitous among
              animals, the frequency is usually low and the victims are usually genetically
              unrelated to killers.  For Utah prairie dogs, however, infanticide affects 27%
              of litters.  Further, males frequently kill the offspring of females with whom
              they copulated.  Research will investigate reasons for these unusual features
              of infanticide among Utah prairie dogs.  DNA- fingerprints indicate a
              startling result for Utah prairie dogs:  females commonly rear the offspring of
              other females.  Research will investigate whether mothers that rear foster
              offspring increase the safety of their own offspring from both infanticide and
              predation.
