Abstract    :
              This project will design and implement a distributed rendering platform that
              consists of off-the-shelf commodity components, yet delivers real-time
              photorealism on a large scale. This parallel rendering system was inspired by a
              similar system recently built at Princeton University. Proposed extensions to
              that work include a significant expansion in scale, new task-scheduling
              algorithms, a new  integrated network design that links graphics card drivers
              to network interface card drivers in distributed Linux systems, and an
              extension of the Keller technique, called instant radiosity, to deliver
              real-time, global illumination. Design and implementation of the platform
              should provide graduate students in computer science with valuable hands-on
              experience in designing large-scale systems for distributed processing. The
              resulting platform should serve as a valuable research tool for several groups 
              including the NSF ERC group, which will use visualization to explore product
              and process design for new fibers and films. The enabling code extensions, to
              widely-available open software systems that this project builds, will be freely
              available over the Internet.
