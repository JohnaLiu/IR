Abstract    :
              This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program will allow
              the University of Pittsburgh to purchase a video imaging system that will allow
              the principal investigators to follow individual particle motion and spreading
              of dyes in a 2D flowing soap film. The video system consists of a high-speed
              (1000 fps) video camera and a 5Watt solid-state laser. The latter serves as an
              intense light source for illuminating the particles and for excitation of the
              dye. The system is one of general utility and will serve to train graduate as
              well as undergraduate students in fluid dynamics and state-of-the-art
              measurement techniques. The idea of using topology to study 2D turbulence is
              entirely new and promising results just beginning to emerge. The requested
              video system will further our fundamental understanding of turbulence phenomena
              which are important for a wide range of practical problems, such as weather
              patterns, dispersion of biological agents in air and in water, chemical
              reactions, and crystal growth..  This award from the Instrumentation for
