Abstract    :
              The Department of Statistics at North Carolina State University will
purchase a
              high-performance clustered computing facility which will be
dedicated to the
              support of research in the mathematical sciences. The
equipment will be used
              for several research projects, including in
particular:   
 - Simulation
              Methods for Data Measured With Error   
 - Stochastic Models of Gene
              Regulation   
 - Spatial Modeling, Visualization and Inference   
 -
              Statistical Analysis of Large Data Sets   
 - Models of Biological Pattern
              Formation
