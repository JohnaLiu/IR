This is a project to develop and implement a web-based
              "community model"  (websim3D) for the generation, storage, and dissemination of
              ground motion simulation results.  Websim3D will initially be based on the nine
              long-period finite-difference (FD) earthquake scenario simulations carried out
              for the Los Angeles basin by the P.I.  The user-friendly access to the
              simulated ground motion time histories will allow seismologists and engineers
              to analyze the broadband synthetic ground motions for desired earthquake
              scenarios at sites of interest.

The P.I. is regarded as an authority on
              simulation of ground-motion for southern California earthquakes using the
              Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Community 3-D seismic-velocity
              model.  His prior work set the standard for this type of simulation.  Getting
              state-of-the-art ground-motion simulations for scenario earthquakes to the
              scientific and engineering community is a high priority, especially for the Los
              Angeles region of southern California, which contains 25% of the nation's
              seismic risk.
