"Improving the Education of
              Software Testers"

This is a project that lays the groundwork for significant
              improvements in the quality of academic and commercial courses in software
              testing. This is new ground since the skills used in the field are not well
              identified and there are few collections of exercises or drills designed to
              help polish those skills. Software testing is an important area of work within
              information technology, but it has been largely ignored within the educational
              community. As a result, the software industry faces a shortage of appropriately
              educated people to do this work. This project develops foundational material
              for teaching introductory and advanced classes on software testing, including:
              a collection of examples of software errors (posted on a web site,
              well-described, with screen shots, and suitable for use in class),
              identification and descriptions of specific skills involved in software testing
              (published at conferences and in articles that are available on the web), 
              sample exercises for students (for use as course assignments or for self-paced
              study) and a smaller separate collection for teachers (for possible use in
              exams), free software versions of classroom-level versions of useful testing
              tools (a "classroom version" is intended to teach the concept of that kind of
              tool, and to handle tasks that are as complex as the student might run into as
              an undergraduate), research (and reports on the results of the research) on the
              usefulness of Whittaker's software fault model as an organizing structure for
              presenting a wide range of key testing techniques in class, extension of Kaner
              & Bach's characterizations of testing styles/strategies, bringing together
              research and practitioner literature into a structure useful for presenting a
              wide range of key testing strategies in class, and workshops (and an email
              discussion group) on the teaching of software testing. The core societal
              benefit of this work lies in its high potential for improvement of software
              testing and through that, software quality.
