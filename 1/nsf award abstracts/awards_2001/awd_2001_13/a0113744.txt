Abstract    :
              The International Council for Science (ICSU) includes four unions, which focus
              on the geosciences.  These are the International Unions: of Geodesy and
              Geophysics (IUGG); for the Geological Sciences (IUGS); for Quaternary Research
              (INQUA); and for Soil Science (IUSS).  These unions play an important role in
              fostering wide international exchange and dissemination of information,
              knowledge, and ideas.  They promote strong international cooperation in the
              various  fields of geosciences  covered by these unions  and provide, through
              the participation of U.S. scientists, an important  vehicle  for broad
              dissemination of research results.  They also provide a forum in which U.S.
              geoscientists can exercise effective international leadership in areas of the
              geosciences that are especially important  from the perspective of U.S.
              science.  U.S. participation in and support for these unions is provided
              through U.S. National Committees (USNC's) for each union.    These USNC's are
              comprised of distinguished geoscientists who are well aware of  the state of
              the science, both nationally and internationally.   The UNSC's plan and
              implement U.S. participation in the unions and keep the U.S. geosciences
              community  informed of union activities.
