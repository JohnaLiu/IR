Abstract    :
              In this project the PIs will carry out a program of research and development to
              apply digital imaging techniques to the problem of low vision.  The work will
              focus on two related thrusts.   First, low vision simulation methods will be
              developed that accurately show people with normal vision what the world looks
              like to people with visual deficits.  The goal is to develop simulation tools
              that designers can use to understand the visual limitations (and abilities) of
              people with low vision and thereby eliminate barriers to access from their
              designs.   Applications in the areas of architectural design, driving safety,
              and the development of graphical user interfaces will be demonstrated.  
              Second, the PIs will develop low vision image enhancement tools that can be
              used to transform images from digital cameras or graphics applications to
              create new images that are more comprehensible to people with low vision.  The
              objective is to use computational models of low vision to develop image
              enhancement algorithms that can be incorporated into digital imaging systems to
              give people with low vision better access to the visual world.   The PIs plan
              to use these algorithms to develop two new kinds of assistive technology: image
              profiling and enhancement tools for Web browsers to enable low vision access to
              Web-based graphical information; and portable augmented vision systems that can
              facilitate orientation, mobility and object recognition for people with low
              vision.   The hope is that the methods developed will provide better
              understanding of the challenges facing people with low vision, and lead to
              effective assistive technologies that can help people with low vision live
              easier, fuller and more productive lives.
