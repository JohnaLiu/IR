Abstract    :
              This proposal expands the capacity of our current educational program already
              producing high quality graduates in information assurance primarily through 30
              fellowships and a unique support infrastructure. The broad-based program
              includes faculty from computing, engineering, political science, mathematics
              and management information systems to provide students with a broad range of
              course opportunities and career foci. As well, faculty from the education and
              library colleges help to design courses and other activities to ensure student
              success and leadership skill development. The fellowship program includes both
              undergraduate and graduate students leading to increased numbers of information
              assurance professionals.
