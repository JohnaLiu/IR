Abstract    :
              This award is made under the Information Technology Research initiative. 
              Electronic devices are the underpinning of information technology.  Present
              electronic devices are microscale in size.  This limits the switching speed at
              which information can transfer.  Nanoscale systems, including carbon nanotubes,
              have a great potential for a new generation of electronic devices with
              switching speeds a thousand times faster.  However, as the size and
              dimensionality of electronic devices approach the nanoscale, the effect of
              correlations and disorder become crucial.  Despite their importance, the
              effects of correlations and disorder remain a significant fundamental challenge
              to the physics community.  A new computational approach will be developed to
              address this problem.  The effects of disorder and correlations are now being
              studied experimentally in carbon nanotubes.  These nanotubes form the smallest
              diameter quasi-one-dimensional conductors yet produced. The rich phenomena
              which arise from correlations in nanotubes include Luttinger liquid power law
              transport observed in single-wall nanotubes, and the recently observed
              superconductivity in ropes.  The role of disorder is seen in the wide range of
              conductivities measured in metallic tubes.  The dynamical cluster
              approximation (DCA) will be further developed to simulate models of carbon
              nanotubes.  This new technique eliminates the finite-sized errors which can be
              especially large in one-dimensional systems; allows for the study of intertube
              coupling, as well as coupling to the tube environment; and, when combined with
              the Maximum Entropy Method, enables the study of the dynamical response of
              these systems.  Key objectives of the project include the development of a
              computational tool set to study strongly correlated nanotubes and, as a
              consequence, develop an understanding of the temperture dependent properties in
              the two-chain model of a single-walled nanotube; the competition between
              disorder and correlations; the superconductivity in the two-chain modle and the
              role of intertube coupling; and the effect of long-range Coulomb
              forces. %%% This award is made under the Information Technology Research
