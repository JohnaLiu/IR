Abstract    :
              Simple RNA viruses have evolved complex interactions with their host's cellular
              machinery that facilitate their replication, cell-to-cell movement, and
              systemic transport.  These interactions often lead to a disruption in the
              development and homeostasis of the host's cellular processes, resulting in the
              expression of disease symptoms that impact the host's well being and/or its
              economic value.  The goals of this project focus on the identification of host
              components that are either involved in or affected by virus replication. To
              accomplish these goals the molecular tools available for the plant virus
              Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) will be combined with the genetic tractability of
              Arabidopsis thaliana to identify novel host genes that either directly
              contribute to the virus life-cycle or are transcriptionally altered during the
              infection process.  Specific studies in this project will address three
              objectives.  1) A map-based cloning approach will be used to identify a
              previously classified Arabidopsis locus that controls the rate of TMV
              cell-to-cell movement.  Additional studies will address the function of this
              locus and its role in virus cell-to-cell movement.  2) Available microarray
              technologies will be used to identify Arabidopsis genes that are differentially
              regulated during distinct stages of the TMV infection cycle, including
              inoculated and systemically infected whole leaf tissue as well as synchronously
              infected protoplasts.  3) Symptoms displayed by TMV infected Arabidopsis will
              be used to identify Arabidopsis mutants with altered virus susceptibilities. 
              Map-based cloning strategies will then be initiated to identify the genes that
              impart these altered susceptibilities.  Overall, studies from this project
              should significantly enhance our understanding of the interactions that occur
              between viruses and their hosts.
