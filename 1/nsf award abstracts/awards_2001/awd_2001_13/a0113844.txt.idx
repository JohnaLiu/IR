Abstract    :
              The recently demonstrated techniques of photon state storage in collective
              matter excitations will be used to investigate methods for manipulation of
              quantum information.  The specific aims are (1) experimental study of efficient
              transfer of quantum information between light fields and long-lived collective
              states of alkali atoms, (2) theoretical studies of quantum information
              processing based on collective states, and (3) theoretical study of the optical
              manipulation of solid-state qubits.
