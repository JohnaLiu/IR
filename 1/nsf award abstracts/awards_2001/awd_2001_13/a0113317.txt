Abstract    :
              Title:			 ITR Award: Creating One to One Learning Opportunities across the
              Internet

We will study a new kind of "anytime" learning system, based on one
              to one peer interactions shielded by and facilitated on the Internet. Our
              pedagogical hypothesis is that students learn best when continually challenged
              in a diverse environment. Matching students with appropriate learning partners
              and curricular material can be done with today's Internet technology and peer
              to peer software. Existing technologies from  machine learning and game theory
              - specifically those related to mediocrity as an equilibrium phenomenon in self
              organizing systems - will be implemented as practical technologies that can
              adapt automatically as students learn. The technology is based on simple
              techniques to bring humans together to learn, rather than domain-intensive
              knowledge-based tutoring of a single human, and can work with the existing
              technology infrastructure of most public schools. Internet multi-player gaming
              environments have been proven to scale to millions of users, as well as having
              high intrinsic motivation. The research incorporates  fundamental research in
              Information Technology, sound experimental research on motivation in
              multi-player games, and a novel and scaleable distributed community for
              learning.
