Abstract    :
              This program establishes a scholarship program for computer science graduate
              students specializing in information assurance. Upon graduation, the students
              participate in two years of federal service. The program of study is a
              dual-track masters program, leading to either a master's degree in computer
              sciences or an interdisciplinary master's degree with specialization in
              information security. Students in both tracks receive special attention in
              seminar and advising sessions to help them understand the context and role of
              information security in today's society. This includes regular presentations by
              leaders in commerce, academia, and government. Students have the opportunity to
              participate in leading-edge research projects conducted by faculty. Through
              this program students receive a valuable educational background in information
              security and assurance, obtain hands-on research experience, gain perspective
              on industry and research trends, and provide valuable service to the government
              while experiencing real-world problems.
