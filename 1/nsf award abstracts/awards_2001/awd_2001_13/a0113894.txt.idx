Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department of Minnesota University (MU) is supported by the
              Chemistry Division, and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities under
              the "Research Sites for Educators in Chemistry" (RSEC) program.  Dr. Jeffrey
              Roberts is the Principal Investigator.  The Minnesota RSEC program will be
              oriented around four interdisciplinary areas: chemical biology, computational
              chemistry, environmental chemistry, and materials chemistry.  The RSEC will
              support a broad range of collective modes, from standard sabbatical visits, to
              distance-collaborations with faculty and undergraduates from nearby colleges,
              to group visits involving three or more faculty from a single department. An
              Executive Committee consisting of Two University of Minnesota chemistry
              professors and two professors from undergraduate institutions will assist
              Dr.Roberts. Plans are for the RSEC leadership team to recruit a group of
              approximately 20 undergraduate chemistry departments as RSEC participants.  The
              program will draw from institutions in the upper Midwest. The assessment and
              evaluation of the program will be facilitated by an Advisory Committee of five
              faculty form both UM and small-school departments.   Research Sites for
              Educators in Chemistry bring together the faculty of participating two-year
              colleges, baccalaureate colleges, and master's universities with faculty at
              research universities within a geographic region, to enhance the research and
              educational opportunities at all participants.  Academic and research
              institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may concurrently
              assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students, and where all
              can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the excitement of
              discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learning perspectives. 
              RSECs such as this one at the University of Minnesota provide mechanisms for
              disseminating the knowledge, skill, practices and ethics of research to a
              broader community, including those from underrepresented groups; assist in
              developing viable, sustainable research programs at participating institutions;
              and involve faculty and students at the participating institutions with a
              broader cross-section of faculty and students.
