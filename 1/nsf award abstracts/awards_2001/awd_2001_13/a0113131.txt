The
              goals of this project are to develop algorithms and prototype software for the
              verification and supervision of hybrid embedded control systems; also for the
              identification of hybrid system models.  This project is developing supervisory
              processors to supervise and control in real time the operation of large number
              of control processors interacting with the outside world. The control
              processors interact with the physical world while the supervisory processors
              are responsible for monitoring and maintaining the health of the
distributed
              control system in a highly autonomous and fault-tolerant manner.  The
              innovative characteristics of this project are as follows: 1) the development
              and application of novel discrete event supervisory methods to supervise hybrid
              embedded systems; 2) the development and application of novel approaches to the
              verification and supervision of hybrid, piece-wise linear systems; 3) the
              development of theory and algorithms to extend these results to a class of
              nonlinear hybrid systems; and, 4) the development of novel
model
              identification methodologies and algorithms for hybrid systems. The project's
              approach will improve the ability of hybrid embedded control systems to deal
              with high complexity, undecidability and nonlinearity.
