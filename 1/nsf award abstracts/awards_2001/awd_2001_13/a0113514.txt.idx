Abstract    :
              This is an award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program in DMR
              to Northwestern University. The award is for the acquisition of a controlled
              stress rheometer to support a wide array of research at Northwestern University
              on polymer materials and other complex fluids.  The proposed instrument will be
              housed in a central polymer characterization facility, replacing aging
              equipment with limited capabilities.  In addition, it will provide entirely new
              capabilities for controlled stress testing (such as creep/recovery experiments)
              that have never been available to the Northwestern community, and that are of
              significant potential value for the classes of materials under study by the
              major users of the instrument.  In addition to its use in research, the
              instrument will be used extensively for lab experiments and student projects in
              a regularly scheduled course on polymer viscoelasticity and flow. The
              instrument will serve the diverse needs of several faculty members who are
              presently pursuing research projects that require extensive rheological
              testing.  These include (i) studies of flow-induced structural changes in
              ordered polymeric and surfactant fluids; (ii) studies of block-copolymer gels
              that provide a matrix for highly filled gel systems with applications in
              ceramic processing; (iii) thermoresponsive polymer solutions and microgels
              under development as matrices for advanced biopolymer separations in
              microchannel devices; and (iv) a variety of functionalized polymer gels and
              networks for biomaterials applications.  In addition to the primary user
              community, there are several other Northwestern faculty members who are likely
              to take advantage of this facility intermittently for miscellaneous polymer &
              fluid characterization needs. %%% This award from the Instrumentation for
              Materials Research program in DMR supports the acquisition of a rheometer at
              Northwestern University. 'Rheology' is the study of the flow properties of
              so-called complex fluids, and the primary instrumentation used for such
              research are rheometers, which measure the flow behavior of such complicated
              materials under well-defined conditions. Many technologically important
              materials defy simple classification as either solids or liquids. Instead,
              their flow properties are more complicated, frequently combining elements of
              both solid and liquid character. Familiar examples from everyday life include
              food products such as egg whites or mayonnaise, consumer products such as
              toothpaste, lotions, and adhesives, and biological fluids. The new rheometer
              will serve a broad community of materials researchers at Northwestern
              University. Some areas of research that will benefit from this new
              instrumentation include:  1. Studies of flow-induced structural changes in
              ordered polymeric and surfactant fluids. 2. Studies of block-copolymer gels
              that provide a matrix for highly filled gel systems with applications in
              ceramic processing. 3. Thermoresponsive polymer solutions and microgels under
              development as matrices for advanced biopolymer separations in microchannel
              devices. 4. Functionalized polymer gels and networks for biomaterials
              applications.  New materials for tissue engineering and drug delivery are being
              synthesized with 'bio-mimetic' approaches-designed to simulated nature's
              strategies for gel and network formation.
