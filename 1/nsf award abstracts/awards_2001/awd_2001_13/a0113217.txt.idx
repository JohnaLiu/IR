Abstract    :
              The process of designing or upgrading a large-scale broadband communication
              infrastructure involves solving several optimization problems, including the
              problems of optimum topology design, server placement, distribution and
              replication of data between the servers, and fair division of limited network
              resources (e.g. bandwidth, CPU cycles, etc.) among the users. As networks
              become larger and more complicated, it becomes imperative to use
              mathematically sound, scalable methods for solving the above problems. The
              goal of this project is to develop and implement such methods.  One of the
              main thrusts of the project is development of new approaches for network
              design and sizing. In particular, the project focuses on development of
              optimization techniques where the goal is to construct a low cost topology,
              choose optimum locations (and sizes) for servers (e.g. web caches, application
              servers, wireless hubs, etc.), and decide how to replicated the data.  A
              related problem is network expansion/augmentation, where the goal is to decide
              (online) where to place new equipment and to choose which new links to lease
              in order to satisfy the increased demand. Due to economies of scale, topology
              design and augmentation problems have concave costs structure and hence can
              not be solved by classical flow-based approaches. The investigators work
              on developing principled approaches for solving the above problems and
              on designing and implementing a set of tools that can be used in the planning
              and network management process.
