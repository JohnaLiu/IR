              ABSTRACT SES 0113665 Paul Josephson, Colby College Industrialized Nature:
              Brute Force Technology and the Scientific Management of Nature  Based on an
              innovative approach to the analysis of notions of sustainable development at
              the juncture of history of technology and environmental history, this project
              examines comparative issues of scientific management of natural resources in
              the Soviet Union and Russia, Norway, the United States, Canada  and Brazil. 
              The central task of this historical survey is to track the evolution of
              "brute-force" technology in these countries from the 1930s through the present.
               The focus falls on water, fish, and forest resources. The study identifies the
              challenges in adopting sustainable resource management techniques, designing
              appropriate technologies, and providing adequate resources for all citizens. 
                Four case studies pursue the surprising richness and similarity of the
              subjects (in terms of research strategies, biological affinities, political and
              economic pressures. The first cases compares a massive Stalinist project to
              transform the Volga River basin into a unified transport, irrigation, and
              hydroelectric power system, with the taming of the Columbia River basin in
              Washington state.  A second case study considers the Soviet conquest of Siberia
              and the so-called Angara-Enesei cascade in comparison with the development of
              Amazonia. The third study explores the role of scientific research in promoting
              brute force technology in the Norway and Soviet deep sea fishing industries. 
              The final case study focuses on the forests of Arkhangelsk region of northwest
              Russia and the northern forest of New Hampshire and Maine.  National politics,
              economics, culture, and science and engineering have had an impact on the
              genesis of scientific management and brute force technology.  The study
              evaluates the impact these national features in shaping notions of scientific
              management of natural resources, and nature itself.   It also describes the
              roots of the tendency to replace biological paradigms with industrial ones in
              which scientists treat nature as an efficient machine of monocultures, and look
              closely at the design of the technologies that powered the machine. In natural
              resource management, the driving force has been the effort to determine where
              production and biology meet. Cross-national comparisons will indicate what
              aspects of resource management are universal and what aspects reflect national
              determinants -- economic, political, social, ideological -- of scientific
              activity.
