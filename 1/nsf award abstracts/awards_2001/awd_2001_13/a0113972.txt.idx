Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Department of Wichita State University (WSU) is supported by the
              Chemistry Division, the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and EPSCOR
              under the "Research Sites for Educators in Chemistry" (RSEC) program.  Dr. D.
              Paul Rillema is the Principal Investigator.  The Wichita State RSEC program
              will focus its attention on some 30 two- and four- year institutions via the
              development of research collaborations. A minimum of two faculty from
              institutions will receive support to spend one or two semesters and a summer at
              WSU doing research.  A second component of the Wichita State RSEC is a program
              of teaching postdoctoral fellows who will be involved in research and trained
              for teaching in two- or four-year institutions.  The training will be provided
              by a team of WSU Faculty and the two- and four-year faculty participants.  The
              teaching postdoctoral fellows will teach one course per semester under the
              guidance of a WSU faculty member and from a two- or four-year institution
              faculty participant.  The faculty participants will also invite one promising
              student from their institution to work alongside them as team members in the
              laboratory during the summer thus facilitating the continued functioning of the
              team at their home institutions.  Finally, each teaching postdoctoral fellow
              will select an undergraduate student either from WSU or a two- or four-year
              institution to learn the ropes of directing undergraduate students in
              research.  Research Sites for Educators in Chemistry bring together the
              faculty of participating two-year colleges, baccalaureate colleges, and
              master's universities with faculty at research universities within a geographic
              region to enhance the research and educational opportunities at all Academic
              and research institutions provide abundant opportunities where individuals may
              concurrently assume responsibilities as researchers, educators, and students,
              and where all can engage in joint efforts that infuse education with the
              excitement of discovery and enrich research through the diversity of learner
              perspectives.  RSECs such as this one at Wichita State University provide
              mechanisms for disseminating the knowledge, skill, practices and ethics of
              research to a broader community, including those from underrepresented groups;
              assist in developing viable, sustainable research programs at participating
              institutions; and involve faculty and students at the participating
              institutions with a broader cross-section of faculty and students .
