Abstract    :
              Julia Fulghum and Javed Khan of Kent State University are supported by the
              Division of Chemistry under the Information Technology Research (ITR) program
              to create new methods for the non-destructive, three-dimensional
              characterization of heterogeneous, solid polymeric materials.  Data will be
              acquired from polymer samples of increasing complexity using a variety of
              analytical techniques, including x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
              time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and Fourier transform infrared
              spectroscopy.  All of these methods can be used to obtain chemical information
              from different sample volumes, and to generate multidimensional data sets. 
              Multivariate statistical analysis and classification methods will be used to
              enhance interpretation of the acquired data sets, ultimately enabling creation
              of a unified polymer framework, called an active knowledge mesh.  The combined
              system will create synergy between the computer and the user in large and
              complex information space exploration, posing interesting challenges for
              multi-modal data analysis and its multi-perspective visualization.  Polymers
              are widely used in a variety of high technology applications.  For example,
              many current and proposed biomaterials are polymers, and polymers are contained
              as well in composites used for a light aircraft and automobiles.  Commercially
              important materials often involve molecularly complex polymer blends whose
              surface chemistry and structure are particularly challenging to analyze. 
              Outcomes from this project are expected to improve the understanding and
              evaluation of complex polymer blend characteristics, and ultimately enable
              enhanced control of technologically important materials properties.
