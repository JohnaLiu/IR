Self-assembly
              of nanoparticles in 2-D and 3-D structures continues to receive considerable
              attention due to the potentially unique optical and electronic properties that
              can be achieved.   The proposed work is on a variety of experimental and
              computational simulation methods to study the rate of surface diffusion and
              formation of the 2-D gold nanoparticles.  The thin layer will first be formed
              with a droplet, and later in the project with a spin-coater for this study.  A
              number of techniques, such as small angle neutron scattering, atomic force
              microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and quasi-elastic light scattering are
              proposed for this study.  The computational simulations based on molecular
              dynamic simulations for single and two-particle interaction followed by large
              scale Brownian Dynamic simulations are proposed.
