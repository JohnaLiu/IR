Abstract    :
              The waters and soils of our environment contain naturally-occurring organic
              matter (NOM), which helps to regulate soil fertility, pollutant toxicity,
              ecosystem behavior and carbon cycling.  These in turn affect agricultural
              production, public and ecosystem health, and global climate change.  However,
              the processes which produce NOM from plant and animal matter are poorly
              understood, due to the complex nature of NOM and the multitude of possible
              reactions in the environment.   This project will combine the efforts of
              ecologists, geochemists and computer scientists in an attempt to model this
              complex system using a novel stochastic approach.  In this approach, millions
              of individual molecules are simulated and reacted together 'in silico' to
              provide a computer model of the complex natural processes.  The model will be
              developed and tested via an internet collaboration, and ultimately will be
              accessible to agricultural, environmental and earth scientists via a simple web
              browser interface.
