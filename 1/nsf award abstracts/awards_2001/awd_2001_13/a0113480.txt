This grant, supported through funds from both the
              NSF/Information Technology Research - Small Grants Program and the Earth
              Science Instrumentation and Facilities Program, will facilitate the development
              of the software infrastructure necessary to fully exploit the scientific
              potential of high-resolution X-ray computed tomographic (CT) data for
              geological research. Over our four years of experience in operating a
              high-resolution X-ray CT scanner dedicated to the geosciences at the University
              of Texas, we have identified the types of quantitative analysis whose necessity
              arises repeatedly in addressing research questions. These include identifying,
              separating, and characterizing up to thousands of individual objects within a
              scan volume, quantifying three-dimensional fabrics and textures, and measuring
              local and dispersed volume properties such as fracture apertures and porosity.
              We have laid the foundation for progress in each of these areas by developing
              algorithms and complete software applications in support of some of our joint
              research projects with outside investigators. We propose to build upon this
              foundation by expanding and generalizing these programming efforts, creating a
              suite of tools that will greatly expand the value and utility of CT data, as
              well as any other volumetric data set. Graduate research projects will provide
              the setting in which these tools are applied and tested.
