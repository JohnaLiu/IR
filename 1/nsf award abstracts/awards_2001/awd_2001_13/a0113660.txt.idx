Abstract    :
              Disk systems have long been a source of performance and management problems,
              and they grow in importance as the years pass.  Of particular concern are the
              slow-to-improve mechanical positioning delays.  To address these problems,
              storage devices and host systems have abundant resources and knowledge. 
              Independently, engineers of both device firmware and operating system (OS)
              software aggressively utilize their local knowledge and resources to mitigate
              disk performance problems. The overall goal of this research is to increase
              the cooperation between these two sets of engineers, which will increase
              the end-to-end performance and robustness of computer systems.  This
              research will develop a deep understanding of available device and workload
              information and how it can be collectively exploited. Exploiting this
              understanding in real systems will require more expressive interfaces and new
              cooperative algorithms.  Two concrete examples to be explored are: (1)
              device-side specializations, such as freeblock scheduling, that have access to
              system-provided information about priority levels and forthcoming demands,
              and (2) OS-side specializations, such as track-aligned extents, that have
              access to device-provided details about physical data layout and firmware
              cache algorithms.  In addition, the insights generated by this research will
              assist end-to-end education and thinking in storage systems.
