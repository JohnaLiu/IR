Abstract    :
              Abstract CTS-0113206 R. Lucht, Texas A&M University  Components are acquired
              for development of a tunable, high-resolution optical parametric oscillator
              (OPO) laser source.  The system features a resonant, electronically locked
              ring-oscillator cavity that is injection-seeded with tunable diode laser
              radiation.  The pump source  for the OPO system is a Q-switched
              injection-seeded Nd:YAG laser.  In addition to serving as the  pump source for
              the OPO cavity, the fundamental (1064 nm) and harmonic (532 nm, 355 nm, and
               266 nm) laser radiation from the YAG laser is used in sum-frequency
              generation (SFG)  processes to convert the near infrared output of the OPO
              into visible or ultraviolet radiation.  This  source will greatly improve
              applicability and accuracy  of a wide variety of laser diagnostic  techniques.
               Specific examples include ultraviolet polarization spectroscopy (PS) of
              hydroxyl and  nitric oxide, amplified stimulated emission (ASE) of the carbon
              atom, and coherent anti-Stokes  Raman scattering (CARS) of the hydrogen
              molecule.
