Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
              FY2001.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
              protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
              not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
              opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
              microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
              established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
              research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
              fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
              research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
              of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
              locations. 

The research and training plan is entitled "Coevolution at the
              genomic level of aphids and their bacterial endosymbionts."  An ancient
              association between the aphid, Melaphis rhois, and its bacterial endosymbiont,
              Buchnera aphidicola, has produced an obligate mutualism in which symbionts
              provide essential amino acids to their hosts. Buchnera gene expression patterns
              over the course of the host complex life cycle are being characterized using
              microarray technology.
