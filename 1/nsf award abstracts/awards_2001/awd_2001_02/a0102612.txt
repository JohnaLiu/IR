This
              proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation "Nanoscale Science and
              Engineering" (NSF 00-119).  New multi-scale modeling approaches will be applied
              to novel nanoporous materials for selective oxidation catalysts.  Linkages will
              be developed to permit the modeling of both physical processes and chemical
              interactions.  State-of-the-art embedded cluster quantum chemical methods will
              be interfaced with iterative quantum/classical calculations.  Continuum,
              atomistic, and quantum descriptions will be linked to yield a general
              description of the behavior of the reactive system   Electronic information
              will be incorporated into the statistical mechanical simulations through a
              novel development of the Fukui function.  Enhancement of microkinetic reaction
              modeling will be coupled with mass transfer effects.  The multiscale model will
              be applied to new mesoporous "artificial enzymes," resembling molecular squares
              and composed of zinc porphyrin walls, rhenium corners, and a manganese
              porphyrin catalyst.  Stable, nanoscale cavity environments will be synthesized 
              and organized through self-assembly.  Through the modeling effort new
              catalysts, based on these materials, will be designed.  Model reactions to be
              studied are the epoxidations of olefins. This modeling work has the potential
              to guide the design of catalysts capable of mimicking biological processes and
              performing enantioselective syntheses.
