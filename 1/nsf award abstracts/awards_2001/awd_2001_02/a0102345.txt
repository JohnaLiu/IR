Abstract    :
              This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019.   A novel approach for 
              the fabrication of atomistic electronic devices  is proposed which, if
              realized, will have important industrial  applications. The theoretical methods
              involve simulations using   quantum tight-binding molecular dynamics scheme
              that can be used to   accurately treat interactions in carbon systems at the
              nanoscale  level. Large scale simulations will be performed using novel 
              parallel computer algorithms using a synergistic interdisciplinary 
              collaboration. Simulation results can be used as a guide in the  experimental
              investigations.

Although the present electronic technology is dominated by
              silicon,  it is becoming clear that Si based electronic devices cannot be 
              relied on to sustain the current pace of miniaturization. It is
becoming clear
              that a new class of molecularly perfect materials are needed to make these new
              devices.  Single-wall carbon nanotubes are  one such material that are expected
              to execute a ``quantum'' leap i  the area of nanoscale electronics, computers,
              and materials.   A  focussed effort to lay the foundation for fullerene and
              nanotube based molecular electronics which  will revolutionize the electronics
              and computer industries is proposed. The  emphasis is on the modeling and
              simulations which will be used to guide experimental efforts to realize these
              devices.  The theoretical method for the treatment of these systems contains
              many state-of-the-art features, making it ideally suited for studying  these
              systems.
