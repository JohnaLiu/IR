This
              proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF 00-119.  The aim of the proposal
              is to develop nanostructured catalysts for gas-liquid reactions, which have a
              system of macro-pores designed to take advantage of oscillatory convection that
              can be created by large-scale hydrodynamic disturbances.  It is expected that
              the efficiency of the reactor would be improved by such a combination.
