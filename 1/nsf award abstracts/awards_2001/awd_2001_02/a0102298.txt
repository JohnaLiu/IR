The main tool for most of the proposed projects
              is a 
particularly adapted theory of holomorphic curves, 
which has been
              developed by Dr. Hofer and his co-workers 
in recent years. The fact, that
              there is such a close, 
but completely  unexpected, relationship between some
              
important class of dynamical systems and a  suitable 
theory of holomorphic
              curves has deep implications. 
Immediately it makes it, in principle, feasible
              to 
relate questions about large classes of dynamical 
systems to recent
              mathematical theories like quantum 
cohomology,  Gromov-Witten invariants, and
              in low 
dimensions even to Seiberg-Witten invariants. One of the 
main goals
              of this project will be the development of a 
mathematical machinery for
              constructing global surfaces 
of section for three-dimensional Reeb flows and
              
generalizations thereof.  In practice this means that 
the study of certain
              three-dimensional dynamical system 
can effectively be reduced to two
              dimensions.   The other 
goal is the development of a symplectic field theory.
              
Particular cases of such a theory are Gromov-Witten 
invariants and Floer
              Homology.  

Many physical systems like the flow of an incompressible
ideal
              fluid, the movement of a satellite under the 
gravitational forces of
              celestial bodies, or the 
movement of charged particles in a magnetic field,
              
to name a few, are examples of so called dynamical systems. 
The
              mathematical theory of dynamical systems provides 
tools to understand their
              complex behavior and allows
to make predictions. The particular examples
              mentioned 
above are of so-called Hamiltonian nature. For such systems,
              
beginning with the work of Lagrange and Hamilton, 
geometric tools have been
              developed leading to the 
modern theory of contact and symplectic geometry.
              These 
geometries play a central role in connecting mathematical 
areas like
              dynamical systems, algebraic geometry and 
smooth topology. This makes it
              possible to employ powerful 
tools from different mathematical areas in the
              study of 
important classes of dynamical systems and also to use 
ideas from
              dynamical systems to study important intrinsic 
questions in other fields by
              new methods.
