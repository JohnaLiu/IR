Abstract    :
              This proposal is for the study of electric field effects on meteor trails in the
              equatorial region.  Additionally, the PIs seek to understand any deviation of
              the radar scattering properties of a meteor trail from traditional specular
              reflection processes.

These scientific goals require the upgrade and
              continued operation of an existing meteor radar at Piura, Peru (5S, 81W). The
              upgrade at this site consists of installing a complete all-sky meteor radar
              system, so that the angle-of-arrival of meteoric backscatter can be
              unambiguously determined. In addition, archive data from Christmas Island will
              be analyzed for meteor winds as well. As a byproduct of this work routine mean
              wind, tidal amplitudes and phases, and meteor decay statistics will be
              available to the scientific community via a web server.
