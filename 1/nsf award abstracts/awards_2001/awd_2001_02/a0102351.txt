Abstract    :
              The Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division supports this award to
              Northwestern University to design, synthesize and develop novel multifunctional
              fluorophores that combine fast unidirectional internal photoinduced electron
              transfer with efficient fluorescence from the charge-separated species. With
              this award, Professor Michael Wasielewski will study molecular structural
              features to tailor optical and electronic properties of these materials as
              desired.  Molecular design incorporating perylene derivatives will be used to
              design molecular switches for potential applications in molecular devices.
              Graduate students will greatly benefit from training and research opportunities
              provided by this award in materials chemistry and in photophysical property
              characterization of materials.

With this award, ultra fast optical gating of
              electrons in synthetic molecular entities will be studied using
              photoexcitation.  Molecules will be designed, synthesized and derivatives
              incorporated, and these molecules will be characterized by time-resolved
              femtosecond laser spectroscopic methods.  Design of molecular switches with
              potential application in molecular devices will be one of the out come of these
              studies.  Students will greatly benefit from training and research
              opportunities provided by this award in materials chemistry, and in
              characterization of photophysical properties of materials.
