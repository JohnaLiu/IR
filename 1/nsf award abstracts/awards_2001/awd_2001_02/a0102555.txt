With support from NSF, the SUNY College of Environmental
              Science and Forestry will provide an intensive academic experience of
              mentoring, research and community outreach to 32 students from traditionally
              underrepresented groups. The goals of the project are to provide students with
              a meaningful independent research opportunity that may stimulate pursuit of
              graduate study and a career in environmental biology. The program is designed
              to expose students to the range of scientific career opportunities and to offer
              preparation and encouragement for pursuit of those opportunities. The program
              explicitly incorporates multicultural perspectives into the research theme in
              order to enhance cross-cultural competence in the academic community. The
              unifying theme of the program is Biodiversity Conservation. Through a 2-year
              sequence of seminars, field research and opportunities for international
              travel, students will gain expertise in the concepts, skills and career
              opportunities in the science of biodiversity.

Biodiversity research is
              recognized as a critical area of investigation by federal and international
              agencies.  The accelerating rate of species loss and the increasing impact of
              humans on global ecosystems provides urgency to the complex task of conserving
              biodiversity. All over the world, conservation biologists and policy makers are
              realizing the importance of incorporating local and indigenous knowledge into
              conservation efforts. Cross-cultural competence thus becomes an important
              component of functioning effectively in the global scientific community.
