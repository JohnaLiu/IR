This well integrated Research for Undergraduate Institutions
              (RUI) proposal aims to produce new metal phosphorous chalcogenides displaying
              nonlinear optical activity, and to integrate education objectives with the
              research by bringing to the curiculum topics such as solid state chemistry and
              nonlinear optics  not normally covered in the traditional undergraduate
              chemistry degree program.

Among the materials to be synthesized and
              characterized are new films of nonlinear optical materials based on the
              chemistry of metal hexathiohypophosphates. These materials are relevant to
              applications areas that include optical data storage and optical communications
              technologies. The educational benefits include a better understanding at the
              undergraduate level of scientific and technological issues facing society.
