Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funding for carrying out partial support for young
              physicists to attend a six-day lecture/workshop at Vanderbilt University on
              subjects related to cosmology/astrophysics, nuclear, and particle physics.  
              The subjects raised are related to each other and will be addressed by experts
              in their respective fields.
