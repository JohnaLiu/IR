The Undergraduate Mentorships in Environmental Biology
              (UMEB) Program at the University of New Mexico will provide research training
              experiences across a range of ecological studies involving biology, ecology,
              and meteorology in the Rio Grande Basin of New Mexico.  The UMEB Program will
              collaborate with faculty researchers in the Sevilleta Long Term Ecological
              Research Program (LTER) and the Museum of Southwestern Biology (MSB).  The
              goals of the UMEB program are: (1) instruct undergraduates in the principles of
              scientific research, (2) expose the students to a wide variety of ecological
              research techniques and career opportunities, (3) facilitate individual student
              research projects, and (4) encourage students to continue their scientific
              education in upper-division courses and graduate school.  Emphasis in student
              recruitment will ensure high participation by students from underrepresented
              ethnic groups.  
These activities will provide training in theoretical and
              technical aspects of ecological research, and promote a holistic approach to
              large-scale ecological studies.  

The UMEB program will contribute to four
              significant areas of research training in the United States:  (1)  Assist in
              counteracting current and anticipated shortages of Ph.D.'s for teaching at
              colleges and universities and conducting research in the national interest; (2)
              increase the ethnic diversity of students entering the ranks of professional
              scientists in the field of Environmental Biology;  (3) provide students with
              essential information regarding graduate school program selection and
              enrollment; and (4) facilitate hands-on research experiences for undergraduate
              minority students, so as to prepare these students for the demands of graduate
              school and professional scientific careers.
