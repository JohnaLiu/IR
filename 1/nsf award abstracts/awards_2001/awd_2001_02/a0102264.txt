Impact of
              Information Technology on the Future of the Research University  
    

This
              is a workshop proposal to consider research university responses to new
              challenges and opportunities presented by information technology with a focus
              on the need for future policies to ensure the evolving research enterprise will
              be capable of addressing national needs.  The results of the workshop will be
              broadly disseminated.  Participants include members of diverse constituencies: 
              early faculty adopters in innovative uses of information technology,
              intellectual and administrative university leaders, and representatives of
              government and the private sector.
