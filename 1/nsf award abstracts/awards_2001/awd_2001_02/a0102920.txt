Abstract    :
              The purpose of this proposal is to enhance the partnership between the National
              Science Foundation (NSF) and the graduate community by creating a new mechanism
              for ongoing and substantive communications between senior administrators at our
              universities providing graduate education and the NSF.  Based on the model of
              the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) Dean in Residence Program, we propose to
              establish a NSF/CGS Dean in Residence.  Selected through a national competition
              developed and administered by the Council of Graduate Schools, the NSF-CGS Dean
              in Residence, would interact with program officers in the Division of Graduate
              Education (DGE) and in other divisions of the Directorate for Eduction and
              Human Resources, with program officers and managers in the research
              directorates at NSF, as well as with senior officials at the National Science
              Foundation.  Working though CGS the dean would, in turn, share with the
              graduate dean community and with the broader science and engineering faculty
              NSF's perspective on graduate education, particularly but not exclusively those
              aspects of graduate education that NSF is attempting to strengthen or redirect
              through its portfolio.  The program will serve as a national model that could
              be adopted by other federal agencies in the future.
