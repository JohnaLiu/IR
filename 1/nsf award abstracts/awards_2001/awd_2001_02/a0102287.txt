Abstract    :
              With support of this planning grant, Russell Donnelly, Professor of Physics and
              Director of the Cryogenic Helium Turbulence Laboratory at the University of
              Oregon, Eugene,  is developing a four-part television series on low-temperature
              physics.  Based on Tom Shachtman's 1999 book of the same title, the series will
              explore the field's key concepts, the significant individuals and events in its
              history, its impact on society through such technologies as air conditioning,
              refrigeration and liquefied gases, and its promise for the future.  Shachtman
              will be the principal writer for the project, and Donnelly and Shachtman will
              work closely with television producers Meredith Burch and Steve Lyons, formerly
              a producer for NOVA.  Barbara Flagg will conduct front-end evaluation during
              the planning phase.

Activities to be conducted during the planning phase
              include:

Preliminary evaluation of audience knowledge
Consultations and
              meetings with advisors
Development of detailed content outlines for the four
              programs
Exploration of means to enhance the impact of the project through
              ancillary materials and outreach      

Assessment will include an
              investigation of the potential for adapting the content to other media such as
              design of a traveling exhibit, development of a Spanish-language radio version,
              production of "mini-films' for use on children's cable television, and
              publication of specialized print media.
