This award provides partial
              support for participants to attend
the meeting `Geometric Microlocal Analysis:
              a conference in honor
of Richard Melrose' to be held at the Massachusetts
              Institute of
Technology, March 29-31, 2002.

The speakers at the conference
              will be distinguished mathematicians
working in Melrose's wide-ranging fields
              of interest.
The primary need for the conference is the otherwise
              unavailable
opportunity to gather together specialists from many different
              areas who
would normally have little contact, but who all have ties
              to
Professor Melrose. In particular, inviting experts with connections
to
              Melrose's fields of interest, but whose work often has a different
emphasis
              and uses different methods, provides an unprecedented opportunity
for the
              synthesis of these ideas.
The tentative list of the main speakers, who will
              deliver one-hour lectures,
consist of Michael Atiyah, Nicolas Burq, Charlie
              Epstein,
Charles Fefferman, Lars Hormander, Victor Ivrii, Gilles Lebeau, John
              Lott,
Peter Sarnak, Johannes Sjostrand, Terence Tao, Daniel Tataru,
Michael
              Taylor, Gunther Uhlmann, Steve Zelditch. The schedule is not
expected to be
              crowded so that there will be plenty of time for discussions
between all the
              participants.
