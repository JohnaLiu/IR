              ABSTRACT 


NSF Proposal #0102648 

Combined NIL and ESA Processing of
              Electro-Optic Materials 

Richard O. Claus, Virginia Tech, PI 

This NSF
              NER program will study polymer/dielectric nanocomposites with enhanced
              electro-optical modulation efficiency and thermal stability, by using a
              combination of electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) facilities at Virginia Tech
              and nanoimprint lithography (NIL) facilities at the University of Michigan. We
              will use NIL to create a base nanopatterned template and ESA to fill in the
              template through the molecular-level assembly of dipolar molecules. This
              combination of approaches would allow the potentially low-cost manufacturing of
              optical and electro-optic materials and devices. The program will allow us to
              explore fundamental issues involving nanopatterning, molecular alignment, and
              structure/property relationships in resulting prototype device materials.
