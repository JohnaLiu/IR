Abstract    :
              This project explores the role of balanced information diets in information
              filtering. Information filtering is an increasingly important response to the
              problem of information overload. Community-based information filters are
              particularly beneficial because they can they can strengthen communities and
              recognize community tastes. The goal of this project is to investigate the
              benefits that can be realized by having the information filter balance the
              information presented to the user across the available topics. The project will
              explore how people forage in information abundance, what interfaces best
              support balanced information diets, and how much users like balanced
              information filters. The results will be interfaces to information through
              which users will receive the right amount of information on each topic,
              according to their interest in that topic. The information filter will learn
              which of the disparate sources of information are best for which topics, and
              present articles from the best sources. The research will also explore the
              effect of balanced information filtering on communities. The result will be
              balanced information filters that strengthen communities by ensuring sufficient
              overlap in information diets among community members.
