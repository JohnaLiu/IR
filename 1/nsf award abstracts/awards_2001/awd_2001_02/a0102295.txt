Abstract    :
              Howard University seeks funding for a three-year Teacher Retention and Renewal
              project for 180 middle school and high school teachers in Washington, DC,
              public schools.  The project will develop teacher leaders with advanced skills
              and understanding in Science, Mathematics and Technology (SMT) education
              content and pedagogy who will help strengthen ongoing professional development
              in schools through the mentoring of other training courses for teachers in life
              science, earth science, biology, chemistry and physics.  Scientists and science
              educators will teach the courses.  The courses will be grounded in
              constructivist learning theory and the activities will be interdisciplinary and
              inquiry-based.  The teachers will receive graduate credit.
