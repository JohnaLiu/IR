Abstract    :
              Funding is provided for an education and planning workshop under the MARGINS
              initiative to be held in March 2001 on the Red Sea.  Red Sea and Gulf of Suez
              area is one of the two chosen "focus" areas selected by the MARGINS community
              to study the fundamental processes of rupturing continental lithosphere to form
              new ocean basins.  The workshop will be held in Cairo and Sharam el-Sheikh and
              will provide a forum for interaction between US scientists and potential
              collaborators from countries surrounding the focus study area.  The workshop
              includes a 2-day field trip along the Suez rift followed by a 3-day seminar in
              Sharam el-Shiekh that will summarize the state of the knowledge about the area
              and discuss further research need.
