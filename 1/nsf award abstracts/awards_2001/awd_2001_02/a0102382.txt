Abstract    :
              Arkady Berenstein  investigates the area lying at the
crossroads of the
              Representation Theory of Lie Groups, Quantum Groups
and Piecewise-Linear
              Combinatorics.  He studies  canonical bases and
crystal bases, the
              multiplicities for the representations of reductive groups,
and the totally
              positive varieties.  The main tools he uses for this study are
the valuations
              of the corresponding (quantum) algebras, the method of
involutions, convex
              polyhedra, rational maps and geometric crystals.

The subjects of Arkady
              Berenstein's research are combinatorial
structures in the area of Mathematics
              known as
Representation Theory of Lie algebras. These structures
naturally
              emerge in classical enumeration problems that arise
from physics, chemistry
              and other basic sciences in addition
to mathematics. Quite surprisingly, these
              purely
discrete structures have continuous counterparts. 
Understanding the
              relationship between these enumerative
combinatorial structures and the
              geometric structure of their
continuous counterparts is a question of the
              greatest
importance. This relationship proved to be a useful tool in
              the
study of Langlands Correspondence -- the most mysterious
and inspiring
              correspondence between Algebra and
Geometry of the 20th century Mathematics.
