This award provides partial support
              for active research mathematicians 
with limited means of support to attend
              and participate in the
Conference on geometry in dimension 3 and 4
to be held
              at the Columbus campus of the Ohio State Univeristy during
Spring 2002.

The
              list of main speakers includes Gregory Margulis (Yale), John Morgan
              
(Columbia), Rick Schoen (Stanford), Cliff Taubes (Harvard) and  S-T. Yau
              
(Harvard). The conference will be scheduled for a 3 day weekend, most likely
              
in late March of 2002. The schedule will be arranged so that 
there will be
              plenty of time for discussions between all the participants.
The full program 
              will appear soon in posters as well as in the web page:
