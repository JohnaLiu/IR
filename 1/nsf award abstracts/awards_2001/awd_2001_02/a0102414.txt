              will be provided for contributors at the European Science Foundation (ESF)-NSF
              Symposium on "Nanoparticles: Applications in Materials Science and
              Environmental Science and Engineering", to be held in Dublin, Ireland on
              September 6, 2000.  The meeting will bring together U.S and European scientists
              in the fields of aerosols, materials, environment and health.  The objectives
              are the presentation of the most recent findings in nanoparticle and related
              nanotechnology, evaluation of the research trends and opportunities, and
              enhancement of the long-term U.S.-European collaboration especially among young
              scientists and engineers in both regions.  The ESF sponsored network on
              nanoparticle research will be the co-organizer.   The symposium will consists
              of plenary review lectures given by senior researchers and poster sessions by
              young researchers.  Twelve young researchers will be selected from the U.S.
              nanoparticle community for invited poster presentations, and they will receive
              partial travel support.  A publication with the extended abstract proceedings
              will be prepared after the
