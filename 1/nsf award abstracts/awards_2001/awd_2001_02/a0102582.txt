Abstract    :
              The project describes proposed work of the newly reconfigured Center for
              Educaton of the National Research Council.  In September, 2000, the Center was
              expanded to include the Board on Testing and Assessment (BOTA), the Committee
              on Educatonal Excellence and Testing Equity (CEETE), and the Board on
              International Comparative Studies in Education (BISE).  Other boards, e.g., the
              Mathematical Sciences Education Board (MSEB), the Committee on Science
              Education K-12 (COSE K-12), and the Committee on Undergarduate Science
              Education (CUSE) will continue.  The Center will expand its work at the nexus
              of education policy, practice and research and will enable synergy among the
              various boards and committees around key issues.  Among the issues identified
              for study in the first two years of this grant are:

o  Relationships of
              classroom assessments and high stakes tests;
o  Effects of NSF-supported
              mathematics curricula;
o  Next steps in mathematics teacher development;
o 
              Taking stock of the National Science Education Standards;
o  Framing science
              teacher education as a continuum;
o  Criteria and Benchmarks for evaluating
              undergraduate SMETE program effectiveness;
o  Transitions from graduate
              learning to undergraduate teaching in SMETE;
o  Promoting inquiry-based
              science education for undergraduates;
o  Technical skills for work.

Work
              over the subsequent three years will be developed to take advantage of the most
              promising work of years  one and two, and to address current strategic issues
              in mathematics and science education strategically.
