              Abstract


        Carbons with sp2 and sp3 bonding exhibit entirely
              different envelope of properties. Here, we propose to fabricate and test (for
              mechanical properties) carbon nanocomposites by combining the two bonding.
              Recent advances in chemical vapor deposition of nanotubes and nanocrystalline
              diamond present a possible synergistic approach to synthesizing dense
              nanocomposite material with aligned and uniformly spaced nanotubes. CVD will be
              used to synthesize nanotubes oriented vertically to patterned substrates and by
              controlling the chemistry of plasma nanocrystalline diamond will be deposited
              on these. In addition, modeling of carbon nanotube-diamond hybrid
              microstructures will be done to understand mechanical properties and
              interfacial behavior.
