Abstract    :
              This 5-year Retention and Renewal proposal, targeting Boston Public Schools,
              builds on the extensive professional development work of EDC and TERC. 
              The"Cultivating Leadership to Support Elementary Mathematics Education Reform
              in Boston" project, targets approximately 400 teacher leaders who participate
              in over 200 hours of professional development.  Administrator leaders
              participate in over 45 hours of professional development, and an additional 600
              teachers participate in at least 130 hours of professional development through
              the leadership work in each school.  The professional development designed to
              strengthen participants' mathematics teaching practice will support schools in
              the implementation of the Investigations in Number, Data and Space.  All 87
              elementary schools in Boston will be supported by this project. 

In addition
              the project targets seven carefully selected schools where teacher and
              administrator leadership is firmly in place and there is a school-wide focus on
              mathematics teaching and learning.  These "Learning Site Schools" will serve as
              resources to other schools in the district, providing opportunities to learn
              about how teacher and administrator leadership is developed, how leadership is
              leveraged within a school, and how a school-wide focus on mathematics teaching
              and learning is created and sustained.  Two additional schools, one without the
              infrastructure to support reform and one with minimal infrastructure to support
              these efforts, will receive extensive support.  Research documenting the change
              process for schools at different stages of reform will be conducted.
