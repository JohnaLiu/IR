Abstract    :
              Divisions of Chemistry, and Bioengineering and Environmental Systems support
              this multidivisional award to University of California Los Angeles, and this
              award is part of the Nanoscale Exploratory Research in the Nanoscale Science
              and Engineering program.  Under this project, Jeffrey Zink will synthesize
              nano-engineered photo-electrochemical cells by self assembly process using
              solution-based sol-gel process, which will replace time consuming step-by-step
              serial assembly process. This materials synthesis method will provide
              flexibility in the spatial configuration and the chemical environment of the
              photoelectron donors and acceptors.  Theoretical studies will be performed to
              determine the charge separation and electron transport in the nanostructured
              materials.  The research program will provide education and training
              opportunities in material chemistry to underrepresented groups in undergraduate
              education through the Student Research Participation and Center for Academic
              Excellence programs at University of California at Los Angeles.

Under the
              award, nano-engineered photo-electrochemical cells will be fabricated using a
              solution-based sol-gel self-assembly process.  The process will yield ordered
              and oriented nanostructures of relatively large sizes for the development of
              photoelectrochemical devices. In addition, the research program will provide
              multidisciplinary education and training opportunities in materials chemistry
              to underrepresented groups in undergraduate education.
