Abstract    :
              The investigator will study questions in the deformation
theory of global
              Galois representations. Let a two
dimensional mod p Galois representation be
              given.
Serre has conjectured this representation "comes from"
a modular form.
              His conjecture necessarily implies the mod p 
Galois representation is the mod
              p reduction of some p-adic
Galois representation. The author plans to continue
              his
study of whether such deformations exist independently of
Serre's
              Conjecture, and if they can 
be arranged to be potentially semistable in the
              sense of Fontaine. 
Such constructions, especially combined with recent work
              of Taylor,
could be regarded as providing evidence for Serre's
              Conjecture.
There are interesting cases that are still open, such as
              reducible
residual representations and representations of the absolute
Galois
              group of totally real fields.

The proposed research falls under the general
              area of Number Theory,
which has its roots in the study of whole numbers and
              their 
various properties. Natural questions that arise in this field, 
such
              as properties of prime numbers and how frequently they occur,
can have
              applications to coding theory and cryptography. The proposed
research is also
              related to Galois Theory, the study of symmetries
of solutions to equations.
              Studying these symmetries
can shed light on the understanding their solutions,
              a
basic mathematical question.
