Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
              FY2001.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
              protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
              not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
              opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
              microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
              established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
              research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
              fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
              research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
              of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
              locations. 

The research and training plan is entitled "Effects of energy,
              environmental variation, and dynamic constraints on the structure of
              experimental microbial food webs."  A lab-based microbial system, comprised of
              bacteria, autotrophic algae, heterotrophic protozoa, and rotifers, is being
              used to determine the effects of environmental variability and energy on the
              emergent structure of food webs.  Webs of varying complexity are experimentally
              perturbed and changes in web structure are compared to stability measures to
              assess how perturbations and stability-complexity interact to generate
              community organization.
