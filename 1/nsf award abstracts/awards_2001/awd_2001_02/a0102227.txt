Abstract    :
              The PI, collaborators and students develop statistical models and methods for
              problems involving latent structure in large and complex data sets.  Specific
              research topics include: new models for regression and prediction with latent
              variables; a range of developments involving latent structure in Bayesian
              regression models and associated algorithmic implementation using simulation
              methods; statistical aspects of machine learning algorithms for regression and
              classification; generalized linear and multivariate latent factor models;
              models with errors in predictor variables; empirical factor models. Research in
              these areas is partly motivated by applications in bioinformatics in the area
              of gene expression profiling, and related research and applications in time
              series in finance and communications signals processing.

This research is
              concerned with creating and implementing improved methods for the statistical
              analysis of large and complex data sets arising in fields such as functional
              genomics, finance and communications engineering.  The research goals include
              creating new mathematical models that can adequately represent the complex
              structure of increasingly large data sets, together with appropriate
              computational tools and algorithms for the analysis of such data using these
              models.  The need for substantial advances in this area of statistical research
              are highlighted by the analysis challenges posed by the increasingly large and
              complex gene expression data sets that are becoming standard in biomedical
              research due to rapid advances in genome technology, and major aspects of this
              research involve applications in functional genomics.  Additional applications
              of models arising from this research lie in analysis of time series data
              arising in areas including finance and communications.
