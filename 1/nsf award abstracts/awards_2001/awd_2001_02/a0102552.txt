The principal investigator studies complete 
              
aspherical spaces with particular emphasis on the  
rigidity of local
              splitting structures  
and the minimal volume problem. Dr. Cao  
intends to
              continue his work on Gromov's  
minimal volume gap conjecture jointly with 
              
his coauthors. Using the F-structure theory developed  
by Cheeger and
              Gromov and the heat flow, he  
would like to study the  minimal volume gap 
              
conjecture for complete aspherical  
manifolds. The investigator hopes to 
              
show that if a compact nonpositively curved  
manifold $M$ is homotopy
              equivalent to a generalized  
graph-manifold, then $M$ must be a generalized 
              
graph-manifold with vanishing minimal volume as well.   
In addition, Cao
              plans to continue  
his study of the sign of the Euler number of  
compact
              aspherical manifolds. 


This project focuses on the study of global 
              
geometric shape of aspherical spaces. The examples  
of aspherical spaces
              include flat tires and surfaces  
with more than two holes, such as pretzels.
              There are  
also examples of higher dimensional aspherical  
spaces. Our
              universe can be viewed a 3-dimensional  
aspherical space. Dr. Cao is trying
              to investigate  
diameter, volume, spectrum and other geometric data  
of
              those spaces. Cao has also been interested in the  
study of the shortest
              closed curves on non-positively  
curved spaces. He has already shown that two
              such surfaces  
with possible cusps are isometric if and  
only if the data
              of lengths of all shortest closed curves on  
the two surfaces are identical.
              The data of lengths  
of all shortest closed curves on a closed  
surface M
              is called the marked length spectrum  
of the space M. The study of marked
              length spectrum on  
spaces with boundaries has a number of applications  
in
              modern industry and geological sciences.
