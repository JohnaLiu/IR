Abstract    :
              Jose Cortes-Figueroa, Chemistry Department, University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez,
              is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry
              Program. The focus of the work is the synthesis and characterization of
              transition metal fullerene complexes. Novel fullerene-transition metal carbonyl
              complexes will be synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic and
              electrochemical techniques. Reaction rates and activation parameters of the
              fullerene substitution processes will also be studied. Overall, this project
              should provide information on the thermodynamics of the fullerene-transition
              metal interaction.

Transition metal fullerenes show unique chemistry and
              electrochemistry. These properties may be exploited in the optics, materials
              science, and electronics areas. This award is under the Research in
              Undergraduate Institutions Program (RUI) and involves several undergraduates at
              the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez. These students will learn important
              laboratory skills while conducting cutting-edge research.
