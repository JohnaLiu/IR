Two institutions in Miami, Florida International
              University (FIU) and Fairchild Tropical Garden (FTG), plan a multidisciplinary,
              two-year program to mentor 27 upper-level students in tropical environmental
              biology. The program involves 13 FIU faculty and an education specialist from
              FTG. The immediate objective of the program is for students to develop careers
              in biological sciences relating to the environment. To achieve this objective
              the PIs will direct a mentoring program on the natural history, marine and
              terrestrial environments, and conservation biology of the Caribbean region. To
              attract high-quality students, the program will provide: stipends, three new
              upper-level courses, field courses (in the Bahamas and Panama), Florida field
              trips, laboratory rotations, research supplies, travel to a professional
              meeting, and career orientation activities. Mentors will offer academic,
              research and career advice. Each student will produce and present a research
              project. The program will have internal and external evaluations by a steering
              committee, two outside evaluators and an advisory committee.

FIU is one of
              the leading U.S. research universities in recruiting students from groups that
              are under-represented in science (71% are African American or Hispanic). In the
              long term, this program will produce well trained environmental biologists who
              will have a positive impact on the conservation of fragile environments of the
              Caribbean - South Florida region.
