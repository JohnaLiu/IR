Complex electronic oxides that show remarkable properties,
              such as the colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) manganites and the high-temperature
              superconductive cuprates, have atomic and nano-scale local structures that are
              distinct from the average crystal structure, and these local structures more
              directly influence their electronic properties than the average structure does.
               The goal of this project is to determine the local structure of complex
              electronic oxides using pulsed neutron scattering, synchrotron x-ray scattering
              and modeling.  We directly determine the distances between atoms using the
              method of the atomic pair-density function (PDF) analysis of the total
              scattering data including diffuse scattering.

The knowledge obtained by
              this project would form a scientific basis for the rapidly developing
              technology of highly sensitive oxides, and would suggest ways of improving
              their performance.  This project is also related to the effort to upgrade a
              pulsed neutron powder diffraction beamline, NPD, at the Los Alamos Neutron
              Science Center, supported by the NSF and DOE.
