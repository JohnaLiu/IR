Abstract    :
              The investigators will examine processes structuring microplankton communities
              and linking them with populations of Neocalanus spp., the dominant
              particle-grazing copepods in the coastal Gulf of Alaska.  Collectively, three
              species of Neocalanus contribute substantially to total spring and summer
              mesozooplankton biomass in the coastal Gulf of Alaksa.  Neocalanus are capable
              of consuming both phytoplankton and microzooplankton, though factors dictating
              this diet partitioning are not well understood.  Further, these copepods have
              been shown to alter individual body size, population biomass, and life cycle
              timing in response to variations in ocean conditions.  Finally, the size and
              abundance of Neocalanus make them an important potential prey for pink salmon
              fry and other coastal fish species.  Thus, the microplankton - Neocalanus food
              web is a potential locus for the translation of environmental variation into
              higher trophic level responses.  Specific measurements to be made include:
              microplankton abundance and composition, rates of microzooplankton herbivory,
              and rates of Neocalanus spp. grazing on microzooplankton and phytoplankton.
