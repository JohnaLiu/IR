This
              project is focused on the interplay between 
principles of geometry and the
              principles of the 
mathematical theory of shock waves.  There are three main
              
areas of research.  The first is analysis of regularity 
and shock formation
              in initial value problems for weak 
solutions of the Einstein equations.  The
              second area is 
development of shock-matching methods with application to
              
blast waves in general relativity.  The third area is 
investigation of
              oscillations in systems of conservation 
laws, with particular emphasis on
              analyzing oscillations 
that are generated in transonic flow.  As part of the
              
project, we combine Glimm's theory of wave interactions 
with the theory of
              general relativity to analyze shock 
wave interactions for Einstein's
              equations.  Since the 
Einstein equations contain the compressible Euler
              
equations as a subsystem, results on shock wave 
propagation in general
              relativity are expected to have 
new implications for analysis of shock waves
              in classical 
fluids.

We are developing a theory of shock wave propagation
              in 
Einstein's theory of general relativity. A shock wave is 
best known as
              the blast wave that marks the leading edge 
of an explosion.  In that case,
              the shock wave is the 
surface between the rapidly expanding material and the
              
ambient, undisturbed air into which the shock front 
propagates. In general
              relativity, shock waves are waves 
in the curvature of spacetime itself. There
              are thus new 
and interesting fundamental issues involved in extending
              
Einstein's equations to a setting that admits shock wave 
propagation.  As
              part of the project, we are constructing 
new exact solutions of Einstein's
              equations that 
incorporate a blast wave into the Big Bang -- the 
explosion
              that first set the universe into expansion.  
The mathematical results will
              also have application to 
shock waves in ordinary fluids.
