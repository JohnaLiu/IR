Abstract    :
              Support is provided for the 45th, 46th and 47th  annual meetings of the Wind
              River Conference on Prokaryotic Biology,  held at the Aspen Lodge, Estes Park,
              Colorado. The meetings are held annually each summer. This conference is
              primarily concerned with the biology of prokaryotes, and is the major annually
              occurring meeting devoted to this subject area. One significant feature of
              these meetings is their accessibility to graduate students and post-doctoral
              students, whose travel funds frequently are limited. Specifically to address
              this problem,  funds are provided for travel and support scholarships to
              facilitate the attendance of graduate students and post-doctoral students
              working in various areas that comprise prokaryotic biology.
