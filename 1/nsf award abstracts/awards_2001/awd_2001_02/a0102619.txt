Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for Research and Development on several
              experimental devices with the goal of measuring the branching ratio of the rare
              KoL decay into po n n-bar.  This decay occurs through a CP (charge conjugation
              x parity) violating interaction, and knowledge of its rate will complement the
              worldwide research effort to observe CP violation through decay of B mesons. 
              In particular, a difference between the CP violating parameters in B decay and
              those in K decay would indicate CP violation outside the Standard Model of
              particle physics.  Such a difference would be a natural consequence of many of
              the formulations that extend the clearly incomplete Standard Model and of the
              matter-antimatter asymmetry observed in our Universe.

The KOPIO experiment
              will be mounted at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, using the Alternate
              Gradient Synchrotron proton accelerator as a driver for a new, extremely
              intense neutral kaon beam. While neither the beamline components nor the
              particle detectors are beyond the state of the art in their respective
              technologies, significant development and detailed design work are required
              before construction.
