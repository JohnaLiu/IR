Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
              FY2001.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
              protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
              not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
              opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
              microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
              established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
              research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
              fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
              research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
              of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
              locations. 

The research and training plan is entitled "Evolutionary
              genetics of ecological diversification in cyanobacterial populations from hot
              spring habitats differing in nitrogen availability."  Understanding how
              ecological differences evolve in microbial populations is essential for
              explaining the magnitude and distribution of microbial diversity.  This
              research uses a combination of quantitative, population and developmental
              genetic approaches to: (1) test for ecological divergence between populations
              of the cyanobacterium Mastigocladus laminosus from
habitats differing in
              nitrogen availability; (2) evaluate the evolutionary processes shaping
              ecological structure in these populations; and (3) link molecular genetic
              variation to variation in the ability to assimilate different nitrogen
              sources.
