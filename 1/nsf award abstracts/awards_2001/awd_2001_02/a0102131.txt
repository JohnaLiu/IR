Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the behavior of ill-conditioned regressors with
              correlated response generalized estimating equations (GEE) framework.  This ill
              conditioning occurs when the Fisher's Information matrix is nearly singular, a
              situation that leads to traditional problems of 'multicollinearity'.  The
              resulting effect is poor prediction, large variability in the population
              parameters that are being estimated and poor testing.  The Principal
              Investigator will subdivide the alternative estimators and will then propose
              well-defined estimations techniques for the subclasses.

The estimators are
              used to understand regression under ill-posed conditions.  The procedures to be
              developed under this grant are primarily for the purpose of understanding the
              fundamental aspects, but also will have application to large longitudinal data
              sets and provide a unifying framework for generalized models and the
              expectation/maximization algorithm, chemometrics and genomics. The Principal
              Investigator will enable many students from a large number of disciplines to
              participate in his education/research efforts.
