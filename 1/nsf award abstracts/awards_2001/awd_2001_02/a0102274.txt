Abstract    :
              The proposed research considers several problems in the higher-order asymptotic
              theory of likelihood-based inference. Many higher-order approximations apply
              only to the case in which the underlying data have a continuous distribution.
              The proposed research considers the extension of these results to the case in
              which the underlying data have a lattice distribution. A second aspect of the
              research is the development of methods for models with a hierarchical
              structure. Likelihood methods are generally derived under the assumption that
              the likelihood function is correctly specified. Of course, in practice, the
              probability models used are often only an approximation to the true, but
              unknown, models. Hence, the proposed research considers the development of
              methods that are based on more limited assumptions, such as moment conditions. 
              

Statistical methods based on the likelihood function play a central role in
              statistical theory and methodology. Many of these methods are based on
              approximations which may have questionable accuracy in certain cases. The
              proposed research develops methods of approximation with generally higher
              accuracy.  The result is statistical methods that offer an improvement over
              those currently available.
