Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to investigate the generation and magnetic trapping
              of ultracold molecules in laser-cooled gases and in Bose-Einstein condensates,
              the interactions between ultracold atoms and molecules, and the possible
              formation of a molecular condensate. This will be accomplished with single
              color or Raman photoassociation of atoms in a laser-cooled or Bose-condensed
              Rb-87 gas, and with a Feshbach resonance in Rb-87.  Molecules will be detected
              with resonant multi-photon ionization, which can be both sensitive and
              state-selective. In addition, nonlinear atom-optical methods could be used to
              probe the molecular state.  Atom-molecule collision rate
measurements will be
              carried out, and these may yield evidence of new kinds of ultracold collision
              resonance phenomena. Precise measurements of the stimulated Raman free-bound
              lineshapes will provide further information. The limitations to coherent
              atom-molecule interconversion will be investigated. Bose condensation and
              molecule formation in a tightly confining optical trap in which excitations are
              suppressed will be investigated. An optical trap will also be used for the
              Feshbach resonance studies and to study a Rb-87 spinor condensate. Finally, an
              effort will be made to generate a molecular condensate with free-bound
              transitions from an atomic condensate, and to investigate its properties and
              its interactions with the atomic condensate.
