Abstract    :
              This action provides support for U.S. participation in the tsunami symposium to
              be held in Nice, France, March 2001.  This symposium is a part of the Natural
              Hazards program within the 26th General Assembly of the European Geophysical
              Society.  It will present the state-of-the-art as regards tsunami generation,
              propagation and impact along coastlines, as well as discuss the tools needed to
              assess and mitigate the tsunami hazard.  The participants supported by this
              grant include key researchers and junior members of the U.S. tsunami community;
              their presence at this meeting is critical for future cooperative research
              efforts.  The symposium topics include contributions from geophysics, geology,
              numerical modeling, social and economical sciences, urban planning, and warning
              systems.

Tsunami research has become increasingly important and
              international in its focus.  Strong international cooperation is necessary
              since tsunamis can affect not only the region near the source but also distant
              regions through propagation across oceans.  There were eleven major tsunami
              disasters around the world during the last decade, starting with the 1992
              Nicaragua tsunami.  A spectrum of challenging tsunami-related research will be
              presented and discussed at this symposium; it is expected that collaborative
              projects in many of these topics will be initiated by the participants.
