Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
              FY2001.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
              protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
              not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
              opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
              microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
              established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
              research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
              fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
              research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
              of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
              locations. 

The research and training plan is entitled "Genetic Diversity in
              Benzoate Degrading Denitrifying Bacteria and Environmental Samples."  Genetic
              diversity of 16S rRNA, nitrite reductase, and benzoyl-CoA reductase in bacteria
              capable of degrading benzoate under denitrifying conditions are being
              investigated with bacterial pure cultures isolated from estuarine sediments of
              a contaminated landfill site. In addition, DNAs will be extracted directly from
              the same sediment and environmental DNA clonal libraries (metagenome library)
              will be constructed to link the different kind of genetic information obtained
              from 16S rRNA genes and functional genes involved in benzoate degradation and
              denitrification in the environment.
