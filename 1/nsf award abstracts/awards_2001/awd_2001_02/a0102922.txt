This project focuses on constructing symplectic, contact
              and
4-dimensional manifolds.  The Principal Investigator has defined
a
              topological structure called a "hyperpencil" on an
even-dimensional closed
              manifold, generalizing a linear system of
curves on a complex algebraic
              manifold.  He has shown that any
hyperpencil canonically determines a
              symplectic structure on the
manifold.  In dimensions less than 8, this
              correspondence maps
the set of hyperpencils onto a dense subset of all
              symplectic
forms on the manifold (up to isotopy and scale).  A
              similar
statement seems likely in higher dimensions, and would provide
              a
complete topological characterization of those manifolds
admitting
              symplectic structures.  If the fibers of this
correspondence can be
              topologically specified, the result will be
a purely topological description
              of a dense subset of all
symplectic structures on all closed manifolds.  In
              addition to
this investigation, Stein surfaces and their contact
              3-manifold
boundaries will be studied by methods such as Legendrian
              Kirby
calculus.  The topology of exotic R^4's and other smooth
4-manifolds
              will also be investigated.

An n-manifold is a space that in small regions
              looks just like
n-dimensional Euclidean space.  Points, curves and surfaces
              are
manifolds of dimensions 0,1 and 2, respectively.  The space in
which we
              live is a 3-manifold, and the universe (space-time) is a
4-manifold. 
              Surprisingly, 3- and 4-manifolds are much less well
understood than their
              higher-dimensional counterparts, although
major progress has been made in
              recent years.  Symplectic and
contact structures on manifolds were discovered
              through classical
physics (Hamiltonian mechanics and optics, respectively),
              but
they are now seen to be important in such diverse areas as
quantum
              physics, complex analysis, differential geometry and
topology.  For example, a
              rigid pendulum swinging in
3-dimensional space determines a symplectic
              manifold.  The bob
moves on a spherical surface, so its position is specified
              by 2
variables (latitude and longitude on this sphere).  To
              completely
specify the state of the system, one must also include
              the
momentum of the bob.  At any position, its momentum is tangent to
the
              sphere and thus specified by two more variables.  Hence, the
set of states of
              the system is a 4-manifold (locally specified by
4 variables).  This
              4-manifold has a special symplectic structure
whose role is to link each
              position variable to the corresponding
momentum variable.  This linkage
              ultimately results in Hamilton's
equations describing the motion of the
              pendulum under the
influence of a specified force field.  There are many
              other
situations in which manifolds and their symplectic and
              contact
structures arise.  While our understanding of such structures
              has
advanced enormously in recent years, some of the most basic
questions
              remain to be answered.  Which manifolds have symplectic
or contact structures,
              and how many such structures are there on
a given manifold?  How many
              4-manifolds (if any) are there
satisfying a given description?  Questions such
              as these form the
basis of this project.
