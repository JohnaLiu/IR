This U.S.-Mexico award will support joint collaborative work
              between Prof. Richard Reidy of the University of North Texas and Prof. Oscar
              Mendoza Gonzalez of the Instituto Tecnologico de Saltillo together with
              colleagues at CINVESTAV-Queretaro, in the field of biomaterials.  More
              specifically, the researchers will focus on the relationship between the
              structure and surface functionalities of silica xerogels and aerogels and the
              consequent growth mechanisms, compositions, and morphologies of hydroxyapatites
              grown on these substrates from simulated body fluids. 

Using small-angle
              neutron scattering, gas adsorption, electron microscopy, and a range of
              instrumentation and expertise available at the collaborating institutions, the
              results of this research collaboration should prove useful in the development
              of inexpensive bioactive or resorbable bioceramic materials with many potential
              bioengineering applications.
