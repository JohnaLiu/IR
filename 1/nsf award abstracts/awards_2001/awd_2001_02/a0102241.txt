Abstract    :
              The project proposes to convene publishers, curriculum developers and state and
              district science education leaders for two separate but related conferences. 
              The first targets curriculum developers.  The second will include developers,
              and adds individuals responsible for curriculum development in states and
              districts.  The goals of the conferences are for participants to gain a more
              complete understanding of the Project 2061 curriculum evaluation instrument,
              and to analyze and critique it.  In addition, the conference proceedings
              (including commissioned papers) will be published on-line and information about
              the proceedings will be distributed through the project's newsletter
              (circulation 50,000).
