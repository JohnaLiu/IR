Abstract    :
              The three-year project will develop a coordinated set of six courses designed
              specially to prepare teachers to teach mathematics in the middle grades, level
              5-8.  The courses will form the core of a Master's Degree program or can be
              taken separately for certification.  Two existing courses will be modified. 
              The project is a collaborative effort involving university mathematicians,
              statisticians, mathematics educators, Presidential Awardees for Excellence in
              Mathematics Teaching and other exemplary middle-level teachers.  The objectives
              include:  increase the conceptual content knowledge of middle-level teachers,
              provide exposure to exemplary materials and develop skills to use them, prepare
              teachers to act as mentors, work with the state on certification, strengthen
              infrastructure that supports preparation and professional development, enhance
              teaching practices of middle-level teachers and college faculty, produce
              knowledge about collaborative course and program development, produce research
              results on developing and implementing a research-based and standards-based
              program for in-service teachers, and contribute to the understanding of adult
              education teaching strategies and distance delivery systems that can be
              effective in under-served rural areas (due to very small schools and great
              distances between them).  This project addresses the fact that sixty-four
              percent of the teachers teaching mathematics do not have a state credential in
              mathematics.
