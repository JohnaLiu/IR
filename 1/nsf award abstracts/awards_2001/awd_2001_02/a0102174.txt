Abstract    :
              In this proposal funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Arthur Suits of the State University of New York at Stony
              Brook will pursue a program of research on ion pair imaging spectroscopy. 
              Vacuum ultraviolet radiation will be used to drive dissociation of various
              molecules to produce ion pairs.  The kinetic energy released, when one of the
              ions in the pair is structureless (e.g., chloride ion) maps the energy levels
              of the co-fragment in a manner analogous to photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). 
              This approach permits study of species for which no stable precursors re
              available, and will readily allow for probing levels that are optically
              inaccessible.  The overarching goal of this project is to obtain vibrational
              frequencies and thermochemical data for elusive ionic species not accessible to
              conventional techniques.  Preliminary studies of the methyl cation will be
              extended to include related C2 and C3 species, as well as the methylene
              cation.

The results of these studies will be used as benchmarks for
              comparison to theoretical calculations, for their intrinsic value in
              determining the thermochemical scales on which all of chemistry relies, and for
              developing the fundamental understanding of transient species of importance in
              combustion, atmospheric and interstellar chemistry.
