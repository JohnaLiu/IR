This U.S.- Brazil Program award provides support for
              cooperative research between Dr. Ronald E. Olson, University of Missouri-Rolla
              and Drs. Geraldo M. Sigaud and Eduardo C. Montenegro of Pontificia University
              of Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in an international study on the
              dynamics of ionizing collisions.
This collaborative research project combines
              the theoretical expertise of Dr. Olson and the experimental expertise and
              resources of Drs. Sigaud and Montenegro to develop a better understanding of
              the fundamental subtleties of electron-electron and electron-ion interactions
              in fast heavy particle collisions. They will develop momentum spectroscopy
              techniques that are needed to understand the relative importance of
              interactions in atomic collision studies.  The results of this research will
              allow the interpretation of very difficult charge exchange measurements and
              increase our understanding of many collision processes in nature, such as
              energy deposition processes in biological tissue, in health-related
              applications, in fusion energy development and in material science
              applications.
