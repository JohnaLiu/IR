Title: Mathematical Models of Materials with
              Multi-Stability at the Micro-Level

We propose to study rate sensitivity of
              the prototypical discrete analogs of active materials. At the micro-level,
              active materials can be viewed as complex assemblages of multi-stable,
              molecular size devices; large deformations are then due to the switching
              between different locally stable configurations. At the macro-level the
              switching leads to the energy flux into smaller scales and 
associated
              dissipation. In this project we focus on optimization of energy transduction
              between the scales in multi-stable materials and specifically consider behavior
              of these systems in the situations where fluctuations are relevant and the size
              effect can not be neglected.

In this research project we study the dynamic
              behavior of active materials which include shape-memory, magnetostrictive and
              ferromagnetic alloys, transformation-toughened ceramics and materials,
              exhibiting controllable distributed micro-damage. Biological examples of active
              materials are provided by muscles and other distributed protein systems.  The
              goal of the project is to understand the mechanics of dissipation and active
              force generation in these materials which may open ways to an actual
              construction of the artificial molecular size motors. Specifically we 
are
              interested in developing prototypes for ultra-small objects, which can carry
              load and be self propelled.
