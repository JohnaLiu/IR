In the proposed research, formation of the theoretically
              predicted new dense phases in the B-C-N composition triangle will be
              systematically examined over a wide pressure and temperature range using laser
              heated diamond anvil cell (up to 1x 106 atm or 14.7 x 106 psi and 2500oC) as
              well as large-volume high P-T apparatus (up to 3x 105 atm or 44.1 x 105 psi and
              2000oC). The structures and properties of quenched samples will be analyzed by
              powder x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, hardness measurements, and
              optical and acoustical methods.  The overall scientific goals of the project
              are: (1) synthesis of novel superhard phases in the B-C-N system at high
              pressures and high temperatures by direct conversion of layered B-C-N phases,
              (2) investigation of physico-chemical and structural properties of the
              end-products at ambient conditions, and (3) characterization of elastic and
              vibrational properties of novel phase(s) at high pressures up to 1x 106 atm
              (14.7 x 106 psi) and at room temperature.

The proposed research will
              provide valuable data that will be used to identify main features of the phase
              transformations observed in the B-C-N system at high pressures and
              temperatures, and the factors responsible for formation of superhard B-C-N
              phases. These results will enhance our understanding of the fundamental problem
              in development of new superhard materials and will provide a sound basis of
              developing and producing new super-abrasives that are thermally and chemically
              more stable than diamond, and harder than cubic BN, enabling major advances in
              the cutting and polishing industries.
