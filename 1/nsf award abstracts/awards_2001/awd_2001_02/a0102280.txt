              Modeling

Many application domains ranging from engineering to medicine
              require the computer modeling of physical objects. Laser range scanners and
              other modern scanning devices are capable of sampling large numbers of points
              on the surface of a physical object. Computing a model of an object, often
              referred to as surface reconstruction, has received wide attention in recent
              years. In the proposed postdoctoral training and research project, the problem
              of how to perform surface reconstruction of a physical object from a set of
              sampled points will be further studied. Specifically, a postdoctoral associate
              will focus on extending the cocone algorithm to handle large, noisy, and
              undersampled sets of data points.  The associate's research will contribute to
              building a software library that provides the reconstruction functionality
              needed to meet the widespread demands of a range of users across disciplines.
