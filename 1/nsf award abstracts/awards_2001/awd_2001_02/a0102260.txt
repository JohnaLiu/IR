This award will supply shipboard
              scientific support equipment for the research vessels Thompson and Barnes
              operated by the University of Washington and dedicated to use in support of
              marine research.  The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides
              funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of
              ocean science research. The Program provides support for such items as deck
              equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of
              scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and
              earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites,
              communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers
              for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as
              motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval
              sites.  The Project Director, Russell McDuff is fully qualified to direct this
              project having had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and
              installation of shipboard equipment.  This project will allow the institution
              to acquire tension meter system, Inmarsat B, Oil Spill Boom, and a precision
              Autopilot System.  ***
