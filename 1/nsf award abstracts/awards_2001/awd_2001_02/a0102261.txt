This project investigates several nonlinear problems
              arising from the theory of electromagnetic fields and heat conduction.  The
              first problem area concerns investigation of induction heating processes.  The
              mathematical model consists of nonlinear Maxwell's equations coupled with a
              nonlinear heat equation.  The objective is to analyze whether or not thermal
              runaway (blowup) happens and how to prevent it if it does occur during a
              heating process.  More complicated free boundary problems, modeling phase
              change during the heating process, are also under study.  The second problem
              area concerns investigation of a p-Laplacian type of evolution system that
              models the classical Bean's critical-state model in the superconductivity
              theory.  The effort focuses on understanding how the phase change takes place
              between normal and superconducting states. 

This project investigates
              mathematical models of heat flow in situations that involve electromagnetic
              fields.  These models are important for many industrial applications.  The
              results of this work will lead to a better understanding the complicated
              dynamics of electromagnetic fields and will provide explanations for certain
              experimental phenomena.  In addition, this investigation will produce
              mathematical results of general interest for the study of Maxwell's equations
              and nonlinear heat conduction.
