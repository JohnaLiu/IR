This Nanoscale Exploratory Research award, which results
              from the Nanoscale Science and Engineering solicitation (NSF 00-119), supports
              theoretical research on shot noise in nanoscale conductors. The PI will develop
              theoretical and computational tools that use the wavefunctions of density
              functional theory-based calculations for molecular devices in an external bias
              to calculate current flow and current fluctuations. These tools would be
              applied to study shot noise in nanoscale conductors composed of atomic and
              molecular chains with the further aim to innovate new designs for reduced noise
              electronic devices with dimensions on the nanoscale. The proposal has an
              additional educational component that aims to incorporate the research approach
              into the graduate Computational Physics course.

This Nanoscale
              Exploratory Research award, which results from the Nanoscale Science and
              Engineering solicitation, supports theoretical research on shot noise in
              nanoscale conductors. The PI will develop theoretical tools based on modern
              electronic structure methods to describe the flow of electric current in
              molecular devices.  A particular focus of the research is to calculate self
              consistently electronic currents and current fluctuations in these nanoscale
              devices. The PI aims to use these tools to innovate new designs for reduced
              noise electronic devices with dimensions on the nanoscale. The proposal has an
