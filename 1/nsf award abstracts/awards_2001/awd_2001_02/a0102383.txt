Abstract    :
              The Amphibians and Reptiles and Their Parasites of Mexico-A Megadiverse
              Country
 
This project will inventory the diversity of amphibians and
              reptiles of Mexico, the country with the largest numbers of species of these
              two classes of vertebrates.  In addition to the large number of species, Mexico
              is of particular biogeographical interest because it includes the transition
              zone between the two great faunal regions of the Western Hemisphere, the
              Neartic and Neotropical.  An analysis of previous collecting localities
              revealed a large geographical collecting bias.  The rugged relief of Mexico has
              made access into many highland areas difficult, and this is reflected in the
              small number of collections made in mountainous regions above 1500 meters.
              

As specimens of amphibians and reptiles are collected, the parasites living
              on them also will be collected and preserved for taxonomic identification. 
              Based on previous information, it is anticipated that parasites from at least
              seven different invertebrate phyla will be collected and identified. The
              amphibians and reptiles and their parasites (protozoans and metazoans, internal
              and external) will be surveyed over a three-year period, emphasizing the most
              poorly known mountainous regions.  These regions have been selected because
              they are the most poorly known, and in several of them the forests are rapidly
              disappearing.

About 1100 described species of amphibians and reptiles are
              known from Mexico, and 62% of these species are known only from Mexico. 
              Approximately one hundred new species of amphibians and reptiles have been
              described from Mexico since 1980 even without an organized survey for the
              country.  It is anticipated that 200+ species of amphibians and reptiles, and a
              far larger number of parasites, remain to be discovered in Mexico.  In addition
              to describing new taxa, a web-accessible geo-referenced database for Mexican
              amphibians and reptiles will be developed, and checklists, distribution maps,
              and identification keys will be prepared.  The materials collected during this
              survey will be available to researchers in systematics, ecology, and
              conservation.  Graduate students from Mexico and the U.S., and Mexican
              scientists will participate in all aspects of the project.
