Abstract


This action funds an NSF
              Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for FY2001.  The fellowship
              supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal,
              fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered
              to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for a recent doctoral
              recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research
              experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden
              his/her scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the
              undergraduate and graduate training. These fellowships are further designed to
              assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional
              disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites,
              and facilities, including foreign locations. 

The research and training plan
              is entitled "Microbial Diversity and Hydrogen in the Yellowstone Ecosystem." 
              The goal of this work is to describe the microbial composition and metabolic
              underpinnings of the Yellowstone geothermal ecosystem, with the hypothesis that
              hydrogen is the primary biological energy source.  First, hydrogen
              concentration in waters are being measured.   Then, the associated biomass,
              consisting of hydrogen-metabolizing microorganisms, is being characterized
              using a molecular phylogenetic approach.
