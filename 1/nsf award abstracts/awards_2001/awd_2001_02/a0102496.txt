               PROJECT
              ABSTRACT

           

The main objectives  of this project are to develop
              nonsmooth 
analysis for semicontinuous functions and multivalued mappings 
on
              smooth manifolds and to apply these new analytical techniques 
to a variety of
              optimization and control problems.  Examples 
of nonsmooth (nondifferentiable)
              functions on manifolds are 
provided by the maximum eigenvalue of a symmetric
              matrix on the 
manifold of symmetric matrices, the Riemannian metric and
              
Riemannian distance functions on Riemannian manifold, control 
Lyapunov
              functions for stabilization of control systems on 
manifolds and optimal value
              functions for optimal control 
problems. The major directions  for research
              are the following: 
(i) subdifferential(infinitesimal) calculus for nonsmooth
              
functions on smooth manifolds;
(ii) applications of subdifferential calculus
              to optimization 
problems on smooth manifolds; 
(iii) applications of
              subdifferential calculus to the study 
of invariance of closed sets and
              monotonicity of semicontinuous 
functions with respect to  solutions of
              differential inclusions 
on manifolds;
(iv) applications of these results to
              the study of generalized 
solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi equations on manifolds;
              
(v) applications to the derivation of optimality conditions 
for general
              nonsmooth control problems on manifolds; 
(vi) applications of subdifferential
              calculus for constructing
discontinuous optimal and stabilizing feedback
              controls using 
nonsmooth optimal value  and control Lyapunov
              functions;
(vii) the study of interior point methods in semistable and
              
semidefinite programmings via discontinuous feedback techniques 
and the
              study of generalized gradient flows on manifolds.

Design of high-performance
              feedback controls for nonlinear systems 
whose mathematical models include
              manifolds is an active research 
area oriented to automotive, aerospace, and
              naval applications. 
It has been recognized that, in general, control tasks
              (such as 
stabilization or robust optimal control) for these systems cannot
              
be performed using traditional continuous feedback and  require 
              
discontinuous feedback.  Since existing mathematical tools 
(differential
              inclusion theory)  have proved inadequate for 
analysis of discontinuous
              feedback performance, this research 
project is aimed at developing  new
              analytical tools and techniques 
for such analysis. But feedback control is
              not the only one research 
field which will benefit from these new  analytical
              tools.  Other  
fields of application for  these research results include
              numerical 
and theoretical optimization, in particular, a development
              of
robust numerical methods  for new semistable and semidefinite
              
optimization problems, and  generalized solutions of partial 
differential
              equations on manifolds .
