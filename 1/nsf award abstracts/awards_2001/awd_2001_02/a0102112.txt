Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
              FY2001.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
              protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
              not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
              opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
              microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
              established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
              research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
              fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
              research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
              of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
              locations. 

The research and training plan is entitled "Molecular studies of
              microbial coevolution and endosymbiosis in a complex assemblage of hosts." 
              Chewing lice that infect birds harbor endosymbiotic bacteria (putatively
              Rickettsia) in specialized cells. Lice probably require these bacteria for
              digestion of the feathers on which they live. Selected nucleic acids are being
              sequenced to correctly place these bacteria in a phylogeny.  Rates of evolution
              are being compared and cophylogeny with their hosts is being tested.  Finally,
              the effect of endosymbiosis on nucleotide sequence evolution is being
              evaluated.
