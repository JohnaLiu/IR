This project seeks
              to synthesize and evaluate organic-inorganic hybrid membranes with a novel
              hierarchical nanostructure.  The basic frameworks are mesoporous inorganic
              membranes with average pore sizes ranging from 2 to 20 nanometers.  These
              membranes are chemically modified with dendrimers, either as ultra-thin
              supported films or as fillers that attach to the interior porous surfaces. 
              Dendrimers are highly branched, monodisperse polymers with dimensions ranging
              from one to a few dozen nanometers; their high surface-group density and
              tunable chemistry allows one to create membranes that are highly selective for
              various gas-phase species of interest.  Other design variables such as pore
              size, dendrimer size, and dendrimer surface coverage allow further control of
              membrane performance.  Thus, these unique nano-architectures afford a degree of
              simultaneous control over both the chemistry and free volume of the membrane
              that is difficult to achieve with purely polymeric or purely inorganic
              materials.

The goal of this project is to apply scientific and engineering
              concepts at the nanometer scale to create membranes of novel composition and
              structure.  Such membranes can perform environmentally important separations,
              such as the removal of volatile organic compounds from air, more efficiently
              than current techniques.  This will result in a cleaner environment at a lower
              cost.  Furthermore, the project provides an excellent opportunity for a
              collaboration that crosses the boundaries between Colleges (Engineering and
              Science) and disciplines (separations and synthetic organic chemistry).
