Abstract    :
              This award will support research on annually-laminated lake sediments (varves)
              to provide detailed records of past climate from the Great Lakes region of the
              United States over the past 12,000 years. Such varved sediment records can
              prove a treasure trove of information critical to addressing issues of drought
              frequency and abrupt climate change in the region.  

By constructing
              continuous oxygen isotope time series of Holocene climate variability for lead
              dated sediment records from individual lake sites, the investigators will
              evaluate climatic controls on oxygen isotope records with existing regional
              instrumental records of temperature, precipitation amount, and dominant
              atmospheric circulation patterns.  By focusing on high-resolution oxygen
              isotope analyses across discrete Holocene climatic events, the researchers will
              establish the characteristic and rate of past natural climate variability.
