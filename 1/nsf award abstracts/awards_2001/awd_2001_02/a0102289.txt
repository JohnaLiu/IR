Abstract    :
              Professor Theodore Cohen in the Department of Chemistry at the University of
              Pittsburgh is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for
              his research on lithium-ene cyclizations.  The project will investigate the
              scope and stereoselectivity of these ring-forming reactions; in addition,
              enolate-directed lithiations and the cyclopolymerization of dienes via
              titanium-ene intermediates will be studied.

With the support of the Organic
              and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Theodore Cohen is developing
              new, efficient methods for forming cyclic organic compounds.  These new methods
              for synthesizing cyclic compounds are most likely to find applications in the
              pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries.  New techniques for preparing
              polymers consisting of a series of rings in an ordered, controlled manner are
              also being investigated.  Variation of the polymerization procedures should
              result in new materials with novel physical properties.
