Abstract    :
              The funding is for the workshop "Pathways to the Future", to be held August
              10-11, 2002, in New York, NY. The workshop provides a venue for approximately
              20 young female researchers in probability and statistics to interact with each
              other and with approximately 5 invited established researchers. The young
              researchers must have received their Ph.D. within the five years prior to the
              workshop, and will give a short presentation of their research. All
              participants must also have the intention to attend the Joint Statistical
              Meetings that will be held August 11-15, 2002, in New York, NY.
