Abstract    :
              With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
              George A. Olah, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Southern
              California, is studying protolytically activated superelectrophiles and their
              chemistry. This includes the investigation of superacid catalyzed carbonylation
              of alkanes and cycloalkanes with protolytically activated formyl cation
              [HCO+...HA or, in the limiting case, HCOH(2+)] as the de facto formylating
              agent in both liquid and solid superacid systems. Superelectrophilic nitrations
              with activated nitronium ion reagents [NO2H(2+)], nitrosations with NOH(2+)
              equivalents, and acylations with protioacyl dications [RCOH(2+)] will be
              investigated. The chemistry of fluorine-substituted allyl cations and polyallyl
              cations, several elusive azo onium dications, including bisdiazonium dication
              [N4(2+)] and diazo acyl cation [N2CO(2+)], and a number of silylated onium
              ions, including silylated CO, CO2, COS, CS2, N2O, O2, and O3, will also be
              explored.

Numerous chemical transformations are effected by acids. Extremely
              potent acids have been discovered which can react with compounds which are only
              very weakly basic, and through such reactions of "superacids", extremely
              reactive species may be generated. Through the preparation and study of such
              species, one may gain insight into the mechanisms by which organic molecules
              react and develop the ability to effect chemical transformations of otherwise
              unreactive molecules, including petrochemical feedstocks. Professor George A.
              Olah, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Southern California,
              is carrying out fundamental studies of superacid-activated molecules and their
              reactions with the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program.
