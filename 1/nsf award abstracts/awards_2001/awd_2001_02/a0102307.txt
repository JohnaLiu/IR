The
              objective of this proposal is to convert carbohydrate-derived chemicals for the
              production of commodity chemicals.  Lactic acid produced from the fermentation
              of carbohydrates may be further processed for the production of commodity
              chemicals such as biodegradable polymers, 1,2-propanediol, ethyl lactate,
              acrylic acid, and acrylates.  The combination of fermentation processes and
              selective catalytic processes provides a clean route for the production of
              these commodity chemicals from renewable carbohydrate feedstocks instead of
              from non-renewable petroleum sources.  In previous work copper-based catalyst
              systems exhibited 100% conversion of lactic acid with high selectivity to the
              desired 1,2 propanediol.  Fundamental studies of the interactions of oxygenated
              hydrocarbons (hydroxy acids, organic acids, alcohols, and aldehydes) over
              copper-based materials and over transition-metal-based materials will be
              conducted.  The plan is to combine microcalorimetric measurements, reaction
              kinetics studies, spectroscopic investigations, and density functional theory
              calculations to elucidate pathways for reactions of light oxygenated compounds
              over supported metal catalysts. Overall, this work has the potential to enhance
              the commercialization of chemicals produced from renewable biological
              sources.
