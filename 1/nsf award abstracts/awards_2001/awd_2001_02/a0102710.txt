              Experimental Computer Science: Physical Geometric Algorithms and Systems for
              High-Throughput NMR

While automation is revolutionizing many aspects of
              biology, the determination of three-dimensional protein structure remains an
              expensive task.  Traditional automated and semiautomated approaches to protein
              structure determination through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
              require dozens of experiments and months of spectrometer time, making them
              unsuitable for high-throughput automation.  The research proposed is to develop
              algorithms and systems for determining protein structure from only a few key
              NMR spectra.  The system will use algorithms similar to and adapted from
              physical geometric algorithms, pattern recognition and machine vision, signal
              processing, and robotics, in order to analyze spectra, assign spectral peaks to
              atom interactions, compute secondary structure, and estimate the global fold. 
              Previously developed software, JIGSAW, represents NMR data with graphs encoding
              potential interactions between amino acid residues.  JIGSAW applies graph
              algorithms to find subgraphs encoding the secondary protein structure.  The
              postdoctoral research associate will build on the insights of JIGSAW by
              assisting to 1) integrate automated analysis of geometry and correlations in
              three-dimensional input spectra, 2) prove correctness, completeness, and
              complexity results within a random graph formalism, 3) extend JIGSAW to larger
              proteins, and 4) utilize long-range  interactions in order to estimate
              three-dimensional protein structure.
