The PI requests NSF funding of the first Wireless Grants
              Review Workshop to be held on February 20-21, 2001 at the National Academy of
              Sciences in Washington, DC.

The main objective of this workshop is to help
              establish closer ties among the wireless communications researchers at NSF and
              to facilitate a forum for exchanging ideas, discussing progress, minimizing
              duplication, and ultimately helping build and maintain a stronger research
              program in this area at NSF.  The workshop is also expected to help NSF learn
              of outcomes from ongoing research projects, highlight and display significant
              progress to communities at large, and also identify and focus future funding on
              promising technologies in this fast-growing area of research.
