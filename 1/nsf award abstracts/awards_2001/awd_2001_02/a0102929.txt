Abstract    :
              Dr. Carlyle Storm of the Gordon Research Conferences is sponsoring the 2001
              Electrochemistry Gordon Conference in Ventura CA, January 14-19, 2001.  The
              chair is Debra Rolison of the Naval Research Laboratory and the vice-chair is
              Henry White of University of Utah.  The theme of this meeting is "if charge
              moves, it's electrochemistry," and the topics include fields at surfaces,
              materials, electrochemical power sources, and nanochemistry.  This broader
              scope of the meeting represents a change from past meetings in the series.  The
              meeting has excellent participation of underrepresented groups.  The meeting is
              partially funded by this grant from the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary
              Activities and the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program.
