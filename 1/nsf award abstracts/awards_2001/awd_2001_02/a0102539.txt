Adaptive Performance and
              Power Management for Real-Time Systems

This research will enable real-time
              computer systems to monitor and automatically adapt their power usage to
              specified fault-tolerance and performance requirements, prevailing workload,
              and current and projected energy/power constraints.

Many systems, which are
              power-constrained, do not always have a strict limit on their power
              consumption.  Instead, they have periods of time during which energy supply is
              very limited, and should be used sparingly, while at other times, the power
              available is adequate and the system is allowed to exploit all its resources to
              deliver maximum performability.  While there has been a great deal of research
              in developing circuits and design techniques to build low-power devices, there
              is very little reported on techniques to adjust power consumption on-the-fly to
              adapt to changing levels of workload and energy/power availability.  There is
              the need for an integrated approach, ranging from the hardware operation (using
              voltage-clock scaling or a sleep mode) to the application level.  Our
              preliminary investigations have shown that such an integrated approach,
              exploiting the synergy between these various layers, is far more effective than
              single-layer approaches adopted incrementally.
