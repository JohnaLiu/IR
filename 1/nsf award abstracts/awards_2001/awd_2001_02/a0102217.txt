This Americas Program award will provide support for
              cooperative research between Dr. William D. Jones of the University of
              Rochester and Dr. Juventino J. Garcia Alejandre of the Universidad Nacional
              Autonoma de Mexico to do a two-year study of new methods for the cleavage of
              carbon-carbon bonds using transition metal complexes.  A portion of this
              support is being provided by NSF's Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
              Program.

The goal of this project is to discover new compounds that can
              cleavage carbon-carbon bonds in a variety of aromatic and aliphatic molecules.
              The project will benefit from the complementary expertise of the collaborators,
              with the U.S. researchers providing the necessary equipment to analyze and
              characterize the compounds, and the Mexican researchers providing their
              substantial synthetic capabilities and reaction product characterization.  The
              cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds by transition metal compounds is one of the
              greatest challenges to organometallic chemists.  Only a few examples of this
              difficult reaction have been reported to date.  Consequently, this project has
              the potential to increase our understanding of these important chemical
              processes.
