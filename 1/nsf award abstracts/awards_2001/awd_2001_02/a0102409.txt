Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on
              the
properties of nuclear matter in extreme environments, such as
              high
temperatures or high density. Phase transitions are expected in
              these
situations between conventional matter approximating the interior of
              a
large nucleus and new, highly exotic large-scale states of matter in
              which
there may be superfluidity, superconductivity and plasmas of
              unconfined
quarks and gluons, the constituents of nuclear matter.
              Computer
simulations as well as precise, analytic methods based on the theory
              of
symmetries, will be employed to search for these new phenomena.
              These
studies are important because they may tell us about conditions in
              the
early universe.
