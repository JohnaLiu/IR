              Abstract
Shlyakhtenko

Shlyakhtenko will study classes of operator algebras
              arising in connection
with Voiculescu's free probability theory.  The main
              emphasis of this
research is placed on the study of operator-valued free
              random
variables and operator algebras that they generate.  Analysis of
              these
von Neumann algebras is intimately tied with the goal of
classification
              of free Araki-Woods factors, which are free probability
analogs of ITPFI type
              III factors.  Such analysis is also important
for understanding of subfactors
              and automorphisms of amalgamated free
product algebras.  One of the goals of
              the present research is to
develop free entropy-based techniques for dealing
              with operator-valued
random variables.

Free probability theory is a highly
              non-commutative parallel to basic
probability theory.  Matrix-valued random
              variables (such as random
matrices) naturally fit in the non-commutative
              probability framework;
the asymptotic behavior of large random matrices is
              well-modeled by
matrix-valued free random variables.  Applications are in
              mathematics
to the theory of operator algebras, subfactors, ergodic theory,
              as
well as the theory of random matrices, which have connections with
certain
              physical models.
