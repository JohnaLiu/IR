The
              central theme of this project is to explore as thoroughly as
possible the
              significance of the Jones-Witten and Vassiliev
invariants to knots, links, and
              3-manifolds as topological
structures. To be more specific, we will study the
              thermodynamic
limit of the colored Jones polynomial using various
              probabilistic
models; to explore beyond a simple formulation of the
              Casson
invariant we found; to understand the congruence relation
              among
Ohtsuki's invariants through congruence subgroups of the modular
group;
              to find the normal form of a degree 1 map from a knot
complement to another
              knot complement; to study the cohomology of
knot complexes; to explore the
              applicability of classical
techniques in 3-manifold topology to the study of
              Vassiliev
invariants; and to continue the study of value and
              root
distributions of the Jones polynomial.

The phenomenon of knotting is a
              fundamental feature of the space
that we live in, and knot theory is thus an
              important part of
mankind's scientific knowledge because it is aimed
              at
understanding the interplay of mathematical formulae and space
structures.
              It is no wonder that concepts and tools originated
from knot theory have been
              used in many areas of mathematics, as
well as in chemistry, biology, physics,
              and computer science. For
example, geneticists utilize knot theory to
              understand the
processes of DNA replication and the function of enzymes
              that
"unknot" DNA strands, and chemists use knot theory to understand
and
              distinguish between different types of molecules. Our ability
to discern
              different knots could well be served as a test of our
scientific understanding
              of space structures.
