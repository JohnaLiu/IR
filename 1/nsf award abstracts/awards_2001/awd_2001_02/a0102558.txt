Abstract    :
              Research shows that direct experiences with nature have beneficial effects on
              people's physical, cognitive, and emotional well-being.  Yet what happens
              psychologically when advanced technologies augment human/nature interactions? 
              Grounded in Value-Sensitive Design, this project represents an early, cohesive,
              and rigorous effort to answer this question.  At the heart of this project lies
              five empirical studies.  Study 1 involves a room with an augmented "window"
              view (a video plasma display of a real-time local nature scene).  Study 2
              involves whether it matters psychologically that an augmentation of a natural
              scene occurs in real-time.  Study 3 involves robot "pets" in the lives of
              children and adolescents.  Study 4 involves robot "pets" as possible companions
              for the elderly.  Study 5 involves a "telegarden" (a telerobotic installation
              that allows Web users to garden by controlling a remote industrial robot arm). 
              A diverse range of physiological, behavioral, and social-cognitive data are
              collected over short-term and longer-term conditions.  In the coming years,
              augmented reality will become part of our everyday lives, and pervasive across
              diverse fields, such as architecture, education, gerontology, recreation, and
              ecommerce.  This project contributes proactively to the design and use - from
              an ethical stance - of this emerging technology.
