Abstract    :
              Richard Matzner will carry out research in gravitational physics
              and
relativity, utilizing the tools of mathematical analysis, comparison
              to
observation, and computational modeling. He will apply these techniques
to
              understanding the possible configurations of massive objects as
described in
              general relativity, concentrating on black holes. He will
study the way in
              which these objects can be described in computational
terms, and the dynamics
              of these objects in interaction. 

The main part of this work will
              concentrate on developing evolutions of
black hole interactions. These are the
              strongest possible gravitational
sources, and will produce strong
              gravitational wave events. They are a
testbed in which our understanding of
              strong gravitational fields is
exercised, and in which new theoretical
              concepts are developed. They are
a difficult computational problem (large
              operation counts, large
numbers of field variables), and require special
              techniques, very
careful numerical handling, and very large computational
              resources.
Thus they are an excellent domain to develop new
              computational
infrastructure. And they may provide detailed predictions of
              the
waveforms detected in the current and in future generations
              of
gravitational wave detectors.
