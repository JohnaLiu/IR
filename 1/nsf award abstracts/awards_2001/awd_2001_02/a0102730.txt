Abstract    :
              A conference on the "Chemistry of Supramolecules and Assemblies" will be held at
              the end of July 2001 at Connecticut College as part of the Gordon Research
              Conference series. This conference will focus on the chemistry, properties and
              reactions of supramolecules and supramolecular assemblies; topics of current
              interest as they relate to such issues as (i) building blocks of extended 2D
              and 3D colloidal crystals, (ii) nanostructured and layered materials, (iii)
              surfactants and DNA, (iv) assembly of molecules and polymers into thin films,
              (v) functional dendrimers, (vi) vesicles, emulsions, mono- and bi-layers,
              micro-emulsions and liquid crystals.

Graduate and undergraduate students
              invited to participate at this conference will gain a valuable experience
              through informal interactions with more seasoned investigators, given the
              nature and practice of these conferences.
