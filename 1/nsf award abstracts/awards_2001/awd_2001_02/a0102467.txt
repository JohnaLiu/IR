Abstract    :
              This Nanoscale Exploratory Research (NER) project aims to design, synthesize,
              and assemble  organic molecules.  Two specific areas will be addressed. 
              Firstly, by creating new types of molecules (for example that form discotic
              liquid crystals) with specific noncovalent interactions, a scheme for
              interfacing self-assembled, organic conductors with gold surfaces will be
              achieved. Secondly, these interconnections will serve to orient dipolar columns
              assembled on surfaces creating macroscopic polar order, which is a prerequisite
              for creating nanodevices for ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric
              applications.
%%%
A major goal of nanotechnology is the creation of molecular
              systems such as one dimensional conductors from discotic liquid crystals that
              can  serve as a springboard for multidisciplinary research aimed at developing
              nanoscale devices. The types of devices to be explored include piezoelectric,
              ferroelectric, pyroelectric, and nonlinear optical. Students trained in these
              areas will be compete well for academic and industrial jobs.
