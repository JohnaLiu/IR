Abstract    :
              Morris Brown College requests as Planning Grant of $50,000 form the National
              Science
Foundation to support TranSMET -Phase I, a period of academic
              self-assessment,
understanding, and planning around those issues of
              infrastructure, faculty and student
preparedness that pose barriers to desired
              student outcomes in the science, math, engineering,
and technology
              disciplines. The 10 month planning phase is designed to culminate in 1)
              a
comprehensive five-year proposal that will catalyze the pedagogical
              reformation of Morris
Brown College by 2) conducting a thorough analysis of
              the College's SMET infrastructure and
programs and to develop a realistic and
              workable plan for implementing changes; and 3 )
developing a process of
              consistent assessment and evaluation of SMET programs. With the
formation of
              TranSMET Morris Brown College plans to design a series of three
              retreats
(meetings and workshops). Phase I of the project will culminate in a
              complete analysis of its
current SMET infrastructure, the formation of a
              permanent assessment and evaluation process
for all present and future SMET
              programs, and fmally the development of a comprehensive
multi-year proposal to
              increase minority participation in the SMET "knowledge workforce."
