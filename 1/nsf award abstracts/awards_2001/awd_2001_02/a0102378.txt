Abstract    :
              The University of Hawai'i at Hilo, on behalf of the state of Hawai'i, has
              requested NSF
support for a planning grant designed to help Hawai'i set
              priorities for the improvement
of the state's basic science and engineering
              research infrastructure. The project's
objective is to design a statewide
              science and technology (S &T) plan that will stimulate
economic opportunities
              and wealth building capacity. The planning process will examine
activities
              that have the potential to:  (1) affect greater participation in academic
              research
and development (R&D) and (2) significantly improve the status of
              science and
technology (S&T) education and workforce development. The planning
              process will
analyze the state's current S&T infrastructure and inventory
              current research personnel
and facilities. This analysis includes identifying:
              S&T areas of current research
excellence as well as areas with the potential
              for future national R&D competitiveness.
The planning process will result in a
              coordinated state-wide effort to improve academic
R&D capabilities in targeted
              disciplines, enhance training and education for students in
science and
              engineering, and increase efforts to promote transfer of technology from
              the
state's universities to Hawai'i's private and public sectors.
