Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funding for carrying out two concurrently operating
              Conferences.  One Conference addresses experimental QCD and high energy
              interaction topics.  The topics of current interests are:  Higgs boson
              searches, heavy flavor physics, search for particles beyond the Standard Model,
              QCD properties of W and Z production, low x physics and diffraction, heavy ion
              physics, and new trends in physics.

The other Conference deals with
              electroweak interactions and unified theories.  The subjects are: Standard
              Model tests, searches for the Higgs boson, Heavy flavor physics, CP violation,
              Neutrino physics and search for neutrino oscillations, theories beyond the
              Standard Model.
