Abstract    :
              0102139  Bryers  The objective of this research is to quantify surface chemistry
              effects on the conformation and subsequent availability of mixtures of adsorbed
              contaminants for bacterial degradation.  The added influence of ambient humic
              acids on the adsorption conformations will also be determined.  Three organic
              wastes are considered: naphthalene, cyanuric acid and trichloroethylene.  This
              research has two major objectives.  First, carry out degradation studies (both
              in suspension and as biofilm culture) of the three selected organic wastes, in
              prescribed mixtures, both with and without the presence of known amounts of
              humic acids.  The added influence of ambient humic acids on the adsorption
              conformations and bacterial responses will be quantified.  Second, develop
              model substrata that mimic inorganic soil substrata.  Also, determine the
              spatial conformation and molecular distributions of various mixtures of the
              three organic contaminants exposed to these different "mineral mimic"
              substrata.  In addition, quantify individual species' metabolic responses when
              mixed cultures are exposed to these various substrata.  This research is
              expected to provide fundamental information that is critical to affecting
              efficient treatment protocols for contaminated land and water. ***
