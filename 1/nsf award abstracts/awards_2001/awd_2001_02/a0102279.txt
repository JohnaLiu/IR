The Topology of Open Manifolds with
              Nonnegative Ricci Curvature
Christina Sormani

Dr. Sormani proposes to study
              the topology of complete manifolds with
nonnegative Ricci curvature and their
              limit spaces.  In particular she
plans to investigate various approaches to
              Milnor's conjecture that
the fundamental group of an open manifold with
              nonnegative Ricci
curvature is finitely generated.  She also plans to study
              the higher
dimensional homology of these spaces.  Techniques which will
              be
employed involve Gromov-Hausdorff limits, the almost rigidity theory
of
              Cheeger-Colding, and Busemann functions.  In particular, the
properness of
              Busemann functions on these manifolds will be
investigated.  It should be
              noted that there are direct applications
of this project to the theory of
              topological censorship in general
relativity.  The condition of nonnegative
              Ricci curvature on
space-time is called the null energy condition and it
              arises in the
Einstein equation.


Roughly speaking, Dr. Sormani proposes
              to study the existence and
prevalence of holes in a space which has no
              boundary, extends to
infinity and has a condition imposed upon the way in
              which it can
bend.  The universe we live in is such a space.  Simpler examples
              are
cylinders (i.e. tubes) and paraboloids (i.e. bowls).  The cylinder has
a
              hole but the paraboloid does not.  The spaces studied in this
project are of
              arbitrary dimension and so the holes come in various
dimensions as well.  The
              universe is one such higher dimensional space
and its holes, which may or may
              not exist, are often called wormholes.
By furthering our understanding of this
              geometric problem, it is hoped
that we will further our understanding of the
              universe.
