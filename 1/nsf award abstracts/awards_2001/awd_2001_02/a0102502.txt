Abstract    :
              CHICOS (California HIgh school Cosmic ray ObServatory) is a
collaborative
              project involving Caltech, Cal State Northridge, and
local high school physics
              teachers to site an array of particle
detectors at  high schools in the Los
              Angeles area.   The array will
operate as a coordinated network and will be
              capable of detecting
and characterizing a sample of the highest energy
              elementary
particles ever observed.  The project will offer students
              and
teachers in local high schools a unique opportunity to collaborate
with
              researchers at Caltech and address fundamental issues at the
forefront of
              present-day astrophysics and particle physics.
