Abstract    :
              Chief objectives of this bi-national workshop are to: exchange latest research
              findings in vibration and noise engineering; invite industry to identify key
              research questions and trends that must be urgently addressed; and form
              collaborative teams and provide an opportunity for a closer interaction between
              leading U.S. and Indian experts. The 3-day joint symposium will be held at the
              Center for Automotive Research at The Ohio State University in the fall of
              2001. The symposium builds on a similarly focused small workshop that took
              place at IIT Delhi, India in 1996.  Pre and post workshop activities will
              include industrial R&D visits and short courses.  Technical topics include
              vibro-acoustic analyses of structures, equipment and vehicles, machine
              dynamics, signal processing and diagnostics, spatial domain measurements,
              non-linear problems, computational techniques, dynamic design concepts, passive
              and active damping, smart actuators and sensors, and the like.  A special issue
              of the Journal of Sound and Vibration will be published based on the articles
              presented at the workshop.  This symposium intends to identify common
              international interests and priorities in the area of noise and vibration
              control and focus on important relevant scientific issues.
