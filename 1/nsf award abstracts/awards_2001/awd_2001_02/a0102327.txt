Abstract    :
              This project aims at greater understanding of dislocations in GaN. The approach
              involves generation of dislocations with known Burgers vectors and known
              character, and the study of how these dislocations propagate during thin film
              growth. Additionally, the project addresses how dislocation propagation is
              influenced by orientation of the growth surface, particularly during lateral
              epitaxial overgrowth (LEO). Electrical and optical properties of these
              dislocations will also be examined. Specially designed grain boundaries will
              consist of ordered arrays of dislocations which are self-aligning and
              self-stabilizing. Variation of misorientation angle will be used to give
              control over dislocation spacing and character of the dislocations while
              variation of the boundary plane will be used for Burger vector control. Having
              many aligned dislocations in a single specimen gives the benefit of meaningful
              statistical analysis.

The project addresses basic research issues in a
              topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. These
              studies will improve the fundamental understanding of defects in Gallium
              Nitride, which is a key material to advanced microelectronics and photonics. An
              important feature of the program is the integration of research and education
              through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically
              significant area, and education outreach activities to promote diversity.
