Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to conduct an intensive two-year sampling program
              of the fishes of Fiji.  Data from this project will be combined with
              information from previous collections to establish a comprehensive list of the
              species present and provide information on the habitats of the species and
              characteristics of the biological communities.  Although Fiji lies within the
              region supporting the most diverse coral-reef fish fauna in the world, its
              fishes are not well known and estimates of the diversity of fishes inhabiting
              the Fiji Islands are grossly underestimated.

Collecting efforts will
              concentrate on reef and shore fishes, and include sampling in reefs, mangroves,
              seagrass beds, mud flats, and rocky and sandy shores.  In addition to making
              collections using SCUBA at depths of 30 meters or less, a pilot sampling of
              fishes will be conducted to a depth of 120 meters using closed circuit
              rebreather technology.  Specimens will be photographed in the field and
              returned to the University of Hawaii for identification.

The fish specimens
              collected will be available for future systematic and biogeographic studies,
              and will provide information on biodiversity, habitat specificity, and
              characteristics of Indo-Pacific marine communities.  An interactive, searchable
              database system on the fishes of Fiji will be developed.  The database will
              contain basic taxonomic data for each taxon (authorship, location of type
              specimen, synonyms), major references for identification, diagnostic
              characteristics, distributional information, photographs, and listings of major
              museum holdings of specimens from Fiji.  A book on the fishes of Fiji is
              planned as a follow-up project.
