Abstract    :
              Interest in the solid state sciences has undergone explosive growth in recent
              years due to the broadly based recognition of the technological importance and
              scientific challenges involved in the discovery and study of new materials, and
              due to the influx of scientists from other disciplines into various areas of
              materials research and development. The 2001 Electron Distribution & Chemical
              Bonding Gordon Research Conference will explore the nature of chemical bonding
              as the glue that holds atoms together and also gives materials most of their
              properties. The goal of the conference is to facilitate international
              collaborations and  information exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers
              with interests in solid state science and materials research and development. 
              The NSF funds will be used to support the attendance of  graduate students,
              postdoctoral scholars, and junior faculty.

The materials research and
              development  community continues to have direct impact on technological
              advances of high significance to society by designing, synthesizing and
              characterizing new materials such as magnetic,  electronic, and biomolecular
              materials.
