Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
              FY2001.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
              protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
              not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
              opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
              microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
              established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
              research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
              fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
              research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
              of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
              locations. 

The research and training plan is entitled "Can Bacteria Move by
              Slime Extrusion?  The physics of A-type motility in Mxyococcus xanthus." 
              Myxococcus xanthus moves by gliding utilizing two distinct genetic mechanisms:
              Social(S) and Adventurous(A) motility.  This is a study of A-type motility
              using a slime extrusion model based on a nozzle-like organelle discovered in
              cyanobacteria.  A theoretical model is being explored and experiments performed
              to determine if this type of mechanism can drive A-motility.
