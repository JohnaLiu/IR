Abstract    :
              The project focuses on sensing, and proposes to develop new ways for fast shape
              and appearance sensing, 3D tracking, recognition, and compression. The sensing
              approach proposed is based on dynamic active  triangulation, with structured
              light illumination swept across the scene., allowing 100-200 range maps per
              second.
