Abstract    :
              The program coordinators propose to organize a workshop titled "The Internet as
              a Large-Scale Complex System" to be held at the Santa Fe Institute in March
              2001.  The main purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum for disseminating
              relevant accomplishments and discussing future challenges associated with
              trying to gain a solid understanding of the dynamics and evolution of the
              global Internet from a broad and still unconventional perspective-complex
              systems dynamics.  The coordinators plan to bring together network researchers
              with a group of distinguished researchers with expertise ranging from
              statistical physics, dynamical systems theory, and control theory to
              biological, physical and social systems.  Select contributions from invited
              speakers will be published as part of the SFI book series by Oxford University
              Press.
