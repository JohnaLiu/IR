Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
              FY2001.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
              protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
              not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
              opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
              microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
              established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
              research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
              fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
              research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
              of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
              locations. 

The research and training plan is entitled "Conversations
              between bacterium and squid:  Studying the genetics behind V. fischeri's 
              response to its symbiotic host, E. scolopes.  Colonization of the squid E.
              scolopes by its bacterial symbiont, V. fischeri, requires the bacterial sensor
              kinase RscS.  This research tests the hypothesis that RscS regulates other
              genes essential to the symbiosis by identifying these genes using a variety of
              molecular methods.  Further, laser-scanning confocal microscopy is being used
              to identify where in the symbiosis process RscS is required.
