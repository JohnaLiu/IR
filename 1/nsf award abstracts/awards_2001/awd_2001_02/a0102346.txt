Abstract    :
              Funds from this award will be used to help students and other
              junior
investigators to participate in the Quark Matter 2001 Conference,
              to
be held January 14-20, 2001.  With the recent commencement of
data-taking
              at the newly commissioned Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC), this
              conference will be a very timely milestone
marking first results in the search
              for the quark-gluon plasma.
