Abstract    :
              Partial support for participant costs associated with the VIIth Cyanobacterial
              Workshop,2001 is being provided. Funds are being used to cover: a portion of
              the expenses for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, assistant
              professors who will run the program as speakers and session chairs; a foreign
              keynote speaker; two invited speakers and up to four senior scientists in
              financial need. The 2001 Workshop is being held at the Asilomar Conference
              Center in Pacific Grove, CA with the title "A Signal Event" and the theme of
              signal transduction. The Keynote Address will be given by Dr Nicole Tandeau de
              Marsac, the Head of the Unite de Physiologie Microbienne, Institut Pasteur,
              Paris, France. The address will focus on aspects of protein phosphorylation and
              its role in signaling processes. The importance of signal transduction pathways
              -as becoming realized through the complete genome analysis of more than five
              different cyanobacteria -will be highlighted throughout the sessions. A session
              on genomics will discuss data derived from recent completion of the genomes of
              Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133 -the largest microbial genome sequenced to date
              -and Anabaena sp.PCC 7120. Further sessions will emphasize recent  developments
              in nitrogen fixation, differentiation, photosynthesis and cyanobacterial
              physiology and molecular ecology.
