This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019. 
              The goal of this project is to design and synthesize novel TiO2-based nanotube
              p-n junction photocatalysts.  The principal investigators have combined the p-n
              junction principle and concepts of template preparation of nanomaterials
              toyield a new general route for preparing nanotube p-n junction photocatalysts.
               Through this process, they will further understand the nucleation and growth
              of very small diameter semiconductor nanotubes. The morphology of these TiO2
              nanotubes will be analyzed. The photocatalytic activity will be evaluated by
              examining the destruction of representative organic pollutants in the gas
              phase. 

The proposed research is expected to improve the quantum efficiency
              for photocatalytic destruction of environmental pollutants by providing a basis
              for designing and constructing TiO2-based nanotube photocatalysts. An important
              feature of the multidisciplinary research team is the integration of research
              and education through broader academic and research training of students in
              fundamental materials science, environmental science, and related technological
              areas.
