Abstract    :
              Partial funding is requested for a FASEB Summer Research Conference, " The
              calpain gene family in health and disease" to be held June 30th to July 5th,
              2001, at Big Mountain Resort, Whitefish, Montana. The conference will comprise
              30 minutes oral presentations by 25 to 30 experts on various aspects of the
              calpain family of intracellular proteases, as well as poster presentations from
              graduate students and post-doctoral trainees. It will draw participants from a
              wide variety of disciplines and backgrounds, since calpains are involved in
              many physiologic and pathologic processes.

Half-day speaker sessions will
              cover the following topics: calpain structure/function studies; novel calpain
              genes; non-mammalian calpains; molecular and cellular aspects of calpain
              regulation; physiologic functions of the calpains; genetic calpainopathies, and
              other pathologies associated with calpains.

While focussing on the calpains,
              the meeting will attract a broad range of investigators, allowing input from
              many perspectives.  From example, studies on model systems (C. elegans,
              Drosophila) may provide insights on calpain functions in mammalian cells, and
              the effects of its loss in calpainopathesis ( muscular dystrophy type 2A, type
              II diabetes).

This is the second FASEB Summer Conference on Calpains. The
              first conference, held in 1999, was attended by over 110 participants. All
              talks and posters were well attended, and the conferees overwhelmingly voted to
              have another meeting in 2001
