              Abstract

This proposal was received in response to NSF-0019. Research is
              planned in which phenacenes, which are ribbon-like molecules of fused rings,
              are examined for their potential to reinforce polymer matrices with
              unprecedented effectiveness. The research activities incl3de synthesis of the
              desired phenacenes in monodisperse populations of selected lengths, preparation
              of microscopic mechanical test specimens, and small-scale mechanical testing to
              demonstrate the hypothesis that the strength and stiffness of nanocomposites
              made with phenacenes are significantly higher than those of the corresponding
              nanocomposites made with carbon nanotubes. The research is a collaboration that
              combines fundamental chemistry with materials engineering and that targets
              undergraduate women being trained in the basic physical sciences for the field
              of post-graduate engineering.
