Abstract    :
              Theoretical research will be carried out on the properties
of objects with
              strong gravitational fields, such as neutron
stars, black holes, and the
              Universe as a whole, with a particular
focus on understanding the
              gravitational waves that such objects
produce, and on developing and extending
              analytic approximation methods
in general relativity to study these objects. 
              The particular
objects to be studied include (i) newly born neutron stars
              in
supernovae explosions, (ii) neutron stars and/or black holes
spiralling
              into supermassive black holes in distant galaxies, and
(iii) the dynamics of
              the very early Universe in models motivated by
string theory with extra
              spatial dimensions and membranes.
These studies will be useful in teaching us
              about the physics of
relativistic gravitational fields, particularly when
              combined with
future observational data from gravitational wave detectors and
              other
sources.
