Abstract    :
              This research addresses the question of atoms interacting with light in a
              radically nonperturbative, ultrahigh laser intensity range from 1017 W/cm2 to
              1019 W/cm2.  The science has direct bearing on a number of topics, including
              new multi-electron phenomena, nonperturbative magnetic field-atom interactions,
              relativistic continuum dynamics, the breakdown of the semiclassical WKB
              approximation in strong field physics, and high-energy radiation from
              laser-atom interactions.  The atomic physics and laser technology in the
              proposal has a direct impact on fourth generation XUV and X-ray radiation light
              sources, with applications as wide-ranging as device lithography and single
              molecule x-ray diffraction.  The education component of the proposal is
              directed toward high-school and college student perceptions of physics and
              addresses the new pedagogy behind real-world, electronic teaching resources.
