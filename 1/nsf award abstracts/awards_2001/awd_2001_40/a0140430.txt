Abstract    :
              This RUI award provides support for a research program on collisions of cold,
              dense samples of Rydberg atoms. The Rydberg atoms in this environment are
              strongly coupled by the dipole interaction. Two novel features define this
              environment. First, the atoms move a distance that is significantly less than
              their mean separation during the time the collision lasts. Second, the mean
              atomic separation is less than the impact parameter, indicating that many-body
              effects are important. The interactions of a dense sample of cold Rydberg atoms
              are therefore less like those in a "normal" gas, and more like those
              characteristic of a diffuse liquid or disordered solid. The term "frozen gas"
              has been used to describe this environment.   Two major areas of research will
              be pursued:  1)  Exciton processes in a frozen gas, in which various
              predictions of an exciton diffusion model for migration of population away from
              close atoms will be investigated and 2) Preliminary investigations of
              multiphoton radiatively assisted collisions in the many-body regime.   By
              virtue of being at an undergraduate institution with a significant number of
              physics majors, this research program offers educational preparation for
              students wishing to continue on to graduate school or enter the advanced
              high-tech workforce.
