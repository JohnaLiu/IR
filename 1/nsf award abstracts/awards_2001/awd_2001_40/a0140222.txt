Abstract    :
              0140222  Parker  The Water Science and Technology Board (WSTB) of the National
              Academies provides a focal point for studies related to water resources and the
              role of environmental engineering in this context.  The Board's objective is to
              provide information to improve the scientific and technological basis for
              resolving important questions and issues relating to the management of water
              resources.  A major function of the WSTB is to conduct studies and sponsor
              workshops and conferences that can be utilized for program planning purposes. 
              In this way, the WSTB provides a means for coordination of research plans with
              other Federal Agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the
              U. S. Geological Survey, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U. S.
              Department of Energy, and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers.  ***
