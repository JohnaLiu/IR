ABSTRACT

The Sz. Nagy
              Dilation Theorem, which models a contraction
operator on Hilbert space as the
              adjoint of an isometry 
restricted to an invariant subspace has had a profound
              
influence on operator theory and its  applications.  The 
existence of the
              Agler boundary for families of 
representations and of boundary
              representations 
(not necessarily irreducible) and the C-star envelope 
for
              operator algebras are abstract generalizations of 
the Sz.-Nagy dilation
              theorem which naturally encode 
Pick interpolation and in many cases commutant
              lifting. 
They also provide a  natural setting for versions of 
Beurling's
              theorem.  The Agler boundary and C-star envelope 
have been explicitly
              computed for the families of 
completely contractive representations of the
              algebra of 
multipliers of  symmetric Fock space, the algebra 
of multipliers
              of the  Dirichlet space,  as well as 
quotients of the disc and annulus 
              algebra. The PI will 
investigate situations in which strong versions of Pick
              
interpolation, Beurling's theorem, and commutant lifting
hold as a function
              of the complexity of the corresponding
Agler boundary and C-star envelope. The
              investigation 
will make contact with function theory, special functions,
              
differential equations, and the general theory of operator 
algebras. Thre
              are also plans to continue studying
factorization of polynomials in several
              non-commuting 
variables pursuing the theme that one-variable results
most
              naturally generalize to the non-commutative setting.

Operator theory has a
              history of rich interplay with 
engineering and physics as well as other vital
              areas of 
mathematics including complex function theory and algebraic
              
geometry. Originally developed as a tool to study integral 
and differential
              equations arising in physics,  operator theory, 
operator algebras, and
              operator systems play an important role 
in modern quantum physics. Four
              fundamental themes in operator 
theory, Sz.-Nagy dilation, Pick interpolation,
               commutant 
lifting, and Beurling's theorem are now basic technology in
              
systems theory which in turn has important applications in image 
processing
              and control theory - the mathematics behind automatic 
controllers such as
              autopilots. A major emphasis in the proposed 
work is generalizations of these
              themes with a view toward 
applications to systems theory, control theory,
              operator algebras, 
and function theory. McCullough will also study
              factorization 
problems for polynomials in several non-commuting variables.
              
(Here xy may not equal yx.) This investigation is
expected to make
              connection with non-commutative algebraic 
geometry and  Linear Matrix
              Inequalities or LMI's which 
frequently arise in engineering applications.
