Abstract    :
              This award supports the purchase of eight plant growth chambers and related
              equipment to be used for studies of major crop plants including maize, rice and
              tomato, as well as studies of other plants whose genetics and physiology are of
              general interest.  These chambers are suited for high-throughput and
              large-scale projects that often require well-defined plant growth conditions,
              including light, temperature and humidity, or experimental treatments that are
              not possible without modern growth chambers.  Planned uses include studies of
              plant-pathogen interactions, nuclear-plastid signaling, and light signal
              transduction in several major crop plants and in Arabidopsis.  Use of such
              chambers allows investigators to standardize plant growth conditions that often
              vary widely from one research group to another. Such standardization
              facilitates verification of results by other investigators, as well as new
              investigations that build on the results of previous work.
