Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for the continuation of a research project in the
              study of Bose-Einstein (BE) condensation in cold lithium atoms.   Both Li-6 and
              Li-7 and mixtures of these two isotopes will be studied.  BE condensation in
              Li-7 is particularly interesting because one of the spin states has attractive
              interactions, and some of the work will focus on the continuation of studies of
              this condensate, particularly the effect of the application of a magnetic field
              to produce Feshbach resonances.   A Feshbach resonance will also be used to
              tune the interaction in a pair of Li-6 spin states, with the goal of producing
              an s-wave Cooper pairing phase transition.  Finally, two-photon
              photoassociation to a molecular ground state in Li-7 will be used to change the
              interaction strength with the goal of producing and trapping ultracold
              molecules of diatomic lithium that may then undergo BE condensation.
