Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a group at Vanderbilt University for a
              program of research and education in experimental elementary particle physics
              based on several heavy quark experiments. They are finishing up the FOCUS
              experiment at Fermilab, preparing for BTeV, a second-generation B-factory
              experiment, also at Fermilab and considering working on CLEO-c at Cornell.
              Heavy flavor physics yields information about the strong and electroweak
              interactions, quark mixing and CP asymmetry and may lead to hints concerning
              the source of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, one of the most
              fundamental questions in science. 

FOCUS is a fixed-target, charm production
              experiment searching for D0`D0 mixing in semielectronic and hadronic decays,
              searching for rare and forbidden charm decays, studying charm baryon
              spectroscopy and semileptonic charm decays. BTeV is a Tevatron collider
              experiment that will study charm and beauty decays in order to confront the
              Standard Model explanation of CP violation in B0 and Bs mesons, Bs mixing and
              rare b decays. The CLEO-c program includes precision measurements of charm and
              QCD physics in the vs = 3-5 GeV CM energy range.
