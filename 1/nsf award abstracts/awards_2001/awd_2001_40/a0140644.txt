This award provided support for a workshop entitled
              "Analytical Instrumentation for the New Millennium - Biological Sciences" to be
              held Dec 2-5, 2001 in Tucson, Arizona. The workshop will bring together
              scientists with broad interests in biological measurements, including both the
              biologists who need the measurements and the instrument developers who design
              and build instrumentation. The format of the workshop will include highlight
              presentations by cutting-edge researchers who will conclude with a brief
              description of goals for the future and the major obstacles to be faced in
              meeting those goals. These presentations will be followed by breakout sessions
              to critique/evaluate the proposed goals and obstacles. The expected outcomes of
              the workshop are a report to be written jointly by the breakout leaders and
              organizers and presentations to be made at national meetings.  This workshop is
              jointly supported by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the
              Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
