Abstract    :
              The investigator is carrying out a program in the theory of automorphic
              
representations.  The program is to find  different  methods to produce
              
automorphic funtoriality and then relate such methods.  The point of finding
              such 
connections is  to determine automorphic-type formulae( such as periods
              or theta 
integrals) for special values of automorphic L functions. 
              Specifically the 
techniques of the regular trace formula (as well as the
              relative trace formula) 
and the use of the converse theorem produce examples
              of such functorial lifting. 
The investigator relates these techniques to
              theta correspondence and the 
descent method.  Such new techniques make it
              possible to determine the 
nonvanishing of the new liftings in terms of
              special values.
  
The motivation of the above work is  to have an analytic
              formalism to study 
the special values of certain automorphic L functions.  It
              turns out that some of 
the most famous problems in number theory (such as
              Fermat' s last theorem  and 
more generally the determination of integral
              solutions to polynomial identities) 
have as a goal the concrete analysis of
              such L functions as above. The 
information given by the investigator's
              approach may be useful in the qualitative 
study of these L functions.
