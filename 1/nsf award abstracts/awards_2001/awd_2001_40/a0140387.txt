Abstract    :
              The interactions of atmospheric flows with mountains are an important issue in
              atmospheric sciences.  Orography plays a role in both local weather as well as
              influencing the larger scale flow.  The isolation of the mountainous Island of
              Hawaii provides a natural laboratory for studies of the impacts of orography. 
              

In 1990 a cooperative project among several researchers, the Hawaiian
              Rainband Project (HaRP), was executed to study the influence of the island on
              local weather and fundamental mountain/atmospheric flow interactions.  To date,
              most HaRP analyses have focused on the airflow, thermodynamic fields and radar
              echoes on the windward side and the evolution of early morning rain bands
              offshore of Hilo. 

In this project the Principal Investigator (PI) will
              extend analysis to the airflow along the windward coast and offshore as well as
              circulations on the lee side.  Furthermore, the PI will simulate the complete
              diurnal cycle of the island-scale airflow and weather under different
              trade-wind conditions (e.g. strong trades vs. weak trades; low trade-wind
              inversion height vs. high trade-wind inversion height) using an advanced
              mesoscale numerical model.  Analysis of observations will be used to validate
              model results. 

Results from modeling studies will improve basic
              understanding of the diurnal and local effects for the island of Hawaii under
              the summer trade-wind weather.  These results potentially can have benefits in
              helping to interpret airflow in other complex terrain situations.
