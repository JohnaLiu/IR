Abstract    :
              The behavior of complex natural systems results from the coupling of causal
              dynamical evolution with random events. This work is a coordinated experimental
              and theoretical investigation of how nonlinear dynamical processes shape the
              statistics of multiple noise sources in moderately complex physical systems.
              The nonlinear processes on which this work will focus occur in optical fiber
              and consist of multi-order stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS), stimulated
              Brillouin scattering (SBS), and four-wave mixing (FWM) of polarization
              components of Q-switched laser pulses.  These processes are present or actively
              exploited in a wide range of applications such as frequency conversion, signal
              amplification and processing, and pulse compression. Understanding how these
              nonlinear processes shape noise is therefore of both practical and fundamental
              importance.
