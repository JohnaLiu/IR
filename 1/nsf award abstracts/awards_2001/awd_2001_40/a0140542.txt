Abstract    :
                 The investigator has discovered that, for extremely large input
   sizes,
              modern factorization algorithms such as the number-field sieve
   can be
              carried out with far less memory per processor than was
   previously
              believed. Consequently, for extremely large values of d,
   the number-field
              sieve can factor 3d-digit numbers at the same cost
   that was previously
              believed to be required for d-digit numbers. The
   investigator is studying
              the practical effectiveness of this
   discovery for small input sizes, such
              as 1024 bits and 1536 bits. The
   investigator is also continuing his
              research into the fundamental
   computational tools in commutative rings of
              Krull dimension 1.

   The number-field sieve is the best known attack on
              many public-key
   cryptosystems used to protect the secrecy and authenticity
              of
   Internet communications. Understanding the power of this algorithm is
 
               essential in choosing safe key sizes for the cryptosystems. If, for
  
              example, criminals can factor integers as large as 1024 bits, then
   users
              must choose key sizes larger than 1024 bits.
