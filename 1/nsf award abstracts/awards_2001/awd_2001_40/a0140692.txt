Abstract    :
              The investigator studies how local properties affect the global 
parameters of
              different combinatorial structures. This is a very 
general framework of the
              so called Turan number problems. 
The investigator emphasizes four different
              aspects
   1. To study the Turan numbers of triple systems and multigraphs,
              
as a tool to achieve a general theory for hypergraphs. 
   2. To study
              covering radius problems, especially concerning 
constant weight codes where
              Turan numbers naturally emerge.
   3. To study more general coding theory
              problems, like 
superimposed codes, identifying codes which lead to hypergraph
              
intersection problems.
   4. To find geometrical, and algebraic
              representations, like 
Lovasz' Shannon capacity bound, Ramanujan graphs,
              polarity graphs, 
Prague dimension of graphs, where Turan numbers naturally
              emerge.

Most finite problems can be formulated as extremal graph or
              
hypergraph problems. Extremal combinatorics applies a broad array 
of tools
              and results from other fields of mathematics like number 
theory, linear and
              commutative algebra, probability theory, 
geometry, and information theory. On
              the other hand it has a number 
of interesting applications in all parts of
              combinatorics, and in 
geometry, integer programming, computer science, coding
              theory, 
dimension theory of partially ordered sets,
              encryptions.
Applications of extremal combinatorics and coding theory in
              
computer science and communication theory are indispensable.
