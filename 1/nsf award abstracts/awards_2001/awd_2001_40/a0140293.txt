Abstract    :
              
This proposal deals with research activities that will lead to the detection
              of ultra-high energy cosmic rays to study their origin and identity.  The PI's
              proposal will enable him to cover the following
              responsibilities:
1.	Management, integration, and quality assurance of surface
              detector elements.
2.	Implementation of detector trigger and calibration
              schemes and refine software for event reconstruction.
Funding is recommended
              at a slightly reduced level, a level that will enable the PI to fulfill his
              commitment at the rate AUGER is progressing.
