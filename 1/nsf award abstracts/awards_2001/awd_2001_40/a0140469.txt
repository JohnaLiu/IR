This award to Texas A&M University provides instrumentation to
              update, improve and expand the capabilities of the TAMU Technical Support Group
              in conducting analysis of nutrients in seawater.  Specifically, it provides
              colorimeters, peristaltic pumps, a chart recorder, a computer, and components
              for data acquisition.  These shared-use systems will be of substantial
              advantage to marine scientists using this group to support their programs in
              ocean nutrient research during 2002 and future years.
