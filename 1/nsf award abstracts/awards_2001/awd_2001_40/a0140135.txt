Abstract    :
              This RUI activity focuses on two projects.  The first project uses a
              laser-cooling and trapping system for the measurement of metastable lifetimes
              in magneto-optically trapped krypton and argon, using a method of photon
              counting and metastable-state quenching to determine the single-atom
              spontaneous decay rate to a few percent.  The second project builds on an
              earlier discovery and characterization of one-dimensional spatiotemporal
              patterns in a novel dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) system, a class of
              high-voltage, ac-driven gaseous discharges that typically operate in the
              atmospheric pressure range and produce reactive chemical species and intense
              excimer fluorescence.   This pattern formation is of basic interest in the
              field of non-linear dynamics and may hold promise in various diagnostic and/or
              control schemes in DBD applications.
