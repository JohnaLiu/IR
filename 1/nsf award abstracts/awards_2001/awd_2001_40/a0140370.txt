Abstract    :
              In this project the investigators will carry out a set of experiments to study
              the physics of quantum communication. They will study two approaches to
              transmitting data by encoding it onto the quantum states of physical objects -
              either light fields or collections of atoms in a vapor.  The investigators will
              explore the use of macroscopic light pulses to represent each data bit. Special
              squeezed states of light will be used to increase the security while at the
              same time allowing accurate encoding and reading of the bits. Nonlinear-optical
              amplifiers will be used to create these states. This will be a generalization
              of current methods that use single photons to store each bit. Relative
              advantages and disadvantages of the methods for transmitting data securely will
              be explored.  In the other approach the investigators will study a class of
              systems that uses a macroscopic ensemble of atoms to represent quantum
              information. The atomic ensemble is excited in a way that lends itself to a
              description as a collective harmonic-oscillator mode, represented by a Bosonic
              degree of freedom. As such, the concepts of continuous-variable quantum
              information will play a role. The goal of this work will be to create quantum
              states of collective atomic ensemble variables by conditional measurement and
              to create entanglement between two such distant ensembles. This will set the
              stage for further development of quantum communication networks over long
              distances.
