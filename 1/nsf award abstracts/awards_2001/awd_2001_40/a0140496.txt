Abstract    :
              MEMS designers would like more functionality on a chip, akin to the VLSI
              technology comprising of hundreds of thousands of components on a chip, but
              they are currently handicapped with the limited design tools for Bio-MEMS
              design. A structured design methodology for Bio-MEMS can address many of the
              challenges currently facing Bio-MEMS design. The objective of this research is
              to develop analysis and design tools for device, reduced-order, and circuit
              modeling of Bio-MEMS for structured design of Bio-MEMS.

The objectives of
              device modeling are to develop mathematical models to include all significant
              microscopic effects in Bio-MEMS, develop fast and efficient scattered point and
              mixed-regime techniques for mixed-domain analysis of bio-fluidic devices. The
              objective of reduced-order modeling is to represent the device by a low-order
              model that can capture the functional behavior. Low-order models based on a
              weighted snap shot approach will be developed to capture multiple time scales
              encountered in Bio-MEMS. By identifying several Bio-fluidic components, that
              could form the basic building blocks for complex Bio-MEMS on a chip, and
              developing reduced-order models for these building blocks, circuit models will
              be developed to design large-scale biointegrated circuits on a chip.
