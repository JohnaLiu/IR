Mukhin

E. Mukhin studies the representation theory of affine
              Lie
algebras and their quantizations in several directions including
              the
theory of coinvariants of integrable representations of affine
Kac-Moody
              algebras (with  B. Feigin, M. Jimbo and T. Miwa), the theory
of
              finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine groups (with
E. Frenkel)
              and the functors between categories of representations of
Lie algebras and
              quantum groups defined by  Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov and
quantized
              Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations (with A. Varchenko). 

The project is
              expected to result in description of many features of
the beautiful
              algebraic-combinatorial structure related to
representation theory of complex
              semi-simple Lie algebras and their affine and
quantum analogs. In particular,
              this research has connections to many areas of
mathematics such as theory of
              symmetric functions and combinatorics of
Young tableaux, theory of special
              functions, exactly solvable lattice
models, conformal field theory, massive
              field theory in 1+1
dimensions, etc; as all these theories have symmetries
              described in
terms of Lie algebras of different kind.
