Abstract    :
              This project concerns the further development of Henson's logic
for structures
              based on metric spaces and, especially, the
continued application of this
              theory to problems in functional
analysis and in the geometry of metric
              spaces.  The syntax of
this logic is restricted to the class of positive
              bounded
formulas and the semantics of the logic uses an
              approximate
satisfaction relation.  Its potential role in analysis
              and
geometry is parallel to the role of ordinary first order logic in
the
              more algebraic aspects of mathematics.

During the past 40 years or more,
              techniques from logic have not
only clarified the foundations of mathematics,
              but they have
contributed new tools for solving mathematical problems. 
              These
tools have been especially effective in those areas of
mathematics that
              are close to algebra and number theory.  In this
project, C.  Ward Henson aims
              to make those tools from logic
equally effective in the areas of mathematics
              that are close to
topology, geometry, and analysis.
