Abstract    :
              A new era in gravitational wave detection is about to begin, with the completion
              of the three interferometers of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave
              Observatory, or LIGO.  The gravitational wave research group at Syracuse
              University intends to play a key role in LIGO's improvement and observing
              activities over the next three years.  They will carry out detector
              characterization activities to guide this work, will strive to understand the
              data produced by the interferometers, and will help optimize methods for
              searching for gravitational waves.  In support of these activities, they will
              devote their laboratory facilities at Syracuse to experiments that will
              investigate any anomalies that may be discovered in the instruments at the LIGO
              observatories. In addition, the group will develop a set of laboratory teaching
              stations, as the nucleus of a summer school for scientists new to the field of
              gravitational wave detection.

Once LIGO is collecting the sort of data for
              which it was designed, we will be in a position where dramatic new discoveries
              about the universe are possible.  The results of LIGO's initial data run could
              shed light on black holes, gamma ray bursts, neutron stars, and supernovae. 
              The instruments carrying out these observations have dramatically extended the
              state of the art of precision measurement technology.
