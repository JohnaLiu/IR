Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a group at Michigan State University for a
              program of research and education in experimental elementary particle physics
              based on the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton collider
              and on the ATLAS experiment at the proton-proton Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at
              Cern, Geneva. 

The MSU group formed the nucleus of the D0 experiment and one
              of the members of the group, H. Weerts, is currently a co-spokesman for the
              experiment. The group has major responsibilities to the Run II upgrades at each
              of the three levels of the trigger. They are actively engaged in a number of
              physics analyses, including top quark and QCD physics as well as searches for
              new phenomena. The group's work on ATLAS includes design and construction of
              the Level 2 trigger system as well as integrating it with the data acquisition
              system.

Members of the MSU group are introducing technical and intellectual
              expertise into the classroom for both physics and non-science majors and one of
              their members, B. Pope, is an active member of QuarkNet, the
              multi-institutional effort to involve high school teachers and their students
              in particle physics research.
