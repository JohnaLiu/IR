Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the study of the interactions of photons with negative
              ions in two series of experiments.  The first studies will use the crossed
              kilovolt ion beam/tunable laser method to measure high precision
              photodetachment cross sections near threshold in a static electric field.  Both
              I- and Bi- will be studied in electric fields up to several kV/cm to
              characterize rescattering effects in which the emerging electron's wavefunction
              is reflected by the electric field potential and scattered by the now neutral
              atomic core.   Subsequently, the faculty and student researchers will
              investigate static electric effects on the newly discovered unique excited
              states in Os-.  The second series of complementary experiments will proceed in
              parallel.  Using the Advanced Light Source (ALS) as a source of high energy
              photons, inner-shell photodetachment from C- and B- will be investigated.
