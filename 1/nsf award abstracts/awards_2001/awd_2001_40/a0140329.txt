Abstract    :
              Research is proposed on semiclassical methods for calculating the behavior of
              quantum systems whose classical counterparts are chaotic.  The primary focus is
              on the absorption spectrum of atoms in strong electric and magnetic fields.  In
              addition, new work will be started on systems having two active electrons
              undergoing breakup.
