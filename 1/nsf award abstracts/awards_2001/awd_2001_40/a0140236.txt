Abstract    :
              This project continues the development of an interface between 3D numerical
              simulations of colliding black holes and an approximate description of the
              merging black holes as a single distorted black hole (close limit
              approximation).  The successful development of the interface would allow the
              evolution of the black hole collision to continue through the plunge phase
              through the final ringdown phase.
The simulation of the two stages would allow
              estimates of the waveform and radiated angular momentum and energy to be made. 
              These estimates would represent a useful first step in producing information
              useful to gravitational wave detectors and could be used to cross-check similar
              studies using different 3D codes and interfaces.
