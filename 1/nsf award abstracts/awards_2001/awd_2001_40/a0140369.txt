Abstract    :
              This project takes advantage of the proximity of the ALLEGRO resonant bar
              gravitational wave detector at LSU to the LIGO Livingston Observatory to search
              for a stochastic background of gravitational radiation. The new ability of the
              ALLEGRO bar to rotate allows the introduction of a modulation to the signal by
              alternately aligning and mis-aligning the bar with the LIGO interferometer.
              This gives the signal a definite periodicity and distinguishes it from any
              correlated noise that does not have the expected quadrupolar spatial dependence
              of the gravitational radiation. Undergraduate students from Loyola University
              will participate in this project.

A stochastic background of gravitational
              radiation could be a relic of the early Universe, produced by inflation or a
              phase transition. The current limits on such a background are very loosely
              constrained. Thus any observation or upper limit placed on a stochastic
              background of gravitational waves could bring new information about the
              Universe.
