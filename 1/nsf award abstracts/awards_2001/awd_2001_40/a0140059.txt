Abstract    :
              The research proposed here seeks the answer to two fundamental questions about
              matter.  The first is what role does the sea of strange quark-antiquark pairs
              in the nucleon play in the determination of its electromagnetic properties?  We
              are participating in the G0 experiment at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator
              Facility to address this issue.  The experiment will measure the
              parity-violating asymmetry in the scattering of polarized electrons from the
              proton and deuteron over a wide range of momentum transfers;
this will allow
              for the strange electric and magnetic form factors to be separately extracted. 
              This experiment will be in a commissioning and data-taking phase during this
              grant period.  The second question is whether or not there is any new physics
              beyond the Standard Model of electroweak physics.  This question will be
              addressed by the QWEAK experiment at TJNAF, which will measure the proton's
              neutral weak charge via parity-violating electon scattering at very low
              momentum transfer.  This proton's weak charge has a well-defined prediction in
              the Standard Model; a precise measurement of it is sensitive to many poplular
              scenarios for extending the Standard Model.  This experiment will be in a
              construction phase during this grant period.
