Abstract    :
              This research seeks to construct the initial data for a pair of black
holes in
              an astrophysically realistic close binary system.  This data
represents the
              state of the binary system at an instant of time, and
is the necessary
              starting point for determining the evolution of the
system.  Two new
              approaches for constructing the initial data will be
explored.  Both
              approaches build into the data the idea that the
systems are nearly in
              equilibrium.  However, the two approaches differ
drastically in how the black
              holes themselves are treated.

The collision of a pair of orbiting black
              holes is a dramatic event
that we hope to detect soon in gravitational wave
              observatories such
as LIGO.  Simulations, starting from binary black hole
              initial data,
will provide the theoretical foundation for interpreting much of
              the
data obtained by LIGO.  The detection of black holes with LIGO will
offer
              the most direct evidence possible for their existence, and will
open up an
              exciting new window for exploring the universe.
