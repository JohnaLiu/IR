Abstract    :
              This project is for emergency funding to carry out additional interviews in the
              World Values Surveys (WVS) being carried out in Pakistan and Bangladesh.  These
              interviews use the version of the WVS interview schedule designed for Islamic
              societies, and adds supplementary questions to measure approval or disapproval
              of the recent terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C.   The
              investigation also assesses whether such attacks are seen as compatible with
              Islamic teachings.   The researchers also probe into support for democratic
              institutions and openness to ties with the West.

The existing WVS
              questionnaire explores the basic values and worldviews of each society without
              touching on current political issues.  Adding a battery of questions measuring
              attitudes toward terrorism and relations with the West makes it possible to
              analyze the extent to which these orientations are linked with enduring core
              elements of Islamic belief systems, and the extent to which they may be
              changing.  The pilot surveys conducted in Iran, Egypt and Jordan found
              surprisingly widespread support for democracy and indications of an
              intergenerational change in the direction of growing support for social and
              political liberalization.

This Small Grant for Exploratory Research
              investigation is extremely timely and will enhance substantially our
              understanding of this very important topic.
