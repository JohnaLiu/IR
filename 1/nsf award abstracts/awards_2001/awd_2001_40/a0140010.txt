Abstract    :
              Our proposed research program is directed towards developing a better
              understanding of the quark structure of protons, neutronsand light nuclei.
              Particular emphasis is placed on measurements of electromagnetic and weak
              properties of the nucleon using electron scattering at Jefferson Laboratory and
              MIT-Bates. Such data provide precise information about the spatial distribution
              of charge and magnetization in the nucleon. A major component of our program is
              the G0 experiment at Jefferson Laboratory, in which parity violation in
              polarized electron scattering from hydrogen and deuterium is used to identify
              the contribution of strange quark-antiquark pairs to  the proton's charge and
              magnetic moment. Coupled to this activity is the determination of "anapole"
              contributions to proton structure, which arise from parity-violating
              electromagnetic effects. Also proposed are studies of nucleon excitations using
              polarization measurements
of the recoiling nucleon, and the use of kaon
              electroproduction to create hypernuclei in which one nucleon in a nuclear
              system is replaced by a lambda particle.
