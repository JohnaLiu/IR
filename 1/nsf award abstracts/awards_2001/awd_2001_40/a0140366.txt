Abstract    :
              This proposal concentrates on the experiment E158 at the Stanford Linear
              Accelerator Center, which will determine the weak mixing angle (Weinberg angle)
              at low momentum transfer by measuring the
parity-violating asymmetry in Moller
              (electron-electron) scattering.  The experiment will provide the world's best
              low energy measurement of this fundamental parameter of the Standard Model of
              particle
interactions. By comparing the E158 results with the existing high
              energy measurements of the weak mixing angle, we will establish, for the first
              time, its momentum transfer dependence, predicted by the Standard Model.
              Deviations from the prediction would signal the presence of new phenomena
              beyond the Standard Model, including new neutral currents mediated by Z' bosons
              in the mass range of up to 900 GeV and new contact interactions with a scale of
              up to 11 TeV. This sensitivity matches or exceeds the direct and indirect
              search sensitivities of the high-energy collider experiments at CERN and
              FNAL.

Small asymmetries associated with measuring parity violating effects
              at low momentum transfer mount many challenges to the experimenters, in
              particular, in controlling systematics effects related to the
polarized
              electron beam. The UC Berkeley Nuclear Physics group brings an extensive
              experience in the beam instrumentation and data analysis to the E158
              experiment. We take major responsibilities in the running of the experiment,
              physics analysis, and possible upgrades.  While being at the forefront of the
              fundamental research, this project also provides unique opportunities for
              training and education of graduate and undergraduate students, giving them
              hands-on hardware experience as well as exposure to the modern
analysis
              techniques.
