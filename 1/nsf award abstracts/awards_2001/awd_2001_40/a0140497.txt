ABSTRACT


Quantum Unique
              Ergodicity and Rigidity in Dynamical Systems

The research proposed lies at
              the interface of dynamical 
systems and several other mathematical
              disciplines, and 
in particular number theory and the mathematical theory 
of
              Quantum Chaos. It is well known that the collections 
of invariant probability
              measures and closed invariant 
sets for hyperbolic maps or flows is very
              large; remarkably,
in many dynamical systems of algebraic origin where there
              
are two (or more) commuting hyperbolic maps or flows it is 
conjectured that
              there are actually very few measures or 
closed sets invariant under this
              bigger action. Despite (or 
perhaps because of) important contributions by
              several 
authors, the mystery of this rigidity property of 
multidimensional
              actions is still one of the central problems 
in modern ergodic theory.While
              seemingly unrelated, the 
methodology of the study of rigidity of
              multiparameter actions 
is very suitable to study the arithmetical case of the
              Quantum 
Unique Ergodicity Conjecture, regarding the limit of the 
spatial
              distribution of a free particle on certain manifolds 
in a quantum steady
              state as the energy of the state tends to
infinity (the semiclassical limit). 
              This question has been 
considered previously by many authors mostly using
              tools from 
analytic number theory; the approach proposed, using the
              
dynamical approach, is new and has already borne fruits.

The theory of
              dynamical systems gives tools to study complex 
systems, for example the
              evolution of a complicated deterministic
process over time. There is a rich
              and distinguished tradition 
of using these powerful tools in other
              mathematical disciplines, 
most notably in number theory and combinatorics.
              The research 
proposed is connected to several of the most exciting possible
              
applications, including new implications to the theory of 
quantum chaos in
              mathematical physics.
