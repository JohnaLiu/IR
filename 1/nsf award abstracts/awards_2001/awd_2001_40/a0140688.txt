Abstract    :
              This proposal is from the University of Utah group and requests funding to
              continue to operate the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) Observatory, located
              at the U.S. Army's Dugway Proving Ground, Utah.  The HiRes observatory consists
              of two stations separated by 12.6 km and detects ultra high energy (UHE) cosmic
              rays via nitrogen fluorescence in the atmosphere. The goals of the experiment
              are to study the spectrum, composition and anisotropy of cosmic rays with
              energies starting from about 1017 eV up to beyond 1020 eV.  Previous
              experiments, including the original Fly's Eye experiment, have shown evidence
              that the spectrum may continue past the predicted Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK)
              cutoff and the nature of the events above the GZK cutoff is a puzzle. The goal
              of the HiRes experiment is to achieve an order of magnitude greater sensitivity
              than the previous Fly's Eye experiment.  In earlier running of HiRes, a few
              outstanding events have been observed above 1020 eV, but the flux of these
              events is in significant disagreement with the published results from the AGASA
              ground array.  This proposal requests funds to continue running in order to
              resolve this and other outstanding issues of UHE cosmic rays by measuring the
              properties of events with energies above 1017 eV.  

In addition, HiRes has a
              vigorous educational outreach program, ASPIRE, funded by the NSF and conducted
              in collaboration with the Utah State Office of Education. The goal of this
              program is to communicate the excitement of the scientific research to the
              general public.

The HiRes experiment is a collaborative effort between the
              University of Utah, the University of Adelaide, Columbia University, Rutgers
              University, Montana State University, the University of New Mexico, and the
              University of Tokyo.
