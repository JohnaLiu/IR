Abstract    :
              The physics activities of the Northeastern University group in the recent past
              have concentrated on electroweak physics with complementary analyses taking
              place at several detectors at the energy frontier.  The group plans to continue
              to work within this framework in the proposed grant period, taking advantage of
              the new data to come from Run 2 with the upgraded Fermilab detector D0.  The
              group also plans to continue high sensitivity searches for processes which are
              either rare or forbidden in the Standard Model. Hardware and software
              activities are also concentrated in areas in which the group has longstanding
              expertise.

Interdisciplinary and outreach activities, including Quarknet and
              a CERN RET site, have been very successful.
