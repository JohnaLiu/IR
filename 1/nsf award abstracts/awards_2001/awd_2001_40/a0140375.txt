Abstract    :
              This award is for continuing support of a program of fundamental investigations
              of physical phenomena important to understanding x-ray interactions with atoms
              and molecules. The primary scientific focus is probing the limits, especially
              at low photon energies, of the dipole approximation, the simplest reasonable
              treatment of photon interactions. Although well-known breakdowns of the dipole
              approximation exist (e.g., the dipole approximation is known to be completely
              invalid at photon energies greater than 20 keV), recent work of this program
              has demonstrated quantitatively significant breakdowns at surprisingly low
              energies and in unexpected ways; further studies may well lead to changes in
              some of the foundations of x-ray spectroscopy. The work proposed not only will
              further understanding of fundamental x-ray interactions, but determining the
              limits of the dipole approximation is important to myriad applications of x-ray
              absorption, x-ray photoemission, and x-ray fluorescence to other fields because
              these applications routinely assume the dipole approximation. In addition to
              the focus on nondipole effects in x-ray photoemission and x-ray fluorescence,
              related work is proposed on multi-atom resonance effects, transient species,
              and probing the limits of the independent-particle approximation.
