Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the high-precision measurement of both the nuclear
              spin-independent and the nuclear spin-dependent parity-nonconserving (PNC)
              effects in atomic ytterbium (Yb).  While based on proven experimental
              techniques, these measurements represent a radically different approach
              compared to earlier work in that they use an atom with an unusually large PNC
              effect and do not rely on highly accurate atomic calculations. The nuclear
              spin-independent effect will have a significant impact on our understanding of
              the semi-leptonic electroweak interactions, while the nuclear spin-dependent
              effect will provide important information concerning the hadronic electroweak
              interactions within the nucleus.
