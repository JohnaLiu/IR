Abstract    :
              This project is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of investment casting
              with ice patterns generated by Rapid Freeze Prototyping, a novel solid freeform
              fabrication process which builds a three-dimensional part according to a CAD
              model by depositing and freezing water droplets layer by layer. The feasibility
              study includes: exploring ways of handling and transporting ice patterns
              between stations for the subsequent investing casting process; identifying
              suitable materials including powders and binders for making ceramic shells from
              ice patterns; studying limitations on feature shapes and sizes of ice patterns
              for investment casting and ability to retain sharp features of ice patterns
              over time; and investigating the dimensional accuracy and surface finish of the
              metal castings obtained from ice patterns. 

If the project is successful, it
              will likely create a significant new approach for rapid prototyping and
              small-quantity manufacturing of investment casting parts with ice patterns
              fabricated by a cost-effective and environmentally benign method. This could
              significantly improve the environmental impact of processing molds in the
              investment casting industry.
