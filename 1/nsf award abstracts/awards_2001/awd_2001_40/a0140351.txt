Abstract    :
              This project is a continuation of work in progress to measure, using laser
              spectroscopy, magnetic dipole transition wavelengths within the ground terms of
              selected multiply-charged ions. The basic goals of the research are
              determination of the g-factor of an electron in a bound state of a highly
              charged ion, and precision laser measurement of the hyperfine structure of a
              high-Z one-electron ion. Immediate goals are fine-structure measurements on
              intermediate-Z ions, using a laser beam to induce the transitions in ions
              condensed to an ordered state at low temperature in a Penning ion trap.  The
              research is done in collaboration with scientists from the Lawrence Berkeley
              National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 
              Theoretical support is provided through a collaboration with an atomic
              structure theorist at the University of Texas, Pan American, an undergraduate
              institution.
