Abstract    :
              This effort is the beginning of a multi-step project that has the long-term goal
              of demonstrating the existence of an annihilation photon laser based on
              annihilation radiation from positronium in a dense gas.  The specific goals of
              the first three years are: 1) Compress a cold, spin-aligned, non-neutral plasma
              of positrons trapped in a magnetic field to near the Brillouin limit. Extract
              the positrons and focus them to a microscopic spot on a sample in a short time
              pulse; 2) Demonstrate the existence of a high positron surface density by
              forming and observing the di-positronium molecule, Ps2. The density dependence
              of the Ps2 yield may be interpreted to give the binding energy of Ps2 relative
              to two free Ps atoms and the accommodation or sticking coefficient SPs2 for Ps2
              absorption at the surface; and 3) Form a gas of high-density triplet Ps within
              a cavity.  The research efforts will be accompanied by an educational effort in
              which undergraduate students will be involved in part time work creating
              demonstration experiments suitable for encouraging high school students to work
              in scientific fields and creating a high school level interactive internet web
              site on "Antimatter" to eventually permit remote real time participation in
              demonstration experiments.
