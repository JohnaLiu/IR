Abstract    :
              The MIT group will build a novel atom interferometer with which to measure the
              fine structure constant at the ppb level. This will be used to measure h/m,
              which will be combined with the group's recent atomic mass measurements to
              determine the molar Planck constant. This can be combined with other recent
              measurements to yield a measurement of the fine structure constant. The new
              interferometer uses Bose-Einstein condensates in a contrast interferometer -
              one in which the contrast of the fringes rather than their position oscillates
              when the phase being measured increases. This interferometer, a prototype of
              which was recently demonstrated, contains the following three major advances,
              any one of which would have substantially improved previous h/m experiments.
              Since the atoms are all in the same state, first-order AC Stark shifts are
              eliminated, the interferometer is insensitive to vibration, and an accurate
              phase measurement can be made in a single "shot" of the interferometer. The
              interferometer has the additional feature that the phase increases
              quadratically with the order of the beamsplitters. This will be exploited to
              make measurements to 1ppb in a single shot. The "next generation
              interferometer" will feature magnetic shielding and high optical quality
              viewports to reduce other systematic errors such as inhomogeneous magnetic
              fields and optical wavefront distortions.
