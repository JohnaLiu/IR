Abstract    :
              Hyperspherical methods are applied to the 1)interaction of atoms in clusters and
              Bose condensates, and 2) the interaction of electrons and positrons with
              matter.  In 1) three body effects are treated using a combination of
              multi-channel quantum defect theory (MCQDT) and the adiabatic, hyperspherical
              representation.  The method incorporates Feshbach resonances  in a natural way
              and enables a realistic analysis of the effect of the resonances on three-body
              recombination.  In 2) the hyperspherical hidden crossing method, again coupled
              with MCQDT is used to examine positron-atom interactions.
