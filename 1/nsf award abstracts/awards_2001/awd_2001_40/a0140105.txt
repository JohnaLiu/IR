Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a group at Michigan State University for a
              program of research and education in experimental elementary particle physics
              based on the CDF experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton collider
              and on the ATLAS experiment at the proton-proton Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at
              Cern, Geneva. 

The MSU group has been a member of the CDF experiment since
              1992. The group has major responsibilities to the Run II upgrades for the new
              plug calorimeters, to the new central tracker, to the muon system upgrade and
              to a new central pre-radiator detector. They are actively engaged in the
              analyses of QCD physics. The group's work on ATLAS 
involves the construction
              and testing of the hadron calorimeter subsystem, involving scintillator tiles
              and optical fibers.

Members of the MSU group are involving undergraduates
              and high school teachers and students in their research activities. The group
              is a member of QuarkNet, the multi-institutional effort to involve high school
              teachers and their students in particle physics research.
