Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on the
              phenomenology of noncommutative spacetime, the physics of extra spatial
              dimensions, including higher-dimensional theories of particle masses, and
              six-quark cluster models of the deuteron.

The first two topics deal with the
              possibility that the structure of spacetime itself may be altered at distance
              scales just beneath those currently accessible in experiments.  This leads to
              novel particle physics signatures and provides a new framework for
              understanding the mysterious pattern of elementary particle masses.  The third
              topic deals with a model for the short-distance  structure of the deuteron (the
              nucleus of an isotope of hydrogen) that may lead to a better understanding of
              the dynamics of the strong nuclear force.
