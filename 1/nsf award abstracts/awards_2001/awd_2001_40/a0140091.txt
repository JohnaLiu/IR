Abstract    :
              Previous investigation into the dynamics of a gaseous Bose-Einstein condensate
              has revealed a number of interesting phenomena such as solitons and vortices. 
              The current research is designed to examine the validity of the mean-field
              approximation previously employed by including correlation effects using a
              multi-configurational approach well known in quantum chemistry.  The new method
              will be applied to condensates in optical lattices where transitions from
              delocalized to localized states are known to occur.
