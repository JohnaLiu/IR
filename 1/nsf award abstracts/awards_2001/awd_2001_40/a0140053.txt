Abstract    :
              This proposal describes a novel research program on nonlinear and adaptive
              attitude control of complex rotating mechanical systems.  The special feature
              of the research program is that it is framed in terms of control experiments
              that can be carried out in unique laboratory facilities at the University of
              Michigan.  Control experiments will be integrated with and guided by recent
              advances in nonlinear and adaptive control theory.  Research on adaptive and
              nonlinear control theory will be motivated by the experimental results.  The
              research is expected to advance the state of the art in adaptive and nonlinear
              control, especially as applied to control of complex rotating mechanical
              systems.
