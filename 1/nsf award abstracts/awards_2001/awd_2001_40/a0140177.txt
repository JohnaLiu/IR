The proposes a two-fold research plan for the purpose of
              producing the first generation of self-biased ferrite circulator devices. In
              the first research plan he develops techniques to prepare composite
              ferrite/dielectric materials consisting of dielectric paste filling material
              and oriented hexaferrite particles. In the second phase of the research plan,
              he will utilize the special properties of the composites to design and test
              circulation devices from 1 to 20 GHz. He anticipates that the performance of
              the self-biased circulators to behave similarly to circulators using spinel and
              garnet ferrites in terms of frequency bandwidth of operation, insertion loss
              and isolation. Whereas the traditional circulator devices is characterized by
              the so-called "puck" design, his design will integrate the circulator devices
              into a semiconductor/dielectric substrate utilizing the well known thick film
              glass on screen print technolagies. In addition, the self-biased hexaferrite
              circulators proposed here will do away with permanent magnets which in most
              cases occupy considerable space in a microwave circuit board. Reduction in
              circulator size translates into reduction of fabrication costs and increased
              efficiency in the performance of the overall microwave circuit board. The
              research program comprises of preparation of composites of hexaferrites and
              dielectric paste on glass, characterization of the oriented ferrite composite
              materials, fabrication of stripline/microstrip circulators, testing of the
              circulators and modeling of the microwave and static properties of the
              composite materials.
