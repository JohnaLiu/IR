The main aim of the research is to investigate
              nuclear-hadronic
dynamics with a particular emphasis on its relation to
              quantum
chromodynamics (QCD), the fundamental dynamics of quarks and gluons.
              We
are particularly interested in the role of chiral symmetry, which is
              one
of the basic symmetries of QCD. 

Chiral perturbation theory offers a
              systematic and practical framework
to translate the symmetries of QCD into
              those of hadrons, particles that
actually constitute nuclei.  Our research
              makes extensive use
of this formalism.  At the same time, for those phenomena
              which are at
present beyond the applicability of chiral perturbation theory,
              we
resort to models that preserve chiral symmetry and that can be applied
to
              complex nuclei. Specifically, we study: 
(1) Consequences of nuclear chiral
              perturbation theory as applied to
few-nucleon systems; 
(2) Muon capture on
              light nuclei and its relation to neutrino
interactions with light nuclei;
              
(3) Radiative corrections for the neutrino-deuteron cross
              sections,
corrections that will be of importance for next-generation
              high
precision solar neutrino data to be obtained at the Sudbury
              Neutrino
Observatory; 
(4) Comparison of the sigma model and chiral
              perturbation theory; and 
(5) Strangeness condensation in dense matter.
