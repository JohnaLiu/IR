Abstract    :
              A broad program of research in the theory of elementary particles and
              quantum
field theory will include investigation of composite models of
              particles thought to be
elementary up to now using the existence of extra
              space dimensions. The relation
of violations of CPT symmetry, where C is
              charge conjugation or matter-antimatter
exchange, P is parity or space
              inversion, and T is time reversal, to violations of
Lorentz invariance (i.e.,
              of the theory of relativity) will be investigated. The nature
of elementary
              particle statistics will be explored. These investigations are central to
the
              understanding of the properties and interactions of elementary particles.
