Abstract    :
              The research of Imamoglu focuses on the analytic theory of L-series 
of several
              complex variables. The PI and her collaborators have 
recently defined  
              Rankin-Selberg Dirichlet series of several complex 
variables attached to
              Siegel cusp forms. She proposes to exploit the 
analytic properties of these
              series to establish non-vanishing 
results for special values of
              Rankin-Selberg convolutions of 
Fourier_Jacobi coefficients of Siegel forms
              and to improve bounds for 
their classical Fourier coefficients. She also
              proposes to investigate 
a possible generalization of the classical Dedekind
              zeta function of 
a number field to a zeta function of several complex
              variables.

The investigations of this proposal belong to number theory,
              which is 
a branch of mathematics that deals with problems involving whole
              
numbers. Mathematicians have discovered that many of the important
              
properties of whole numbers can be encoded into certain objects 
called
              "L-functions". These L-functions have their origin in the 
study of calculus
              but our understanding of their fundamental 
properties are far from complete.
              The PI and her collaborators 
proposes to investigate the analytic properties
              of these functions to 
fill in some of the gaps in our knowledge.
