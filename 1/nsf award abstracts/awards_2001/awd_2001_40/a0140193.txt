ABSTRACT

The method of
              Bellman functions is a powerful method that
can be used to bound sums indexed
              by dyadic intervals.
Many discrete results in Harmonic Analysis have
              been
obtained with this method in the last few years. To date
it can be used
              on sums involving inner products of a
function with the scaling or wavelet
              functions from the
Haar wavelet system, but not the scaling or
              wavelet
functions of general wavelet systems. Many of the discrete
results
              obtained with the current Bellman function method
could be expanded to the
              continuous setting if the Bellman
function method was available for more
              general wavelets.
The PI proposes to expand the method of Bellman
              functions
from its current scope to sums involving any MRA
              wavelet.

Wavelets have been useful in many areas such as
mathematics,
              physics, engineering and signal processing.
They are the basis of the new
              world wide web image
compression standard JPEG2000. They prove to also be
              a
useful tool in harmonic analysis. It is frequently
necessary to estimate
              the size of sums involving wavelets.
The Bellman function method is a very
              useful tool in doing
so, but currently only works for a very special
              wavelet
called the Haar wavelet. The PI is interested in
generalizing the
              method where possible to more general
classes of wavelets.
