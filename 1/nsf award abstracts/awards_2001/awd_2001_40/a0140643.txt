Abstract    :
              Although building codes and practices in the United States and Japan have been
              developed to the point where they provide a large measure of protection of life
              safety, the recent 1994 Northridge and 1995 Kobe earthquake have demonstrated
              that near-field ground motions present severe challenges even to structures
              designed according to current codes.  While the response spectrum provides the
              basis for the specification of design ground motions in all current design
              guidelines and code provisions, there is a growing recognition that the
              response spectrum alone does not provide an adequate characterization of
              near-fault ground motions.  This indicates the importance of developing an
              improved representation of near-fault ground motions using time domain
              parameters such as the amplitude, period and number of cycles of the near fault
              pulse, and its energy characteristics, in addition to the response spectrum,
              for use in analysis and design of structures.  The objectives of this project
              is to develop methods for characterizing near-fault ground motion for use in
              engineering design and evaluation.  The project will be done in collaboration
              with Professor Iwata of Kyoto University, and colleagues from several other
              Japanese research organizations, with whom the Principal Investigators have a
              long term collaborative relationship.
