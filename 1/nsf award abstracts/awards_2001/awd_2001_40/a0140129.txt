Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include studies
of
              supersymmetry and other new theories of fundamental particle
interactions.
              Supersymmetry is a promising idea which predicts the
existence of many new
              heavy subatomic particles. The properties of these
particles, including their
              masses and the rates at which they decay into
other particles, will be studied
              under a variety of different theoretical
assumptions.

  The resulting
              predictions are important because they will affect both
the planning and the
              analysis of many present and future experiments that
search for new particles.
              These studies are of central importance for
understanding the behavior of
              particle physics involving interactions at
very high energies. They will also
              impact on our understanding of the
physics of the very early universe, when
              the particles under consideration
would have been plentiful.
