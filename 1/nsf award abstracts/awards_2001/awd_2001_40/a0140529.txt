Particulate contamination of silicon wafers after
              chemical mechanical polishing processes is a major problem that affects yield
              in semiconductor manufacturing. The removal and adhesion forces of slurry
              particles are greatly affected by the polishing, cleaning, rinsing and drying
              processes that follow the particle initial contact with the surface. In this
              proposed international collaboration between Hanyang University and
              Northeastern University, the interaction between slurry particles and wafer
              surfaces will be investigated by electrical characterization of the particles
              and wafer substrates and by measuring the removal and the adhesion forces of
              these particles. The goal of the project is to understand particle adhesion and
              removal mechanisms for submicron particles. Hydrodynamic removal forces and the
              effect of the zeta potential on slurry particle adhesion and removal will be
              investigated. The study will also determine the effectiveness of the cleaning
              techniques for each particle/film systems.
