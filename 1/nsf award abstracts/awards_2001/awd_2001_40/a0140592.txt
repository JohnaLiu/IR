Abstract

Professor Simon will continue his
              research focusing on direct and inverse
spectral problems for Schrodinger
              operators and their discrete analogs.  He
plans to explore the impact of sum
              rules for spectral theory both for Jacobi
matrices (where he and Killip
              recently solved several long open conjectures
from the Orthogonal Polynomial
              community using sum rules) and Schrodinger
operators.  Other problems he
              expects to look at include the structure of
the isospectral manifold for
              problems with discrete spectrum, resonance
counting in higher dimensions, and
              the study of mixed singular continuous
and point spectrum.

A fundamental
              problem in wide swaths of science is determining the relation
between some
              object that can only be observed indirectly and the information
you can
              observe indirectly.  There are two sides of issue: determine what
is
              indirectly observed for a given state of the system, called the
              direct
problem, and trying to induce properties of the system from the
              indirect
observations, called the inverse problem.  Professor Simon will
              study
various aspects of direct and inverse problems in quantum mechanics. 
              While
the focus will be on the equations of quantum theory, there are
              potential
spinoffs to tomography and radar/sonar direct and inverse
              problems.
