Abstract    :
              Buechler's proposed research is to extend the scope of
geometrical stability
              theory outside of the context of a
first-order theory.  His test project is an
              analysis of the
geometries induced by bounded linear operators on a Hilbert
              space
and more complex structures like von Neumann algebras. With his
student
              Berenstein Buechler has shown that many self-adjoint
operators induce
              dependence relations satisfying all of the
conditions of the dividing
              dependence relation. Buechler hopes
that the dividing dependence relation will
              give insight into the
structure of von Neumann algebras. In another project
              Buechler
will investigate "dividing relative to a closure operator".
              While
this study is analogous to the study of p-simple types in a
superstable
              theory it presents dramatically different results
when the original theory is
              not simple and the closure operator
is chosen creatively. Applications to
              metric spaces and Vaught's
conjecture are expected. Buechler will also study a
              class of
scale-free networks with model-theoretic methods.
              Scale-free
networks are ubiquitous in nature and technology.  Random
              graph
theorists have discovered some of their properties, such as the
degree
              functions.  However, techniques for building models are
limited.  Model
              theorists have developed techniques for building
graphs that are random
              relative to some constraints.  These
methods may lend themselves to building
              scale-free graphs with
specified parameters.

Frequently a significant
              advancement in science occurs when a
problem arising in one area is viewed
              from the perspective of
another discipline.  For example, problems in genetics
              have
yielded to techniques from graph theory. In mathematics algebra
has lead
              to great insight into geometry and knot theory.
Buechler's specialty is model
              theory, a subfield of mathematical
logic. Recently, Hrushovski applied model
              theory to solve
problems in number theory. Buechler is adapting these
              same
model-theoretic methods with an eye to problems in analysis and
network
              theory. In analysis Buechler is looking at the
model-theoretic content of
              operator theory, which has connections
to mathematical physics.  The networks
              Buechler will study are at
the heart of such disparate systems as the
              metabolic pathways in
a cell and the World Wide Web. Buechler will attempt to
              adapt
model-theoretic techniques for constructing graphs of interest in
pure
              mathematics to building models of these networks arising in
nature and
              technology.  Graduate students will be involved in all
of these projects. The
              cross-disciplinary nature of the work will
require the students to learn
              science that their normal
curriculum would not expose them to, and to learn
              the value of
viewing research in a broader context.
