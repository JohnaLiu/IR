Abstract    :
              Recognizing an opportunity to address new physics, a strong collaboration
              representing 20 institutions, has formed and is proposing funding for the
              project entitled "Rare Symmetry Violating Processes" (RSVP). RSVP represents an
              opportunity to empower the university community to make discoveries of
              extraordinary importance. The current scope of RSVP includes 130 scientists,
              about 60% from the United States, and the others from Canada, Switzerland,
              Italy, Japan, and Russia, along with an expected 100 graduate students and
              post-docs.

KOPIO, a component of the RSVP project, is an experiment to
              measure the branching ratio of the decay of a neutral K meson into a neutral
              pion, a neutrino, and an anti-neutrino. The interest in this decay mode is that
              it yields the single, most incisive determination of the parameter describing
              CP (or time reversal symmetry) violation involving quarks.  This in turn will
              shed light on the reason that our Universe is populated with matter, rather
              than equal amounts of matter and anti-matter as expected from the naive Big
              Bang theory of the origin of the Universe.  This matter anti-matter asymmetry,
              a critical factor in our origins, is one of the fundamental issues in particle
              physics today.
