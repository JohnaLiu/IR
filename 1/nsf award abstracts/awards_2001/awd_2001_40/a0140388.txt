This award, provided by the Antarctic Geology and
              Geophysics Program of the Office of Polar Programs, supports student
              participation in the 65th Annual Meeting of the Meteoritical Society which will
              be held on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), from
              July 22-26, 2002. The principal scientific focus of this international meeting
              is deciphering the clues to the origin and evolution of the solar system that
              are contained within the chemical, petrologic, and isotopic properties of
              meteorites. Meteorites made available to researchers through the US Antarctic
              meteorite program sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the National
              Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Smithsonian Institution
              are an important aspect of international meteoritical research. This award will
              provide travel support to enable students to participate in the meeting. The
              student travel awards will be made on a competitive basis and will support
              primarily U.S. and also some foreign students. Additional financial support for
              the meeting is anticipated from NASA, The Barringer Foundation, and a number of
              scientific instrument manufacturers (JEOL USA, Inc., Cameca, Inc., Finnigan,
              Inc., and Micromass, Inc.). This award will provide a scientifically enriching
              experience to the student recipients of the travel support
