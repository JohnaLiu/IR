Abstract    :
              
The proposal deals with several topics in low-dimensional
dynamics. The PI
              plans to investigate the topological dynamics
of laminations; in particular he
              would like to further develop
the dynamics of growing trees and use it to
              study the behavior
of the vertices of the Julia set. He also wants to consider
              
classes of non-analytic plane maps for whom analogs of well-known
results
              for polynomials can be proven. Other directions of his
research are related to
              attractos for classes of rational maps 
and to further developing the rotation
              theory which studies 
coexistence of cycles depending on their characteristics
              similar
to rotation numbers for circle maps of degree one. 

The theory of
              dynamical systems gives tools to study complex 
systems, for example the
              evolution of a complicated deterministic
process over time. There is a rich
              and distinguished tradition 
of using these powerful tools in  other sciences 
              like 
communication theory, statistical physics, and chemical kinetics.
