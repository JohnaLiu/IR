Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, a
              non-profit organization, has been instrumental in improving the education of
              under-represented groups that have been historically undeserved by the nation's
              educational system.  A successor to the Quality Education for Minorities
              Project based at MIT, QEM continues to develop effective strategies for STEM
              education for minorities, and focuses on issues and barriers that prevent
              minorities from receiving a high quality education. This project continues to
              provide internship opportunities for students at the National Science
              Foundation as a mechanism to increase students understanding of science policy;
              encourage potential for becoming leaders and proponents for increased STEM
              participation by students from low-income communities; and encourage interns to
              continue STEM interests and studies through the doctoral level. Complimentary
              to the internship experience at NSF, students are required to engage in a
              science-oriented community outreach activity during the following academic year
              at their respective institutions.
