Abstract    :
              The primary aim of the project is to explore connections between theories
              describing two different fundamental forces, namely, the nuclear force and
              gravity.   The strong and weak nuclear forces are described by gauge theories,
              whereas quantum gravity is thought to be described by string theory.  String
              theory, however, contains not only strings but also D-branes, extended objects
              whose properties involve supersymmetric gauge theories, thus providing the
              connection between the two types of theory.   Specifically, the project focuses
              on the properties of particular string theories containing D-branes and
              orientifold planes;  in these theories, the supersymmetric gauge theories
              describing the D-branes include the analogs of quarks.

The interest of this
              line of research is that questions impossible to answer in one theory may be
              easy to answer using the other theory, and vice versa, allowing progress to be
              made in both.   For example, well-understood properties of gauge theory could
              lead to a better understanding of string theory, and thus quantum gravity,
              which has long been an unsolved problem.   Conversely, string theory could be
              used to probe gauge theories in the poorly understood strong-coupling regime. 
              Ultimately, this could explain the phenomenon of quark confinement (that is,
              the fact that free quarks cannot be observed) and yield a quantitative
              understanding of the structure of protons, nuclei, etc., in terms of the
              properties of their constituent quarks.
