	The
              project will collect the first wave of narrative oral histories from six
              samples of New York residents with varying degrees of contact with the World
              Trade Center.  These oral histories are planned as the first wave of what would
              be three waves of interviews that would track how individuals' narrative
              accounts of those events are shaped over time by public narratives and come to
              conform to a standard narrative account.  The project will also analyze
              differences in these narrative accounts across the six New York samples,
              comparing for instance, the stories from people who lost family members,
              stories from surviving rescue workers, and stories from the general population
              less directly involved in the World Trade Center events.  The use of oral
              histories will provide broad textual sources that reveal not only what people
              know but how people (and society) construct narratives and create meanings for
              critical events such as September 11.  Network and sequence analysis methods
              will be used to explore the structure of how the textual elements are put
              together into a coherent narrative, and how that structure changes over time
              and differs among groups.
