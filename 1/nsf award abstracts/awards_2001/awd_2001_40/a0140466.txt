Abstract    :
              This grant provides funds for the development of a processing tool, as well as a
              processing planning system, for the rapid deposition of concentrated colloidal
              gels. This is a solid freeform fabrication technology and the current grant is
              focused at performing deposition based fabrication on length scales the order
              of microns. The tool to be developed is a robotic system consisting of dual
              stage serving axes in 3 dimensions. A coarse stage driven by linear motors will
              carry a fine stage driven by piezos which will actually support the deposition
              head. Process modeling will be performed to determine material flow behavior
              and solidification characteristics. These models will then be used in a process
              planning CAE tool to determine optimal machine processing conditions. The
              overall project will fuse together expertise from the fields of Robotics,
              Controls, Manufacturing, and Materials Science to create very small scale
              periodic structures in an extremely rapid fashion.

If successful, this work
              will enable the creation of microscale periodic lattices. By developing
              intentional defects in the structures, these lattices can then be used to
              provide optical waveguide capability for advanced photonic devices. The benefit
              of the proposed method is the time taken to construct such devices. While
              standard lithography methods can achieve the same resolution, the time for
              processing is on the order of days. The current system will have build times on
              the order of minutes. This will allow for the exploration of a huge design
              space in creating photonic bandgap structures that could be the future backbone
              of computing and communication applications.
