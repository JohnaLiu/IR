Abstract    :
              Scientists love a mystery, because solving a mystery in nature means the
              opportunity to learn something new about the universe. High-energy cosmic rays
              are just such a mystery. Something out there -- no one knows what -- is hurling
              incredibly energetic particles around the universe. Do these particles come
              from some unknown superpowerful cosmic explosion? From a huge black hole
              sucking stars to their violent deaths? From colliding galaxies? From the
              collapse of massive invisible relics from the origin of the universe? We don't
              yet know the answers, but we do know that solving this mystery will take
              scientists another step forward in understanding the universe. This group from
              Northeastern University wants to be a part of the team that solves this
              mystery.
