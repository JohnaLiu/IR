During the initial stage of relativistic nuclear collisions,
              enormous amount
of energy is deposited in the collision region and the
              temperature and
density can be high enough that individual hadrons lose their
              identities.
Instead of being confined in hadrons, quarks and gluons can now
              move
"freely" in this collision region. The matter thus produced is called
              the
Quark-Gluon Plasma. The transition between hadronic matter and
              the
Quark-Gluon Plasma gives us insight into the interactions between quarks
              and
gluons under extreme conditions. It is also useful for the understanding
              of
processes going on in other high temperature and/or high density
              regions,
for example, in the early Universe and in the cores of neutron stars.
              To
extract information about the Quark-Gluon Plasma from the
              experimental
observables, to bridge the initial quark and gluon distributions
              and the
final hadron distributions, the PI will investigate the effects of
              the
space-time evolution of the strongly interacting matter produced
              in
relativistic collisions. In particular, a transport model approach will
              be
further developed and used as the major theoretical tool for a
              detailed
study of the transient formation and evolution of the finite
              size,
ultradense system produced in relativistic nuclear collisions
              with
nonequilibrium, viscous effects automatically taken into account.
              The
research will advance the understanding of strong interaction physics
              that
is the focus of current experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
              Collider
at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the nuclear physics program at
              the
future Large Hadron Collider at CERN.
