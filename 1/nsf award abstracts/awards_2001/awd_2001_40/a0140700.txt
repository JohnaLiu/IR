Abstract    :
              Joint Performance Optimization of Wireless Networks and Control
              Systems


Current control technology is not well suited
to operation over a
              packet based network, and conversely,
most networks are not optimized for
              control applications.  
Moreover, critical network performance parameters that
              affect control
system performance, such as bit rates
and delay and packet
              loss statistics, depend on various
choices made in the network, such as powers
              allocated to wireless
transmitters, bandwidths or time-slot fractions
              allocated to 
channels, and routing methods.
So in addition to the challenge
              of working out how a control
system can be made to work in a packet-based
              
networked environment, we also
have the challenge of working out how the
              network should be 
configured, or operated, so as to improve control system
              performance.
This proposal addresses two fundamental issues that
              arise.
Neither solves the whole problem, but each addresses a critical
              issue.

The first topic involves joint optimization of
a controller and
              critical communication and network
parameters such as transmit powers, packet
              routing, and
bandwidth and time-slot allocation. 
To simplify this problem,
              only the affects of these
network parameters on bit rates, hence quantization
              noise, is 
considered.  The second topic considered is
simultaneous routing
              and resource allocation for wireless
data networks.
This is the problem of
              jointly finding an optimal set
of flows and communication resources that
              maximize the performance of
the network, with respect to some objective such
              as optimal
control system performance.
Here we hope to develop algorithms to
              dynamically allocate
communication resources (such as transmit powers,
              bandwidth)
and simultaneously optimize routing decisions.
