This award supports U.S. participants in the Conference on Progress
              in Partial Differential Equations and Applications held at Washington State
              University on May 15-18, 2002.  The workshop emphasizes recent progress in
              nonlinear partial differential equations arising from applied sciences and
              industrial applications. The focus is mainly on three topics: control and
              inverse problems, free boundary problems, and numerical analysis. One of the
              days of the workshop features the Pacific Northwest Partial Differential
              Equations seminar series.

This workshop will help researchers develop new
              tools to tackle nonlinear problems in their own research fields. It will
              provide an excellent opportunity for communication and collaboration among
              faculty and between senior and junior investigators. It will motivate young
              researchers and graduate students to learn the latest developments in the field
              of partial differential equations and applications. It will also facilitate
              collaboration between mathematicians and researchers from other physical
              sciences and engineering fields.
