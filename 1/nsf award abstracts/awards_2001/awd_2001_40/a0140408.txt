Complex Dynamics in Higher Dimension
Proposal Abstract

The
              principal investigator proposes to study the dynamics of meromorphic
self-maps
              of compact complex manifolds.  If such a map expands some
cohomology class of
              the manifold, then the main idea is that there ought
to be a distinguished
              invariant current representing this class.
Intersections between  invariant
              currents should in turn give rise to
invariant measures that describe the
              distribution of orbits where the
action of the map is most complicated.  Hence
              the linear action of a
meromorphic map on cohomology should go a long way
              toward determining a
probabilistic picture of the pointwise dynamics of the
              map.  To justify 
these ideas, the investigator proposes to use a combination
              of techniques
from complex geometry, smooth ergodic theory, and
              pluripotential
analysis.  Various problems in physics and mathematics reduce
              to questions
about the dynamics of particular meromorphic maps.  The
              investigator
proposes to use some of these as starting points and test cases
              for his
research.

The study of dynamical systems has grown increasingly
              important in the
past several decades.  Put briefly, a dynamical system is
              anything--e.g. 
the weather, the stock-market, the solar system, etc--that
              evolves in
time according (at least theoretically) to definite and codifiable
              rules.
The general goal in studying a dynamical system is to make
              predictions
about its future state given its present one.  If the future is
              very
far off then this, as any honest forecaster will admit, is typically
              quite 
difficult.  Small changes in the present state of the system can imply
              
huge differences in eventual outcome.  The research proposed here is
devoted
              to better understanding instability in dynamical systems--when
it occurs, why
              it occurs, and how to recognize it.  The research is also
devoted to attaining
              partial control over instability by making
statistical predictions about the
              eventual behavior of an unstable system
that do not depend on perfect
              understanding of its present state.  The
dynamical systems that the
              investigator proposes to study are mathematical
in nature, but they are also
              archtypes for the systems that one analyzes
in connection with real-world
              phenomena.  The idea is that weather and
the stockmarket and the solar system
              ought not be treated as a separate
and totally unrelated dynamical systems but
              as particular examples
of the same general phenomena and subject to similar
              kinds of analyses.
