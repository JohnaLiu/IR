Abstract    :
              In this project laser light forces will be used to directly focus gallium and
              indium atoms during the molecular beam epitaxy of III-V heterostructures.  The
              ability to focus the Group III atoms is particularly interesting because they
              are the key building blocks of modern III-V semiconductor lasers.  The optical
              method will provide unprecedented control in the location and size of the
              nanostructures.  Thus, the work has the potential of revolutionizing
              nanofabrication at the system level, and will have significant impact on the
              field of optoelectronics and on the physics of heterostructures.
