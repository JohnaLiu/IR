ABSTRACT

Research will be
              conducted on a variety of problems in 
harmonic analysis arising in the study
              of  multilinea
singular integral operators. These  problems are related,
but
              not limited, to the study of the Carleson operator 
and the bilinear Hilbert
              transform. Recently a significant
breakthrough on the bilinear Hilbert
              transform was made 
by the inspiring work of Lacey and Thiele. It turns out
              
that the time-frequency analysis is a powerful tool to 
solve problems
              related to the study of multilinear 
operators. Moreover, although this is
              still under 
investigation,  the analysis of these problems gives us 
hopes
              to solve other important and difficult problems in 
the field, such as the
              Hilbert transform along vector fields, 
the Kakeya problem, and Carleson's
              maximal operator of 
the partial sums of Fourier series in two dimensions.
              
It will also be very interesting to see how 
to use this delicate  analysis
              to solve some problems in 
other fields such as partial differential 
              equations, 
number theory, etc.  Actually, multilinear operators 
have  been
              used in the study of partial differential 
equations, since they naturally
              appear in series expansions 
of solutions of many equations.  

Harmonic
              analysis is  not only an area of theoretical 
mathematics, but also an
              applicable area lying at the
heart of the intersection of fields as diverse as
              optics, 
signal processing, meteorology, and music. The main them
in Harmonic
              analysis is about disassembling and assembling
complicated objects into
              simpler well-understood pieces, 
by analogy to decomposition of intricate
              musical pieces 
into arrangements of a few basic notes. In signal
              processing,
harmonic analysis is used  to detect irregularities of 
signals
              and images. The Fouriertransform is a very  useful 
tool to locate these
              irregularities. The appearance of a 
nonsmooth  symbol inthe study of
              multiplier problems is 
analogous to  physical phenomena where the frequencies
              of 
signals are altered by an abrupt operation, such as  the 
interruption of
              radio communication or television 
transmission by meteorological phenomena.
              Such a sudden 
and unexpected operation  causes the loss of information. 
To
              avoid the loss of information or to retrieve the 
original data is the main
              topic of the theoretical research 
proposed here.
