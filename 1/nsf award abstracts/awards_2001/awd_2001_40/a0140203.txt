Abstract    :
              This research will employ a faculty/student team to develop an epistemological
              study using non-occupational, psychosocial, and personal risk factors to
              predict occupationally related low back pain.  The study will validate the
              usability and predictive power of the "Back Index" model to predict a manual
              materials handling job's risk for producing low back pain. This work will be an
              extension of the work done by the PI at the Texas A&M Ergonomics
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center which will collaborate  in this
              study.  Research results will be incorporated into undergraduate
              teaching.

Low back and trunk injury was responsible for 30% of the 2.8
              million industrial injuries  in 1998.  In 1996 the total cost of industrial
              injuries was $122.6 billion.
