Abstract    :
              SES-0140345 Principal Investigator: J. Craig Jenkins Institution: Ohio State
              University  This Small Grant  for Exploratory Research (SGER) provides funds
              to supplement the existing standard sources of international events data
              (primarily computerized content analyses of Reuters Business Briefs) with a
              field reporting system based on observers in seven Central and South Asian
              countries (Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan,
              Kyrgzstan and Pakistan).  The field reporters are trained in a systematic event
              reporting format that captures many more conflict events than are reported in
              the Reuters sources and provides more comprehensive data for subsequent
              analyses.  The grant would support the training of the field reporters, improve
              their infrastructure, and enlarge the geographic coverage of the reporting
              system.  In addition, the PI will refine the computerized coding of the
              standard news reports to improve their reliability. Comparisons between the two
              sources will be made.  The project will expand the systematic data collection
              of  conflict events in an area of the world that has been under-reported in
              past conflict data files but has become an increasing area of internal and
              international conflict.  The resulting publicly available data will increase
              our ability to test and refine theories of conflict, especially the
              relationships between internal and international conflict.
