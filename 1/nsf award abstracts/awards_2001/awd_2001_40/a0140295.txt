Abstract    :
              Research extending the ideas of quantum defect theory to the interaction of
              atoms at ultra-low kinetic energies is explored.  In contrast to most
              formulations of quantum defect theory, the current methodology is angular
              momentum insensitive.  This is a substantial step forward and has potential
              implications for the simplification of the treatment of multi-channel
              interactions in ultra-cold gases.
