ABSTRACT

The proposed
              research lies at the area of smooth dynamical
systems and ergodic theory. The
              main goal of the project is
to investigate "higher rank" dynamical systems.
              In
particular, the investigator will study actions of discrete
and continuous
              higher rank abelian groups, which are natural
generalizations of
              diffeomorphisms and flows on smooth
manifolds. Higher rank dynamical systems
              appear naturally in
the study of various geometric and algebraic objects.
              The
prime examples of these systems include hyperbolic and
partially
              hyperbolic actions by automorphisms and
translations on compact cosets of Lie
              groups. Using dynamical,
analytic, and group theoretic methods the
              investigator
will study rigidity properties of such systems. The examples
of
              possible rigidity properties include description of
invariant measures,
              regularity of measurable isomorphisms,
and existence of smooth isomorphisms to
              the algebraic models.

Dynamical systems and ergodic theory is a relatively
              new field
of mathematics which studies the evolution of physical
              and
mathematical systems over time, for example planet systems,
air and fluid
              flows. This field originated from the classical
studies in differential
              equations and celestial mechanics.
Dynamics and ergodic theory introduced new
              mathematical tools
into these areas of physics and mechanics, such as the
              study
of the qualitative behavior in the long run as well as various
analytic
              and probabilistic methods. New ideas and concepts in
dynamics, such as
              fractals and chaos, have not only affected
the field itself dramatically, but
              also fundamentally changed
our understanding of the world. The influence of
              the studies
in dynamical systems nowadays goes as far as meteorology,
              
biology, and computer science.
