ABSTRACT

Research
              will be conducted in analysis on fractals.
Analysis on fractals studies the
              properties of functions
defined on fractals, centering on certain analogs
              of
differential equations. Over the past few years, the P.I.
has been
              actively involved in developing this area, in
particular establishing
              connections with more traditional
areas of mathematical analysis, including
              harmonic analysis,
analysis on manifolds, partial differential equations,
              and
numerical analysis.  On a limited class of self-similar
fractals it is
              possible to construct operators that play the
role of the Laplacian, one of
              the central objects in
traditional analysis on Euclidean spaces and
              manifolds.
The work of the P.I. has led to a deeper understanding of
these
              Laplacians.  At the same time he has studied certain
related nonlinear
              problems on these fractals, and has
worked on extending the scope of the
              theory to include a
wider class of fractals.  This project will build on
              and
continue this work. A second area of research is the study
of harmonic
              analysis of fractal measures and functions with
fractal spectrum.   Previous
              research has shown that for a
special class of fractal measures there is a
              generalization
of the theory of Fourier series.  By duality this yields
              a
sampling theorem for functions whose spectrum lies in
certain special
              fractals.  The proposed research will
attempt to find out what happens outside
              this narrow class
of examples.


Analysis on fractals is an emerging area
              with tremendous
potential in both pure and applied mathematics. 
              Scientists
in diverse areas have realized that many objects in the
real world
              can be modeled by fractals, and mathematicians
have been exploring the
              properties of fractal sets and
measures.  This project will enhance the
              mathematical
theory, both by making connections with more traditional
areas
              of mathematics, and by developing numerical tools
that could be used by
              applied mathematicians and scientists
in the future.  This project includes
              collaborative work
with undergraduate students (REU) on computer
              experiments
to explore examples and generate conjectures.  It is
              expected
that this experimental work will lead to deeper
              theoretical
understanding of the subject.
