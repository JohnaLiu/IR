Abstract    :
              The Stanford gravitational wave detection group is working in direct support of
              the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) project
              supported by the NSF.  The research aims to develop cutting edge technologies
              in the areas of: high power lasers; low absorption materials for optics and
              mirror coatings; high-power high-quantum-efficiency photo-detectors; advanced
              interferometer configurations; adaptive-optics; active seismic isolation and
              feedback and control systems. 

The LIGO observatory is being commissioned
              and when operational should give us a glimpse of the range of astronomical
              gravitational wave sources that may be detectable. Gravitational wave sources
              such as interacting black holes, coalescing compact binary systems, stellar
              collapses, pulsars and low-mass x-ray binaries are all possible candidates for
              detection. Observing gravitational wave signals will significantly enhance our
              understanding of the Universe and detectors of higher performance are required
              to exploit the potential of gravitational wave astronomy. The Stanford research
              program is directed towards developing the technology essential to the
              operation of Advanced LIGO and future gravitational wave detectors.
