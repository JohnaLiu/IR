Abstract: The grant will
              support involvement of undergratuate women students 
in cutting edge
              experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center: in the 
high precision
              measurements of electroweak mixing angle at very low momentum
transfer and in
              the first two experiments that will use the new photon 
facility in the SLAC
              End Station A. The photon experiments will measure
nuclear mass dependence of
              J/psi and psi-prime photoproduction cross sections 
and will determine gluon
              spin density in protons from open charm 
photoproduction. Students will
              participate in building  and testing parts of 
detection systems at Smith
              College, and in analysis of data at SLAC.
