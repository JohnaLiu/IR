Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to support experimental studies of heavy quark
              physics with the BaBar Collaboration at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
              The proposed research centers on the study of hadronic decays of the B-meson.
              Such studies are challenging both theoretically, since they are difficult to
              calculate from first principles using Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD), and
              experimentally, since they occur with very small branching ratios.  One focus
              will be on the study of color-suppressed B decays, such as Bo ? Dopo, and tests
              of factorization that express one matrix element which is the product of two
              weak currents as the product of matrix elements of two single-currents. The
              second area of study will be that of semi-leptonic B decays into non-charm
              mesons, such as B ? pln. The goal here is to measure the CKM matrix element Vub
              and test factorization for B-meson decays into two light mesons.
