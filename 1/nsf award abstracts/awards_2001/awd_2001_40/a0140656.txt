Abstract    :
              This fund will support two undergraduate students working on
Jefferson lab
              PrimEx project. They will work on hybrid crystal
calorimeter development, and
              be responsible for the photo-multiplier
tube's examination and selection by
              measuring the linearity and high
rate stability. They will also work on Monte
              Carlo simulation for
the coordinate reconstruction of HYCAL. Upon the
              availability of
travel funds, they may stay at Jefferson Lab for two months in
              the
summer to work on the detector assembling and beam test.
              The
participation of undergraduate students in the physics frontier
research
              will provide them with interesting challenges while
developing skills in many
              areas. Funds from this proposal will
therefore enrich a solid undergraduate
              physics program.
