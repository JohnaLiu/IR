Abstract    :
              This project will develop a terahertz (FHz) wave microscope for microscopic
              sensing and imaging applications. A THz pulse (T-ray) contains information for
              both sensing and imaging applications. Biological and organic compounds have
              distinct signatures within the THz region of the electromagnetic spectrum, such
              as molecular vibrational and rotational levels, and their chemical compositions
              can be examined by this proposed T-ray system. This T-ray microscope is capable
              of sensing and imaging structures at the cell level with a 0.5-p.m spatial
              resolution (1/1000 of one THz wavelength), and it is an exciting new way to
              carry out research projects for biomolecular spectroscopy and T-ray
              imaging.

The microscope will generate and detect picosecond electromagnetic
              pulses (T-ray signal) by using nonlinear optical crystals, ultrafast laser
              pulses and computer analysis. To overcome the wavelength diffraction-limit,
              this approach uses a near-field imaging modality by focusing the optical beams
              into an electro-optic crystal to generate (by optical rectification) and detect
              (by the electro-optic effect) the T-ray to a sub-micron resolution. The imaging
              area of the biomedical tissue, which is attached to the top of the
              electro-optic crystal, is comparable to the optical focal spot, and is
              independent of the THz beam wavelength. This microscope will have a superior
              throughput of THz radiation when compared to any other T-ray microscope.
              Moreover, this device will make significant contributions to student education,
              academic research, instrumentation development, and medical sensing and imaging
              applications.
