Abstract    :
              This project involves research on two different topics in (2+1)-dimensional
              theories.  Increased tractability of these lower dimensional models allows
              explicit calculations that cannot be done in higher dimensional theories. 
              These calculations yield important insights that may also be relevant for
              higher dimensional theories.

1)	Nonperturbative aspects of gauge
              theories.
The PI and collaborators have developed a special matrix
              parametrization for the gauge fields in order to develop a gauge invariant
              Hamiltonian analysis of Yang-Mills theory in (2+1) dimensions.  Recent  results
              will be extended to analyze higher order corrections to the calculated string
              tension, investigate screening versus confinement in this framework, and
              include quark degrees of freedom.

2)	Noncommutative theories and quantum
              Hall effect (QHE).
There has recently appeared an interesting connection
              between QHE and noncommutative field theory.  Previous studies by the PI and
              collaborator indicate that a (noncommutative) finite matrix model proposed by
              Polychronakos to describe fractional quantum Hall fluids of finite extent (for
              a filling fracton of 1/m) does not agree at small distances with standard
              wavefunctions and calls into question the matrix model approach.  The
              correspondence between the matrix model and standard approaches will be
              explored and extended to include more general filling factors and electron
              degrees of freedom.
