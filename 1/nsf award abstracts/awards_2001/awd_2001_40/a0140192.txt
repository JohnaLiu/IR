Abstract    :
              This work addresses questions ranging from the possible charges of 
elementary
              particles to the possible shape of our universe.  The main 
research tool is
              finding and using classical features of diverse physical 
systems.   The
              classical aspects make it feasible for undergraduate as
well as graduate
              students to contribute significantly, also advancing
their own
              education.

Besides the questions, the method itself is important because
              classical
intuition strengthens and speeds the research and eases
              understanding of
the results for other researchers as well as the public at
              large. For
example, properties of the neutrons and protons found in all
              atomic
nuclei may be understood by viewing each such object as a kind of knot,
              and
using experience about how a knot responds to squeezing and to tugging.
