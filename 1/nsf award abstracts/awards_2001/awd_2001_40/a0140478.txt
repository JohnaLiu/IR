Abstract    :
              With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division,
              Professor Josef Michl, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
              Colorado- Boulder, will work on three projects in the area of his traditional
              interest, photophysics and photochemistry. One of the projects is a
              continuation of a current effort to understand heavy atom effects, while two
              are new. In one of the latter, it is proposed to take a fresh angle of attack
              on the venerable problem of the molecular structure responsible for anomalous
              ("TICT") emission from donor-acceptor compounds, and test the proposal that a
              twisted biradicaloid excited state is responsible. In the other, it is proposed
              to separate and evaluate the electronic spectral properties of individual
              conformers of saturated linear chains in a complex conformer mixture. In
              addition, a fourth project is proposed in a research subject that is relatively
              new to this research group. This is a broad effort in the areas opened by the
              recent synthesis of carborane anions and radicals of the type CB11(CH3)12-,
              CB11(CH3)12., CB11(CF3)12-, etc., in the PI's laboratory, and the proposed
              synthesis of the still unknown CB11(CF3)12.. In the previous grant period,
              these compounds were shown to offer new avenues of access to inorganic and
              organometallic reactive intermediates, and their lithium salts catalyze several
              kinds of organic reactions. It is now proposed to explore the applicability of
              these new tools in wide areas of organic and inorganic chemistry. These
              fundamental studies of the synthesis and properties of reactive intermediates
              may have applications in lithium batteries, fuel cell membranes, and catalysts
              for olefin polymerization.
