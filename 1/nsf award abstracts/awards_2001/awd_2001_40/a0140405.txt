Abstract    :
              	There are three main areas of proposed activity. The first one is developing a
              technique based on quasiderivatives of solutions of Ito's equations and
              applying it to processes considered up to the first exit time from domains. The
              second area is investigating smoothness of solutions of SPDEs arising in
              filtering problems and the theory of measure--valued processes in order to be
              able to guarantee certain rates of convergence of approximations to their
              solutions. The third area is estimating the rate of convergence of numerical
              approximations for degenerate controlled diffusion processes. 
	The project
              relates to the investigation of the probabilistic behavior of certain objects.
              Part one is aimed at better understanding of averaged quantities related to
              optimal control of random processes arising in all types of applications from
              finance to aerospace engineering. Part two aims at problems directly related to
              many practical issues such as image reconstruction or high-performance
              computing in eliminating "friendly fire". It is also vital in dealing with
              problems like evolution of bacteria population which may be important in
              biotechnology. Part three deals with ways of solving practical problems of
              optimal control of random processes which arise in the applications mentioned
              above.
