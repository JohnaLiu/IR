This
              proposal from a computer scientist and a social scientist will study the social
              and policy implications and citizen perceptions of government gathering of
              Personally Identifying Information through Federal web sites, and will explore
              the use of alternative privacy-enhancing technologies.  These technologies will
              be evaluated and further developed.  Initial discussions with several
              interested Federal Government agencies have already begun.
