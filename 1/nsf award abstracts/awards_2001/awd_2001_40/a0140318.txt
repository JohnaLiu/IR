Abstract    :
              The research is divided into two parts; 1) low dimensionality effects on
              melting, and 2) stick-slip experments in 2-d crystals.   The PI will search for
              a possible intermediate hexatic state between liquid and solid and study the
              response of  3d structure's to mechanical stress.  The approach should be able
              to yield direct measurements of exact individual particle dynamics and provide
              answers to many fundamental questions.
