Abstract    :
              Three topics  in cold-atom physics are investigated.  First, low-energy
              collisions with dipolar interactions are studied to provide a realistic
              assesment of the effect of laser induced dipoles in atomic gases.  Second,
              evaporation and loading dynamics are studied in far off resonance traps. 
              Finally, squeezing and entanglement in spinor-1 condensates are examined for
              quantum correlations and the effect on qunatum information science.
