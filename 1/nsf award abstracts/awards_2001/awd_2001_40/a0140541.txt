Abstract    :
              This project, submitted under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
              program, will examine public attitudes toward civil liberties following the
              attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  In particular, the
              researchers will conduct a national survey to probe how public anxiety and fear
              influence support for civil liberties and personal freedom.  The survey will
              ask whether respondents are willing to limit their own personal freedom, the
              freedom of people who are like them, or those who are different from them.  It
              is exactly the fact that efforts to constrict personal freedom are motivated by
              a threat to public safety that allows the researchers to question whether
              people are differentially committed to civil liberties norms.  The study will
              test whether during a time of widespread social anxiety, people view civil
              liberty standards as universal or instead as more of a way to constrain the
              behavior of others - in particular those who are viewed as different from the
              respondent in ethnicity, race, or citizenship.
