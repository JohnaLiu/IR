Abstract    :
              This proposal supports an experimental research program that studies atomic
              coherence and interference phenomena in cold atoms, and explores related
              applications in nonlinear optics and quantum optics. The approach is based on
              interactions of multilevel atoms with multiple laser fields that lead to
              electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and dramatic enhancement of
              optical nonlinearities.   Cold atoms confined in a magneto-optical trap (MOT)
              are well suited for this type of fundamental studies because of the high atomic
              density in a MOT and the near zero Doppler shift experienced by the atoms. The
              objectives are to study nonlinear optical phenomena manifested by quantum
              coherence and interference at low light intensities and carry out nonlinear
              spectroscopic measurements in coherently prepared rubidium atoms. Specific
              experiments include giant Kerr nonlinearities manifested by EIT, absorptive
              photon switching at the single-photon energy level, the EIT enhanced four-wave
              mixing at low light intensities and its application in photon storage and
              recall, experimental quantification of dark-state decoherence, and the
              time-dependent response of the EIT medium. The program provides research
              related education and training activities for graduate and undergraduate
              students, especially for minority students, who make up more than 65% of the
              total student population at Florida International University.
