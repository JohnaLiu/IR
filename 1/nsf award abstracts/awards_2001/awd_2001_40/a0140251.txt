Abstract    :
              This one-year NSF support is solely used for the support of graduate
students
              in their thesis research on (1) the physics and technology
of beam cooling and
              (2) applications of quadrupole-mode transfer
functions in beam manipulation,
              measurements of beam properties,
etc.  The beam cooling techniques can provide
              high brightness beams
for high energy and nuclear physics research with higher
              precision
and higher luminosity. The quadrupole-mode transfer function can
              be
used to manipulate beams distribution for emittance measurements,
space
              charge compensation, and impedance measurements.
