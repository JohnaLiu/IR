Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funds to implement and evaluate a model of instructional
              strategies for
prekindergarten teachers in order to enhance their ability to
              support young childre's 
learning in language, early literacy, and math. The
              model will be experimentally tested 
across Head Start and public school
              educational settings and is guided by a strong body of 
recent research. As
              the two settings have different goals for children, funding of this 
proposal
              will provide important information on the conditions under which the model is
              
effective. The outcomes of this research will determine critical elements for
              models of 
instructional approaches such as intensity and duration, teacher
              background characteristics,
 role of mentor teachers, and the importance of
              including a home literacy component. The 
model is based on research that has
              clearly established a group of key elements for 
prekindergarten
              language/literacy programs (e.g., expressive language, vocabulary, early
              
reading skills). Results will answer a critical remaining question regarding
              how a model 
of instructional strategies can support teachers to implement a
              comprehensive set of 
teaching practices supporting language/literacy
              development in ways that are sensitive to 
the broadest range of social,
              emotional, and cognitive needs of young children.
