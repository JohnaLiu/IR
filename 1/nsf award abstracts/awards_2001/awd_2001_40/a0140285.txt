Abstract    :
              This project will study the production and properties of Rydberg states of
              laser-cooled rubidium inside a holographic atom trap (HAT). The HAT is produced
              by sending a high power continuous-wave YAG laser though a holographic phase
              element, then imaging the diffraction pattern onto a cloud of atoms formed
              inside a dark magneto-optical trap. The resulting trap is an array of lattice
              sites that strongly confines atoms in three dimensions.  Each lattice site
              contains thousands of atoms at densities more than two orders of magnitude
              higher than in a magneto-optical trap. Traps of similar design are of great
              current interest for Rydberg atom quantum computation.  Narrow-band excitation
              of Rydberg states in high density atom clouds has been recently predicted to be
              strongly affected by the "dipole-blockade "collisional effect in which the
              presence of a single excited Rydberg state can frequency shift neighboring
              atoms out of resonance with the excitation light.  The HAT  will be used to
              study this process at densities comparable to those needed for mesoscopic
              Rydberg quantum computation.
