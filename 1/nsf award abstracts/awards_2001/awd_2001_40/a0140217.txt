Abstract    :
              This award provides support for the Institute for Theoretical Atomic and
              Molecular Physics (ITAMP) at the Harvard/Smithsonian.  The funds are used for a
              postdoctoral program, a long and short term visitor program and for wokshops. 
              The postdoctoral students are provided a unique atmosphere where they can work
              freely with the Harvard faculty or staff members of the Smithsonian.  The
              visitor program provides a focus for bringing together geographically dispersed
              members of the AMO community to work together or separately on problems of
              current interest in atomic, molecular and optical theory.  The workshops, which
              are attended on a regular basis by senior and junior scientists, students, and
              postdoctorals are devoted to current "hot" topics in the field or are designed
              to focus the community on subjects of broad interest.
