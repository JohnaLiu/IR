Abstract    :
              This project deals with questions from pluri-potential
theory and dynamics in
              several complex variables. 
Pluri-potential theory is the higher dimensional
              version
of potential theory in the complex plane. The 
investigator plans to
              study certain classes of 
pluricomplex Green functions for the complex
              
Monge-Ampere operator, from the point of view of their
foliation structure
              and also in relation to some questions
from algebraic geometry. A second goal
              of the project is 
to consider polynomial estimates of Bernstein-Walsh
              type
related to graphs of entire transcendental functions.
The investigator
              plans to study certain properties of
entire functions from this point of view.
              Such properties
are also of interest in transcendental number
              theory.
Finally, the investigator is concerned with studying the
dynamics of
              classes of polynomial automorphisms in
higher dimensions.

Complex analysis
              in one and in higher dimensions has
important connections with many fields of
              pure and applied
mathematics and, indeed, with other sciences. It is
              often
the case that one gains insight about concrete problems 
once they are
              formulated in the context of complex numbers.
This is because of the powerful
              methods and tools developed
in the study of holomorphic functions in complex
              analysis.
Studying complex dynamical systems proved to be important
for
              understanding the behavior of more complicated real 
dynamical systems arising
              in mathematics as well as in 
physics and biology.
