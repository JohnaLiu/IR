PI: Karen A. High
Institution: Oklahoma State University
Proposal
              Number: 0140608

The Woman's Initiative Committee Session entitled "Women
              Engineering Sucess from the Inside Out" will be held at the annual American
              Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) meeting in Reno, Nevada.  It will be a
              full morning session from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. with speakers including women
              from industry, academia government.   Some of the presentations include:
 -   
              Barbara Todd, from Phillips Petroleum, presenting "A History of Four Female  
              
Chemical Engineering Graduates from the 1930's."
-     Carol Muller, from
              MentorNet, discussing "Opening the 'Black Box' of Mentoring".
- Valerie Young,
              from Making Waves, detaling "Overcoming the Imposter Syndrome:   
       A
              workshop for Women."
-     Peggy Layne, from the National Academy of
              Engineering, describing the "NAE Program on Diversity in the Engineering
              Workforce."
The presentations will be followed by a luncheon sponsored by
              corporate sponsors, hopefully to attract 50 to 75 chemical engineering
              professionals, faculty members and graduate students.

The session is a part
              of a more comprehensive program to help women at all stages of their careers -
              from graduate student to tenured faculty as well as women in various industrial
              positions in the chemical process industries - to advance in their careers. 
              Some of the women are pregnant and can not attend the meeting.  Arrangements
              have been made for two-way video conferencing.  Philips Petroleum is covering
              half of the expense, NSF the other half.
