Abstract    :
              This is an excellent example of a successful program at an undergraduate
              institution. The PI has focussed his efforts on experiments of a scale that
              allows his undergraduate students to participate effectively. All of the
              experiments are at the "sensitivity frontier" and even with a comparatively
              large teaching load, the PI has established leadership positions. Further, he
              is addressing workforce related issues by coordinating the recruitment of
              African - American students.
