Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the study of the effects of varying the strength of the
              atomic interactions in a binary, two-spin-state Bose-Einstein Condensate in
              Rb-87.  Two avenues of research will be pursued.  In the first series of
              experiments the physics of a Feshbach resonance will be uniquely examined using
              the double-condensate system.  In these experiments the second condensate
              component is used as a tool that permits approaching the resonance suddenly
              from both sides, and in a novel manner.  In the second series of experiments
              the Feshbach resonance will be used to create binary Bose fluid systems of
              varying interaction strengths, with a particular emphasis on the physics of
              component separation.  In this set of experiments the second component serves
              as a phase reference for interferometric studies of a condensate in the
              vicinity of a resonance.
