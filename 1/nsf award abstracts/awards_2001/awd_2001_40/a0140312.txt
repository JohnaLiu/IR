Abstract    :
              This work examines two aspects of the interaction of light and matter under
              conditions of strong response:  1) supercontinuum generation (SCG), the
              dramatic transfer of pump photons to modes covering a broad spectrum and 2)
              adiabatic passage (AP) in atoms, the transfer of atomic population from one
              state to another via pulses in "counter-intuitive" sequence.   SCG is
              fundamentally important to the study of intense pulse propagation through media
              and has found important application in the generation of tunable short laser
              pulses, high-speed communication systems, frequency metrology, and medical
              diagnostics.  AP is a robust and efficient technique for population transfer
              which has found useful application in atom optics and quantum measurement.
              Experiments will be undertaken to examine the details of SCG in order to
              establish understanding at a fundamental level.  AP will be explored through
              the use of shaped laser pulses and via various intermediate states.
