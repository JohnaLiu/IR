Abstract    :
              This project consists of a series of relatively small-scale experiments using
              lasers and atoms which will address fundamental questions about physics of the
              electroweak interaction as well as other possible symmetry-violating
              interactions. Recent atomic parity nonconservation (PNC) experiments in several
              elements have attained very high precision. However, before new experimental
              results can lead to fundamental insights, the effects of the complex atomic
              structure of the relevant atoms must be understood. In thallium, new atomic
              structure calculations presently underway have the potential to make this
              element a particularly important system for testing electroweak physics.
              Recently completed transition amplitude, and hyperfine splitting measurements,
              as well as Stark shift and Stark-induced amplitude measurements now underway in
              our laboratory provide some of the first high-precision atomic structure tests
              in this element.  Experiments using very similar techniques will be undertaken
              in other atomic systems of potential importance to electroweak tests such as
              lead. These experiments make use of diode laser systems and thallium samples in
              heated vapor cells as well as an atomic beam apparatus.  The experiments will
              serve as ideal research training for undergraduate physics majors, the large
              majority of whom attend graduate school in the physical sciences.
