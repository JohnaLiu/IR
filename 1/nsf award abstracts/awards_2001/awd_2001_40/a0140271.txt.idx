Abstract    :
              SES-0140271 PI: Mehdi Bozorgmehr CUNY Graduate School  The research focuses
              on the backlash that targets Middle Eastern and South Asian (MESA) Americans in
              the aftermath of the September 11, 20001 terrorist attacks on America.  It is a
              well known sociological finding that external hostility leads to internal group
              solidarity to advance its goals and objectives.  Past sociological models of
              conflict and solidarity based on studies of Jews, Asians and Cubans are based
              on assumptions of different forms of economic or political competition between
              groups. The investigator acknowledges that these structural models are useful,
              but notes that inter-ethnic relations are often more dynamic and may be
              dictated by global forces between the sending and host societies. Thus, the PI
              proposes to develop an alternative model of inter-ethnic relations, arguing
              that the main source of host hostility of Middle Easterners, unlike the groups
              listed above, is the anti-American policies of the Middle Eastern and South
              Asian regimes (or terrorists) rather than the action of the exiles and
              immigrants themselves. Also, MESA Americans are panethnic and have not created
              group solidarity, but are instead represented by various national religious and
              ethnic organizations.  The investigator will study the current backlash by
              examining the role of  religious and ethnic MESA organizations in averting,
              coping and responding to the backlash against MESA in response to the events of
              September 11th.  The investigator will interview leaders of approximately 50 of
              these national ethnic and religious organizations; presently the only existing
              organs that can act on behalf of their respective communities in response to
              the current crisis.   The project is significant on three levels: (1)
              historically because data will be collected on the crisis, as it unfolds; (2)
              substantively because our knowledge of a understudied minority groups in
              American will be enhanced; and (3) theoretically because the research will
              contribute our general understanding of inter-ethnic group conflict.
