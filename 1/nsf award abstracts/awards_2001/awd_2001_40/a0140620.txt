Abstract    :
              This project requests travel support for 18 participants from U.S. universities
              in the Student Paper Competition at the 2002 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave
              Symposium (IMS). The IMS is the annual meeting of the Microwave Theory and
              Techniques Society (MTT-S) of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
              Engineers. Inc. (IEEE). The IMS is also the major international symposium in
              the microwave field and a focus of research results in wireless
              telecommunications. The 2002 IMS will be held in Seattle, WA, USA on June 2-7,
              2002.

Each year, the Microwave Theory and Techniques Society promotes
              student education in microwave theory and techniques through a number of
              mechanisms. One of the most important is the Student Paper Competition at the
              IMS. This selective program brings the best students from around the world
              together in an integrated program in which they present their work not only to
              a technical audience but also to a group of judges. The program helps develop
              the technical acumen of the students as well as their communication and
              presentation skills. It also helps introduce them to the international
              technical community and helps to build a community of students who will lead
              the next generation of microwave engineers.

The IMS provides financial
              support of various forms but does not reimburse travel expenses. Travel support
              from NSF will ensure that the program is open to the widest range of interested
              applicants from U.S. universities.
