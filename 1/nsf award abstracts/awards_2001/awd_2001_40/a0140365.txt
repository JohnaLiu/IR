Einstein both proposed and retracted an addition of a
              cosmological constant Lambda 
term to his equations describing gravity as
              curvature of space and time. Recent 
observations indicate the presence of a
              small, positive Lambda. 
As shown by the PI and collaborators, the notions of
              spin and mass 
are mathematically richer if this the case. The project will in
              part be devoted to a 
study of these new phenomena. In addition, the
              theoretical understanding of 
what a quantum theory of gravitation might look
              like, has significantly advanced 
in a large part through studies of string
              theories which replace particle excitations 
with those of fundamental
              strings. Strikingly, many new results in mathematics 
have arisen from these
              considerations. The PI will investigate various 
aspects of this math/physics
              interplay, including a generalization of strings to membranes, 
random
              matrices and supersymmetry.
