Abstract

This proposal was received in response to NSE,
              NSF-0019.  The project is focused on the study of two major nanoscale
              phenomena:  (a)  phonon transport in single crystal silicon layer of thickness
              in the range of 10-50 nm and (b)  ballistic phonon transport near hotspots (
              appr. 10 nm) in the active region of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) transistors. 
              The experimental part of the study involves the very first measurements of
              thermal conductivity of nanometer size, single crystal silicon layer and
              ballistic phonon transport near a hotspot in a transistor.  Transient and
              steady state heat transfer experiments on nanostructures at both room and
              cryogenic temperatures will be performed to reveal the fundamentals of phonon
              transport at nanometer scales.  The theoretical effort focuses on numerical
              simulations of phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) in the relaxation time
              approximation, accounting for phonon dispersion as well as frequency dependent
              phonon mean free paths in silicon.  The analytical work will take advantage of
              the experimental data and numerical simulations to introduce simple, yet
              physically realistic, expressions for phonon transport in nanostructures, which
              can be used for rapid electrical/thermal simulation.
