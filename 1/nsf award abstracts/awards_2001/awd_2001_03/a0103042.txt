Abstract    :
              Survey of Orthopteroid Insects of Hispaniola

The rapidly expanding human
              population is putting great pressure on the Hispaniolan forests and other
              natural areas.  Many species have probably gone extinct.  Others are
              endangered.  This project will assist in the biotic inventory of insects by
              intensively surveying the orthopteroid insects (crickets, katydids,
              grasshoppers, cockroaches, mantids, and stick insects).  Despite their
              ubiquitous presence and significance in agriculture, the orthopteroids are
              poorly known in Hispaniola.

The specific goals of the project are to sample
              a variety of habitats with special emphasis on the mountain reserve areas,
              identify the known species, describe and name the species not yet known to
              science, provide keys on the internet to identify the species (and information
              on the habitats and distributions of species), and collaborate with local
              biologists in building an infrastructure for future Hispaniolan entomological
              research. 

The oldest parts of Hispaniola are about 105 million years old. 
              Because of its age and proximity to the rich Neotropical biota, Hispaniola has
              the third highest plant diversity of the world's oceanic islands.  It is
              expected that the insect diversity, once known, will be huge, perhaps
              comparable to that of the continental tropics.  The total number of recorded
              Orthopteroids from Hispaniola is 238; however, the actual number may be as much
              as six times the number presently known. 

Because of the pioneering use of
              the internet to provide taxonomic information, this project will almost
              immediately benefit the local infrastructure of biodiversity studies in
              Hispaniola and will help to promote entomological research. The principal
              vehicle for communicating the results will be an existing global taxonomic
              database to orthopteroid insects (Orthoptera Species File Online:
              http://viceroy.eeb.uconn.edu/orthoptera).
