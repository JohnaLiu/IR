Abstract    :
              Divisions of Chemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, Chemical Transport
              Systems, Computer-Communications Research, and Experimental and Integrated
              Activities support this multidivisional award to University of Illinois
              Urbana-Champaign. This Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team (NIRT) award
              is part of the Nanoscale Science and Engineering program.  Under this project,
              an interdisciplinary team with Joseph Lyding as the principal investigator will
              develop protein-based logic chips that interfaces between biochemical reactions
              and conventional microfabricated silicon-based electronics such as metal-oxide
              semiconductor (MOSFETs) taking advantage of biocomplexity and electronic speed.
               These protein interfaced MOSFETs will help to create atomically accurate
              protein arrays to function as cellular nonlinear/neural network, and this in
              turn will help to over come the 100 nm limit in miniaturization of the present
              transistor technology.  Industrial collaborations and outreach programs in the
              K-12 system will be part of the project. 

Under the award, ordered and
              atomically accurate protein arrays that interfaces between biochemical
              reactions and conventional microfabricated silicon-based electronics will be
              developed. Strong industrial collaboration will help in the industrial
              development and technology transfer of this science.  In addition, the research
              program will provide multidisciplinary education and training opportunities in
              materials chemistry, protein chemistry and electronics to students from K-12 to
              post doctoral candidates.
