NGS Performance Modeling
              of Complex Hardware/Software Systems through Mixed Level Modeling

This
              project will develop a revolutionary new capability by providing a unified
              design framework for complex, high performance computer systems.  This
              framework includes a performance modeling environment that will be integrated
              into a mixed level hardware/software design environment through the use of
              standard Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and supporting design tools. 
              This framework will allow the modeling of hardware and software systems at a
              high level to enable rapid design space exploration and system performance
              analysis.  The framework will provide the capability to refine these high level
              designs in a step-wise manner into models with more design detail and,
              ultimately into an implementation.  This step-wise refinement capability allows
              areas of the design that are determined to be "high risk" in terms of
              performance to be refined to a more detailed level where the effects on system
              performance of assumptions and design can be realized.
