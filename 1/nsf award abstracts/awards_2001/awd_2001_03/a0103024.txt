Abstract    :
              This Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Teams (NIRT) project it to develop
              robust routes to produce high-density arrays of functional nanoscopic
              structures using nanoporous templates derived from diblock copolymer thin
              films. The diblock copolymer films used possess self-assembled cylindrical
              microdomains oriented normal to the surface of the film, with cylinder
              densities in excess of 1.0 x 10^12 /in^2.  Selective degradation of the minor
              polymer block and cross-linking of the major block results in a polymer film
              having a high-density array of nanopores that serves as a template for the
              fabrication of functional arrays of nanoscopic structures. The project will
              expand the potential of this simple process by developing methods that give
              pore diameters ranging from the nanometer to the hundreds of nanometers. The
              research will advance the use of these templates to produce functional arrays
              of nanoscopic structures.  This includes the use of metal electrodeposition in
              the template pores to produce ultrahigh-density arrays of magnetic nanowires
              for magnetic storage applications. The nanopore array can be patterned
              laterally using electron-beam lithography, to create magnetic nanowires and
              nanoparticle electron-transport studies.  The nanoporous arrays will also be
              used as electrochemical nanoelectrode arrays, as reactive-ion-etching masks for
              silicon technology, and to produce glass nanopillars.  

The project provides
              several unique educational opportunities including REU, RET, an
              interdepartmental nanoscience course, biweekly interdisciplinary meetings, and
              a technology-training program based on interactive digital video. This project
              integrates efforts from the academic and industrial sectors, with
              collaborations from national laboratories and international groups.
