Scalable I/O Management
              & Access Optimizations for Scientific Applications for High-Performance
              Computing

The main objective of this proposal is to address the problem of
              large-scale storage, performance management of I/O, automatic performance
              optimizations of I/O using historical information and access patterns, data
              management, analysis, and access using simple interfaces which permit flow of
              access information to lower levels software for exploiting higher level
              information.  Furthermore, since analysis at such a scale is simply not
              feasible if done manually (e.g., visualization alone or off-line analysis),
              integration of on-line analysis and feature extraction while simulations and
              experiments are executing is very important.  Our observation is that neither
              parallel file systems nor runtime systems and database management systems
              (DBMS) fully-address the large-scale data management problem, as they lack
              global information about the applications access patterns and most of them are
              not effective in handling storage hierarchies.

We believe that the results
              from the proposed research will enable scientists to address one of the most
              important bottlenecks in computational simulation cycles; namely, the
              bottleneck of analyzing and managing massive data in high-performance
              distributed computing environment (such as Grid).
