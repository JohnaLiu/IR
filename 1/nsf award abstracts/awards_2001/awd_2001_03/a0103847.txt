Abstract    :
              The twentieth century saw the rise and fall of Marxist practices.  At the
              beginning of the century, the international communist movement was a growing
              social and political force inspired by emancipatory ideas, but by its end the
              movement has virtually disappeared.  Today, the movement is mostly talked about
              in association with totalitarian and authoritarian regimes of the past. 
              However, at least two twentieth century communist parties can lay claim to more
              democratic histories and hopeful futures: the South African Communist Party and
              the Community Party of India in Kerala.  Both parties represent exceptions to
              the historical norms of twentieth century international communism.  Yet, the
              two parties also differ: in Kerala the party developed a participatory
              democratic orientation, and in South Africa the party developed a
              representative democratic orientation. Through the comparative method, this
              project examines why the two parties diverged after having developed by the
              late 1950s broadly similar democratic commitments and orientations.  Based on
              interviews with party leaders, activists, and members, and access to party
              papers, memos, correspondence, and reports, the investigator identifies the
              conditions that facilitate the growth and development of various types of
              democratic communism.
