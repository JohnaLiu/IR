Abstract    :
              Professor Mary Berry of the University of South Dakota is supported by the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the excited state decay
              dynamics of vapor phase lanthanide complexes.  These experiments represent the
              first application of spectroscopic molecular beam methods to the case of
              lanthanide complexes, complementing studies by others on alkali, alkaline earth
              and transition metals.  Resonance Enhanced Multiphoton Ionization (REMPI)
              spectroscopy will be employed to investigate europium (III) complexed with
              organic ligands.   The initial focus will be on the feasibility of REMPI
              detection in these molecular systems.  These gas phase studies will allow the
              spectroscopy and dynamics to be determined without the convoluting factors of
              crystal strain and solvent and ion interactions.  

Lanthanide compounds are
              important in energy applications and are used as materials for lasers, for
              example.  A more thorough understanding of the spectroscopy of these compounds
              will prove useful in developing new optical materials. The PI has an excellent
              mentoring record including Native American students.
