Abstract    :
              This award to Ohio State University by the Chemistry Division is part of the
              Nanoscale Exploratory Research in the Nanoscale Science and Engineering
              program.  Under this project, Jonathan Parquette will develop novel
              enantioselective catalysts based on the active transition metals, such as
              ruthenium and copper, incorporated in chiral dendrimers. Monodendrons up to
              three generations will be prepared using aminopyridine dicarboxamide as the
              branching units, and chiral nonracemic anthranilamide as the terminal units. 
              Dendrimers with transition metals will be evaluated for enhanced catalytic
              Diels-Alder and aldol condensation reactions.  In addition, the research
              program will provide education and training opportunities in material chemistry
              to graduate and undergraduate students.

Under the award, novel
              enantioselective catalysts based on the active transition metals in chiral
              dendrimers will be studied. Dendrimers, with up to three generations, will be
              synthesized and their conformationally based chiral changes in different
              solvents will be evaluated using circular dichroism.  In addition, different
              metals selectively placed at the periphery of dendrimers will be evaluated for
              enhanced catalytic activities for the organic synthesis of chiral materials. 
              The research program will provide education and training opportunities in
              materials chemistry to graduate and undergraduate students.
