The proposed project consists of two
              related research 
topics. The first part is research in conformal geometry.
              
The second part is a continuation of the research of 
formation and
              structure of singularity developed along 
geometric flows. For conformal
              geometry part it takes surface 
theory as the guideline of geometry in higher
              dimension. The 
theory of conformally flat structure, in 4 dimension for
              
instance, has not been so successful because of the lack of 
right analytic
              tools, in our view point.  But it seems that 
some replacement of complex
              analysis by theory of fourth 
order PDE is found to be very promising to study
              conformal 
geometry. Therefore the  main thread in the part of this 
proposed
              research is to further develop conformal geometry 
with those newly developed
              analytic tools. The proposed 
research takes a fundamental and comprehensive
              approach 
to the study of conformal geometry. It will significantly 
enhance
              and develop the conformal geometry.  It will also 
provide some ways to better
              understand topology in 3 and 4 
dimension. For the second part of this
              proposed project we 
continue our research in the study of formation and
              structure 
of singularity developed along the heat flow for harmonic 
maps
              from surfaces. It is always very interesting to 
understand the behavior of
              the flow across the finite time 
singularity. The better understanding of the
              finite time 
singularity is believed to be very helpful in further
              
applications of the theory of harmonic maps in topology and 
physics.

The
              development of conformal geometry has a very long 
history and extensive
              literature. It is intimately tied with
modern physics as we have seen it in
              conformal field theory.
Particularly it becomes even more important as the
              correspondence 
between quantum gravity and conformal field theory
              relatively
well understood in physics demands mathematical foundation,
              as
well as stimulates development in conformal geometry. Therefore
it is
              clear that conformal geometry is an exciting frontier of
modern sciences.
              Singularities naturally develop in many 
mathematical models for almost
              everything in sciences. Singularity,
for instance, develop when some
              parameters in the physical system 
approach certain critical values, like
              Ginzburg-Landau model in 
super-conductivity and super-fluids. To study the
              singularities in 
evolution systems have been the major problems in the theory
              of 
partial differential equations with tremendous applications to 
many
              physical and engineering fields. Any essential analytic 
progress in this line
              will greatly attract attention from experts 
in all related areas. At last,
              but not the least, the proposed 
project is also generating research
              activities to the benefit
of the graduate program in the Department of
              Mathematics at UCSC.
