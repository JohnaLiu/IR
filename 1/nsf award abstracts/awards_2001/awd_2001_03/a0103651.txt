Concrete issues proposed in this project are the
              study
of 2-variable elliptic genus and chiral deRham complex
for non-singular
              and singular varieties,
mathematical foundations of the second quantized
              elliptic
genus and orbifold elliptic genus,
ODE and PDE appearing in mirror
              symmetry, the Chern
classes of mirrors and the topology of the
complements as
              well as the study of the fundamental groups
of the complements.

The goal of
              this project is to analyze from
mathematical point of view several methods
              and
techniques which were used in theoretical physics,
more precisely in
              string theory. Such mathematical
investigation should lead to new results
              in
the physical theories involved and produce a
broader understanding of the
              reasons of effectiveness
of the methods used by physicists.
Particular
              problems which we are planning to solve
are motivated by dualities in  string
              theory
and more specifically by mirror correspondence.
One of the problems is
              to find new properties
of mirror correspondence and its
              characterization.
This involved the study in topology, algebraic geometry
and
              differential equations.
