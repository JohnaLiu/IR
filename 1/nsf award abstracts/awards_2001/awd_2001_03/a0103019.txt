Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Hungarian research project involves Michael Maroney of the University
              of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Csaba Bagyinka of the Institute of Biophysics at
              the Hungarian Biological Research Center, Szeged. They intend to examine the
              biological processes in hydrogenase reaction mechanisms, which catalyze the
              reversible two-electron redox chemistry of dihydrogen.  The project features
              work with the enzyme Thiocapsa roseopersicina.

Theory suggests a number of
              possibilities for structures of T. roseopersicina catalytic intermediates which
              the international team will test by spectroscopic and other physical probes. 
              To do so the researchers plan to use time-resolved FTIR studies for determining
              the species involved in catalysis.  They will characterize interconversions and
              their rates, hoping to detect kinetic intermediates and follow evolving
              thermodynamic microstates.  The US-Hungarian partners specifically seek answers
              to questions about what roles protons play in determining the charge on active
              sites, what redox states are involved in catalysis, or whether protonated
              cysteines are present.  If successful, findings may provide clues applicable to
              conversion of chemical energy to electricity for fuel cells and to storage of
              solar energy in chemical form via photochemical hydrogen production.
 
This
              international project in biophysics research fulfills the program objective of
              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the Untied States and
              Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in
              areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
