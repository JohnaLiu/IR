The past 1,000
              years witnessed the transition of North Pacific hunter-gatherers from small,
              egalitarian family-based groups to complex hunter-gatherers.  The upper and
              lower Pacific coast of the Alaska Peninsula, Kodiak, and the Aleutian Islands
              were intensely inhabited prehistorically, and after 1,000 B.P. the residents
              were taking part in a greater southwest Alaska cultural interaction sphere. 
              However, there is little information about the prehistoric and historic
              inhabitants of the central Alaska Peninsula Pacific coast.  The project will
              retrieve archaeological and environmental data from the Portage Bay watershed. 
              The goal is to better define the central Alaska Peninsula with regard to
              subsistence and settlement strategies compared to those of the greater Alaska
              Peninsula through time.  The project will utilize ethnohistoric and
              ethnographic data now being gathered about the subsistence-settlement systems
              of the historic inhabitants of Portage Bay.  The project will contribute to
              recording and preserving the prehistoric and historic traditions and cultural
              heritage of the Alutiiq people and others
