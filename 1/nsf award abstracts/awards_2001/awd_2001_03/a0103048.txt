Abstract    :
              This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019.   The award supports
              the construction and application of an electric Stark-effect coupled infrared
              near field microscope.  This will be a powerful new tool for the analysis of
              the chemical composition of surface nanostructures on 50-100 nm length scales,
              which are the critical scales for polymer nanotechnologies.
