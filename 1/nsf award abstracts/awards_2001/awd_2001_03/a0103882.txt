Abstract for DMS - 0103882

The proposed research program seeks to gain a
              deeper  understanding of
the dynamical phenomena of non hyperbolic systems
              with singularities. 
The main goal is to investigate the interplay  between
              dynamics and the
growth and structure of  generating groups, the number
              theoretic
properties of the defining parameters, and the topology and geometry
              of
restricting domains  and the induced symbolic dynamical systems. 
The
              scope of the program includes generalizations of interval exchanges,
polygonal
              dual billiard maps, piecewise isometries.



This program is in  dynamical
              systems, an active area of mathematics
whose main objective is to study long
              term behavior of objects under
applications of the same mathematical
              principle. Apart from applications
in other areas of mathematics, the proposed
              program will have
implications in Electrical Engineering, in particular in
              digital
filters. Digital filters, are algorithms used commonly in
              electrical
components that built in  many wireless and voice recognition
              devices.
