Abstract    :
              This  Nanoscale Exploratory Research (NER) award to Clemson University is
              cofunded by Divisions of Chemistry (MPS), and Design, Manufacturing and
              Industrial Innovations (ENG), and is part of the Nanoscale Science and
              Engineering program.  Under this project, George Chumanov will develop novel
              techniques to simultaneously synthesize and assemble silver nanoparticles in
              multidimensional structures with nanoscale spacing.  Monodispersed silver
              nanoparticles with tunable optical properties will be formed by liquid droplet
              formation and hydrogen reduction with electrostatic focusing for particle
              transport and assembly on different substrates.  This electrostatic focusing
              method could develop a new bench-top technology for routine particle deposition
              in the nanometer range and spacing.  In addition, the research project will
              provide education and training opportunities to undergraduate students in the
              assembly, processing and characterization of nano particles with specialized
              optical properties.  

Under the award, novel monodispersed silver
              nanoparticles with tunable optical properties will be formed by liquid droplet
              formation and hydrogen reduction. Electrostatic focusing will be used to
              transport and assemble nanoparticles on different substrates. These
              multidimensional regular arrays of nanoparticles are expected to be robust, and
              could be used in next generation photonic and optoelectronic devices. The
              method once fully developed could provide a bench-top procedure for routine
              nanoparticle deposition.
