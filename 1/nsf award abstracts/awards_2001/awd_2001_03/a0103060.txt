Abstract    :
              This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019.   Features of the
              Casimir force will be explored for nanometer separations.  In particular,
              evidence will be sought for the demonstration of repulsive and lateral Casimir
              forces.   Such forces have never been experimentally demonstrated and could
              play an important role in the fabrication and control of electromechanical
              devices as MEMS approaches NEMS.
