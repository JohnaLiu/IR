A Framework for Developing
              Complex Applications On High-End Petaflop-Class Machines

This research
              proposes to develop novel software technologies for supporting the design and
              implementation of complex applications on next-generation high-performance
              computers such as the IBM Blue Gene machine, the teraflop-class systems of the
              ASCI program, and the architecture (s) proposed in the NSF peta-flops
              point-design studies.

Future high-performance computers such as these will
              have large numbers of processors (from a few thousand to several hundred
              thousands, or even more), and a complex multilevel memory hierarchy with
              memories physically distributed across different parts of the machine.  To use
              such machines effectively, enormous amounts of parallelism must be exposed in
              user programs, and careful attention must be paid to the latency and bandwidth
              of access to different levels of the memory hierarchy.  The applications
              enabled by such high-end machines are also expected to be significantly more
              complex and dynamic than applications in the past.  Therefore, supporting the
              development of such applications on next-generation high-end computers is a
              major software challenge.
