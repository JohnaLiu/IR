              Research: SmartApps: An Application Centric Approach to High Performance
              Computing

The objective of this proposal is to develop new methods that
              allows runtime performance optimization by an enhanced monitoring, resource
              modeling, evaluation and remapping of the application at runtime, depending on
              runtime resources and application performance.  The specific approaches to be
              pursued include application algorithm adaptation, run-time software
              optimization, system configuration selection and tuning reconfigurable OS
              services.
