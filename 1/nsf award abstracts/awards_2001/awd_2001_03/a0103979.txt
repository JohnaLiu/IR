Title: Some Studies on Microtexture and
              Acoustoelasticity in Polycrystalline Media

To the naked eye, the polished
              surface of a metal sheet appears as a homogeneous continuum. Under the
              metallographer's microscope the same surface reveals, after etching, an
              underlying polycrystalline structure. Many materials, including metals, ice and
              rocks, are aggregates of tiny
crystals or grains, which assume different
              orientations in space and are separated by interfaces called grain boundaries.
              Comprehensive mapping of grain boundaries and individual grain orientations in
              polycrystals has recently become possible with the emergence of orientation
              imaging microscopy. Details about grain orientations, e.g., the misorientations
              of neighboring grains, are called microtexture. Microtexture could exert a
              strong influence on the mechanical behavior of polycrystalline materials (e.g.,
              on the volume of backscattered ultrasonic noise, which
at sufficiently high
              levels renders ultrasound totally useless for material flaw detection in
              aircraft engines; an undetected metallurgical defect in the No. 2 engine was
              the culprit for the crash of a United Airlines DC-10 in 1989).

The main
              objectives of the present project are as follows: (i) to reexamine the
              mathematical foundations and properties of several theoretical constructs which
              have been proposed by material scientists for describing microtexture in
              various degrees of detail and sophistication; (ii) to delineate the effects of
              microtexture on the mechanical anisotropy of sheet metals in forming
              operations; (iii) to study the effects of microtexture on the acoustoelastic
              behavior of stressed polycrystals; (iv) to develop further an earlier study
              that concerns using the dispersion of Rayleigh waves for the nondestructive
              inspection of surface layer of residual stress, which is imparted on critical
              components of aircraft engines to enhance their high-cycle fatigue
              performance.
