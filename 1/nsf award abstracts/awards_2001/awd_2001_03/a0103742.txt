              Performance Computing

The objective of this proposal is to develop new
              methods that allows runtime performance optimization by an enhanced monitoring,
              resource modeling, evaluation and remapping of the application at runtime,
              depending on runtime resources and application performance.  The specific
              approaches to be pursued include application algorithm adaptation, run-time
              software optimization, system configuration selection and tuning reconfigurable
              OS services.
