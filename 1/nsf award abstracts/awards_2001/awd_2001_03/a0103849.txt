The Principal
              Investigator will consider a variety of problems concerning the Whitham
              equations, which describe the macrostructure of nonlinear dispersive
              oscillations.  In particular, the Principal Investigator will study (1)
              multiphase Whitham equations in one spatial dimension, and (2) Whitham
              equations in several spatial dimensions.  The primary interest of the first
              project is in the interaction of single-phase oscillations and generation and
              propagation of double and higher phase oscillations.  The basic goal of the
              second project is to understand how the zero phase Whitham solution develops
              singularities in several dimensional space.  The proposed methods will be both
              analytical and computational.  

Results of this project will have broad
              impact in interdisciplinary work.  The multiphase Whitham equations in one
              spatial variable play an essential role in both zero dispersion limit and
              modulation theories of nonlinear dispersive oscillations.  They also have
              applications in the transmission of pulses in optical fibers.  The Whitham
              equations in several spatial dimensions are intrinsically connected to
              Landau-Ginzburg models in topological field theory and the Seiberg-Witten
              solution in supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory.
