              Software: A Computer System Design Hierarchy for Simulation

Computer system
              design requires reasoning about the interaction of software with the underlying
              models of hardware resources without limiting such models to single system
              views.  Computer system elements and their interactions are not purely
              software-functional or purely hardware-structural-they have properties of both.
               A challenge in computer system design is to define the elements and the means
              of resolving their interactions, so that software interacting with underlying
              hardware resources can be modeled flexibly; alternate designs, ones with
              different numbers and types of processors, network interconnections, and/or
              software schedulers, may be easily considered.
