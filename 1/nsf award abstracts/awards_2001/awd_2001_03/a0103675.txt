CISE Postdoctoral
              Associates in Experimental Computer Science: An Interconnection Network
              Architecture for Petaflops Computing

Research in high-performance computer
              systems is proposed that will expand the one-dimensional prototype Simultaneous
              Optical Multiprocessor Exchange Bus (SOME-Bus) interconnection network into a
              two-dimensional architecture.  Recent work on the SOME-Bus over the past few
              years has raised several important issues (e.g., network interface design,
              network management, programming, applications and performance) that remain open
              and challenging as they relate to the potential two-dimensional bus.  The
              experimental and theoretical work of the postdoctoral research associate will
              contribute to multidisciplinary research in computer architecture, performance
              analysis, optoelectronic devices, and VLSI design.  The associate's research
              training will be enhanced by interactions with other nearby academic and
              industry groups working on similar high-performance architectures, and limited
              contributions to graduate student projects and courses in computer
              architecture.
