              Microarray Experiment Management System

The objective of this proposal is to
              develop systems software relating to the management of microarray experiments
              for studying hundreds of genes in given organism simultaneously.  This is a
              multidisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists who will perform
              the computer science research part of this project and will develop the
              computer systems software, and biologist who will use the microarray experiment
              as a driving case for the systems software to be developed under the project,
              and then they will be the users of the developed management infrastructure.
