Abstract    :
              The 2001 Aspen Winter Physics Conference will devote one week, February 4-10,
              2001 to gravitational waves and their detection.  The winter series began in
              1985 and the first gravitational wave session was held in 1995.  This
              conference has grown to be one of the most important for the gravitational wave
              community.  Experimental and theoretical results and plans for the future will
              be discussed with an emphasis on recent progress in building and operating
              several gravity wave interferometers in the US, Europe and Japan.
