The research
              focuses on new complex analytic methods exploiting Borel-Laplace duality to
              investigate regular and singular properties of solutions to certain classes of
              nonlinear partial differential equations and integro-differential equations in
              the complex plane. Problems to be studied include equations arising in physical
              applications that at some critical value of a parameter are either ill-posed in
              the real domain or are structurally unstable. The methods enable control over
              sensitive dependence close to a critical point in the parameter space.  
              

Many phenomena in nature are modeled by equations that depend sensitively
              on parameters. Such equations arise in descriptions of fluid mechanics, crystal
              growth and pattern formation. The underlying sensitivity can make such problems
              difficult to tackle using computer simulations. It is important to develop
              theoretical tools based on mathematical analysis to allow precise understanding
              of such phenomena, and our research is geared towards this goal.
