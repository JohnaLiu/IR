              Research: An OpenMP Environment for Wide-Area Network Computing

The
              objective of this proposal is to develop a new programming system that will
              close the gap that exists between programming SMPs and networked computer
              clusters, by using the emerging standard (OpenMP) for SMPs and develop compiler
              and runtime support that will enable using OpenMP on distributed platforms with
              optimized performance.  The proposed programming system will make it possible
              to program the Grid and networked computer systems using OpenMP, the emerging
              standard for shared-memory programming.  The PI expects to attain high
              efficiency in the execution of OpenMP programs for collection of Grid-connected
              computers.  Through static and dynamic compiler techniques, we expect to
              harness the complexity and load fluctuations of the target
              environment.
