Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a University of Chicago group for its
              participation in the construction of the Pierre Auger Observatory.  The Pierre
              Auger Observatory, when completed, is intended to consist of two cosmic ray
              detectors, one presently under construction in Malargue Argentina, and the
              other eventually to be in Utah.  Each observatory will consist of an array of
              1600 particle detectors based on detecting Cherenkov light spread over 3000
              square kilometers complements with atmospheric fluorescence detectors.  The
              arrangement is optimized to detect with maximum efficiency showers initiated by
              primary cosmic rays with energy greater than 1019 electron volts.

The
              southern observatory is being built by a consortium of eighteen nations.  The
              US contribution to the southern $50 million construction project is $7.5
              million coming equally from the NSF (PHY-9979239) and the DOE, with an
              additional $2 million in project support from Fermilab.  At the present time an
              engineering array of 40 surface particle detectors and two fluorescence
              detectors is nearing completion.  This is necessary in order to verify the
              entire design including the individual detectors, solar power, wireless
              communications, and GPS timing.

The Chicago group has participated in many
              aspects of the project.  The PI is the spokesman for the entire project, and is
              the PI for the US construction award (9979239) and its DOE counterpart.  He has
              been responsible for the scientific direction of the project.  Ken Gibbs has
              directed the survey for the engineering array, is developing plans for the
              survey and installation of the full array, and installation of the weather
              monitoring stations.  Brian Fick has developed the weather monitors and is task
              leader for development of the hybrid software, which combines data from the
              surface and fluorescence detectors.  Paul Sommers is the task leader for the
              fluorescence detectors.
