Abstract    :
              This project will utilize the data from the AMPTE/CCE satellite to do a
              statistical analysis of the decay of the Earth's ring current after magnetic
              storms.  The decay of the ring current due to charge exchange will be compared
              with global ring current decay rates estimated from the Dst index.  The Polar
              Cap (PC) index will be used to estimate the rate of continued injection of ions
              into the ring current.
