This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019. 
              The goal of this proposal is to explore a novel method for etching copper
              nano-lines at room temperature, which is crucial for the fabrication of future
              nano-devices and circuits. The PI plans to study the key step in the process,
              i.e., a unique anisotropic plasma-copper reaction, in the nano-scale
              region.

This is an experimental research project. The PI is going to
              investigate a number of issues in the nano-line definition process, such as the
              critical dimension control, profile, sidewall surface, and residue formation,
              through fundamental studies of plasma-copper surface reaction, solid-state
              reactant transport and copper-halide reactions. This research involves the
              microstructure of the copper material, plasma chemistry, and directional
              solid-state reaction mechanisms. In addition to plasma process
              characterization, he will make extensive use of Transmission Electron
              Microscopy (TFM) as well as other thin-film analytical methods to probe the
              plasma-copper reaction phenomenon at the nano-scale.

The plasma reaction
              will he carried out in the principal investigator's (P1's) Thin Film
              Microelectronic Research Laboratory. All experiments will employ a simple
              parallel-plate reactive ion etching reactor with a 13.56 MHz RF generator. The
              nano-line pattern, e.g., sub-100 nm, will be prepared in the NSF National
              Nanofabrication Users Network (NNUN) facility located in the Pennsylvania State
              University using c-beam lithography. The industry sponsor AMD agrees to support
              this project by supplying thin film characterization service, technical
              consulting, and 6-inch wafers.
