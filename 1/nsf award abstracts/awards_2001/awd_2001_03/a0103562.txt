Abstract    :
              This Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Teams (NIRT) project will address the
              common problem of large pressure drops in microfluidics by nano-engineering
              novel channel surfaces and controlling their surface properties.  The
              consequences are expected to be both dramatic and far-reaching. The research
              project is to develop a nano-engineered surface to drastically reduce viscous
              drag.  Despite the explosive growth in microfluidics, as represented by such
              high-profile applications as biochips and lab-on-a-chip, this fundamental
              problem associated with miniaturization remains unsolved: the disproportional
              increase in the relative pressure drop and the power consumption as devices are
              reduced in size. Due to the severe retardation of velocity at the surface,
              transport of liquids through long, nano/microscale channels encounter to high
              losses to be practical.  Fabrication of these surfaces will be developed by
              integrating the rich arsenal of MEMS and Nano-technologies with the extensive
              knowledge of surface and biomaterial sciences, based upon the specialized
              expertise of the four principal investigators.  Following development and
              characterization of the novel surfaces, an electrically re-configurable
              bioreactor chip will be developed as a capstone device, which further promotes
              synergistic integration among the team members as well as public awareness.
              

Fusion of the traditionally disjoint areas in this research - mechanical
              engineering and chemistry - start from students, who will take a set of formal
              courses developed and cross-offered between two schools for nanoscale science
              and engineering.  The students continue to develop their interdisciplinary mind
              from monthly team meetings and weekly task meetings for research.
