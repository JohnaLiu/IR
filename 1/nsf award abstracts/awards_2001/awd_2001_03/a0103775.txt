Abstract    :
              This collaborative research project with Jerry Harrington, Pennsylvania State
              University, University Park, will develop and test a radiation-transfer model
              for snow photochemistry.  The model will help quantify the extent of
              photochemical processing of trace compounds within snow and will help in
              interpreting ice core climate records and understanding atmospheric chemistry
              in snow-covered regions.  The project includes a laboratory-based program of
              experiments to quantify absorption spectra and quantum yields.  Experimental
              measurements of photolysis rates for bromoform, a possible precursor of "active
              bromine" in a proposed mechanism of Arctic boundary-layer ozone depletion, and
              other trace compounds in snow interstitial spaces will be made in a novel snow
              photolysis chamber.
