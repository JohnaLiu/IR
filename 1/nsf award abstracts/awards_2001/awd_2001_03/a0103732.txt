The goal of the James Madison University (JMU) UMEB is to
              recruit, mentor and train minority students to become productive scientists
              through "hands-on" research experiences.  The program will be built on existing
              partnerships with Blue Ridge Community College (BRCC) and Northern Virginia
              Community College (NVCC).  Students recruited from the participating
              institutions will progress from performing experiments proposed by a JMU
              faculty mentor to designing their own workable experiments to solve specific
              environmental problems in the Shenandoah Valley.

 Students and two community
              college faculty members will be assigned to a laboratory during the residential
              summer program.  In addition, faculty and participants will take part in
              seminars presented by scientists, weekly group research meetings, journal
              clubs, workshops in scientific writing, career development and graduate school
              admission process and field trips to selected sites. The summer program will
              end with a research symposium, where students will present their research in
              oral and poster formats.  During the academic year, students in the
              Harrisonburg area will continue their research and seminars will be held
              through videoconferencing with NVCC participants. The program will provide a
              supportive network that will develop skills needed to succeed as environmental
              scientists.
