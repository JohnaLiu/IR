This research
              addresses behavior of solutions to the 
mathematical equations of capillarity
              theory.  The 
equations will be studied in their full nonlinear 
generality,
              using procedures deriving from the intrinsic 
structure of the physical
              problems.  These procedures 
have turned out to interact in a natural way with
              newly 
developed methods of geometric measure theory, which were 
developed
              initially for the special case of minimal 
surfaces in other contexts.  In a
              number of cases of 
interest, striking and unusual behavior of solutions was
              
uncovered in this way.  Our investigations will continue 
in directions that
              have already led to discoveries of 
discontinuous dependence on boundary data,
              symmetry 
breaking, failure of existence under physical conditions, 
failure
              of uniqueness under conditions for which 
solutions exist, and discontinuous
              reversal of comparison 
relations.

Capillary interfaces play an important
              role in many 
practical situations, notably in reduced gravity or in
              
configurations for which physical length scales are very 
small. 
              Capillarity is an essential concept for 
describing situations in which
              substances are in contact 
at surface interfaces and do not mix.  A precise
              
understanding of the mathematical properties of solutions 
of the
              capillarity equations will provide valuable 
insight for resolving such
              matters as how to design fuel 
tanks on an orbiting spacecraft so that the
              fuel will be 
accessibly located, predicting where oil or water resides 
in
              underground pore spaces of rocks, or determining the 
manner in which the
              faces of microelectronic components 
will become partially covered when they
              are dipped in a 
coating bath.  The work under consideration is of
              
particular relevance for predicting unexpected behavior 
of liquids in these
              and in other applications.
