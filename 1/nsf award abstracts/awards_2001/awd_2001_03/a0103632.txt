The research will develop asymptotic
              methods to solve 
nonlinear singularly perturbed boundary value problems 
for
              both ordinary and partial differential equations.  A 
special emphasis will be
              the systematic development of 
renormalization methods, which theoretical
              physicists 
have  proposed as a unified tool for asymptotic analysis. 
              
Another will be continued investigation of metastable 
dynamics for
              algebraic, as well as exponential, 
asymptotics. The problems are related
              since they both 
deal with long-time asymptotics and the classical method 
of
              multiple scales.

Asymptotic methods, like computation, provide an
              
important way to find approximate solutions to nonlinear 
problems arising
              in significant applications.  This work 
seeks to further develop such
              analytical techniques and 
to apply them in engineering and the sciences.
