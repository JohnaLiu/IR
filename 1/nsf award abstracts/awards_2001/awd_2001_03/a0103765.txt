Abstract    :
              The proposer will study periods of irregular connections and Reimann Roch type
              problems for Gauss-Manin connections associated to irregular connections.  The
              focus will be on proving a conjectured formula for the determinant of the
              Gauss-Manin connection.  He will study applications of this formula to epsilon
              factors in arithmetic and to the theory of co-adjoint orbits in representation
              theory and symplectic geometry.  At the same time, the proposer will
              investigate whether periods of irregular connections can be subsumed in a
              theory of contravariant motives for singular varieties.

Certain numbers like
              pi and e play a central role in mathematics. In some cases, these numbers are
              "periods".  Essentially, they arise where geometry meets number theory.  Other
              such numbers (irregular periods) seem to be fundamentally non-geometric and
              non-number theoretic in nature. This proposal is an attempt to better
              understand these irregular periods. The key idea is the observation of a
              Japanese mathematician, Terasoma, that even though one has no geometric
              construction of these irregular periods, they are known in some cases to
              satisfy formulae which are analogous to the formulae satisfied by other objects
              (called epsilon factors) arising in number theoretic algebraic geometry.
