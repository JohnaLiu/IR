This
              proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation "Nanoscale Science and
              Engineering" (NSF 00-119).  The objective of this proposal is to design
              dendrimer-stabilized nanoparticles of transition metals, bimetallic alloys, and
              transition metal oxides for use in heterogeneous catalysis.  Dendrimers, used
              as chemical templates and nanoparticle stabilizers, provide an opportunity for
              precise control of the size, composition, and arrangement of atoms in catalytic
              nanoparticles, as well as a means for self-assembly and immobilization of
              nanoparticles in ordered two-dimensional and three-dimensional arrays on
              surfaces.  Catalyst activity, selectivity, and lifetime will be improved by
              exploiting phenomena unique to catalytic structures designed and fabricated on
              the nanoscale.  Research and educational activities include theoretical design,
              molecular modeling, nanoparticle synthesis, catalyst preparation and
              evaluation.  Through this multidisciplinary activity, an overall goal is to
              design the next generation of catalysts based on a rational atom-up approach. 
              Additional support will be provided to students through the three NSF-REU sites
              and through Sloan Foundation Fellowships, aimed at increasing minority
              participation.  This work has the potential to improve the rational design of
              catalysts through molecular modeling and synthesis of nanoparticles.
