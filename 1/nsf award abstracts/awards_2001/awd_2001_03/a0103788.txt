This U.S.-Mexico award will support a workshop on current
              problems in complex fluids with a particular emphasis on self-assembling
              systems.  The workshop, which will take place in Oaxaca, Mexico, July 10-14,
              2001 in conjunction with a major international meeting on statistical physics,
              STATPHYS 21, is being co-organized by Dr. Charles M. Knobler, UCLA and Dr.
              Carmen Varea, of the Institute of Physics of the National Autonomous University
              of Mexico (UNAM), and colleagues at UNAM and at the Autonomous University of
              San Luis Potosi.  This activity is being jointly supported between the Division
              of International Programs and the Chemistry Division of NSF.

The workshop
              will discuss current developments in the field of self-assembling systems and
              related areas and help to stimulate joint research initiatives between the US
              and Mexican research communities.  The area of complex fluids is a
              multidisciplinary research area that has attracted increased attention over the
              past decade due to a variety of technological applications as well as
              connections to nanoscale and biomimetic materials. A variety of materials fall
              under this category, sharing common properties useful in attempts to describe
              and characterize them.
