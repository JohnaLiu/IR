Abstract    :
              This award will fund young participants at the Second Duke Mathematical
              Journal/International Mathematics Research Notices (DMJ/IMRN) Conference, which
              will take place at Duke University on April 27 to 29, 2001. For the purposes of
              this Conference, a young mathematician is one who is just about to graduate or
              is up to seven years beyond the doctorate. 

The Conference will focus on
              areas covered by the two journals. The eight speakers will be internationally
              renowned younger mathematicians. The goal of the Conference is to bring
              together young mathematicians to help them learn about recent major
              developments in areas near their own, and also to help broaden their interests
              and perspective (which should be important in their development as
              mathematicians).
