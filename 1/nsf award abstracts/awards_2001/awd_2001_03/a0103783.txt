Abstract    :
              
The primary objective of this project is a comprehensive inventory of the
              approximately 6,000 vascular plant species of Pakistan. This will be
              accomplished primarily by completion of the remaining family-level treatments
              of the published Flora of Pakistan, and all funds granted for this project are
              directed toward preparation of those treatments by Pakistani botanists and
              their international collaborators, including Pakistan's senior botanist, Dr.
              Syed Ali, who is co-principal investigator. Treatments of 203 families are
              already in print, leaving only 10 to be published. However, these include large
              families for the region such as Asteraceae, Cyperaceae, and Scrophulariaceae,
              and include an estimated 25% of all the species. Work supported with other
              funding will assemble the published information in a web-accessible relational
              database of all plant species in Pakistan. The ultimate goal of the project is
              a complete modern flora of a large but relatively poorly studied region of
              South Asia, and the first complete floristic database for the
              region.
Completion of the Flora of Pakistan is an essential first step to
              understanding, managing, and preserving the biodiversity of Pakistan.
              Information from the project will provide scientists and government officials
              with critical data for resource management, including selection of areas for
              conservation priority and of plants for use in restorations for erosion control
              and reforestation.
