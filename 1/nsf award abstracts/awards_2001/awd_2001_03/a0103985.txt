The Principle Investigator proposes to focus on three
              
central problems in set-theoretic topology which involve 
basic countable
              convergence issues and set-theoretic 
independence results. The first
              question, due to Efimov, 
is to determine if it is consistent that any compact
              
space that does not contain a converging sequence will 
contain the
              Stone-Cech compactification of the integers. 
The second, due to Bashkirov, is
              to determine if there 
can be a countable bound on the sequential order of a
              compact sequential space. This problem can, in some ways, be viewed 
as a very
              interesting strengthening of the recently resolved Moore-Mrowka problem. The
              third is to continue a systematic 
study of the Stone-Cech remainder of the
              reals analogous to 
that which has long been conducted for the remainder of
              the 
integers. There appears to be many obstructions to progess 
caused by
              the additional complexity imposed by the connectedness property.

General
              questions of the existence of converging sequences 
and the extent to which
              converging sequences fully determine 
the topological structure arise
              frequently in a variety of 
settings. These questions are particularly
              meaningful in the 
context of compact subsets of function spaces
              (natural
informative topologies on sets of real-valued functions). 
The
              investigator is continuing to pursue lines of investigation 
that have
              stimulated intensive interaction between the fields 
of general topology and
              set-theory for de
