              ABSTRACT 0103792

This project proposes to develop statistical methods useful
              for the analysis of correlated, non-normally distributed data.  Such data
              arises commonly in clinical trials, in familial genetic studies, in ecological
              studies, and in a variety of other contexts when binary or count data is
              gathered on the same subject, on the same family, at the same site, or from the
              plot of land.  Failure to account for correlations in the analysis of such data
              can readily lead to misleading conclusions.

The methods will be based on
              deriving unbiased estimating equations for both variance components and
              regression parameters within the context of a generalized linear mixed model. 
              The goal is to derive methods of wide utility with good small sample
              performance.  The performance of the newly developed methods will be assessed
              on their own with regard to ease of computation, lack of bias, smallness of
              mean square error, the ease with which accurate standard errors can be
              computed, and the ease of calculating accurate confidence intervals and
              performing hypothesis tests.  The methods will also be compared to extant
              methods (maximum likelihood, higher order Laplace approximations, penalized
              quasi-likelihood and generalized estimating equations) using the same criteria.
