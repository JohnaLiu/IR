The project will focus on the applications of the proposer's
              new 
equivariant theory of moving frames for general Lie group actions.
              
Particular emphasis will be in three key applied directions: analysis and
              
applications of invariant variational problems and invariant partial
              
differential equations in geometry and physics, the design of
              symmetry-
preserving numerical algorithms for approximating differential
              invariants 
and integrating invariant differential equations, and object
              recognition and 
symmetry detection in computer vision based on differential
              invariant and 
noise-resistant joint invariant signatures. The project will
              include further 
development of the underlying moving frame theory,
              particularly in the 
case of infinite-dimensional Lie pseudo-groups, and the
              formulation of a 
proper geometrical foundation for multivariate numerical
              approximation 
and interpolation.

The recognition and exploitation symmetry
              is an essential tool in modern 
mathematics and its applications.  This
              project will continue to develop a 
new, powerful geometric approach, known as
              moving frames, to systems 
that have continuous symmetry.  The modern moving
              frame theory 
developed by the PI has already witnessed a remarkable range of
              new 
applications, including computer vision, for object recognition and
              
symmetry detection, a geometric approach to classical algebra and 
invariant
              theory, as well as the design of numerical integration schemes 
that preserve
              the underlying symmetry of the problem to be solved.  The 
combination of
              analytical, geometrical, and numerical advances, coupled 
with practical
              applications has proved to be a particularly potent blend of 
theory and
              practical tools. This research project will continue the rapid 
development
              and application of the moving frame method, concentrating 
on theoretical
              developments tied to applications in computer vision, in 
geometry and
              physics, and in symmetry-based numerical integration 
methods
