NGS:
              Powerful Software for Power Constrained Systems

The objective of this
              proposal is to develop new monitoring and simulation tools for resource
              monitoring at runtime, and compiler assisted optimization to enable execution
              under energy evaluation and optimization conditions.  The proposal will
              implement these methods into an integrated framework to evaluate optimizations
              at the application, compiler and operating system levels.  This project will
              specifically focus on a spatial database application called PocketGIS, an
              important mobile application, to explore these issues.
