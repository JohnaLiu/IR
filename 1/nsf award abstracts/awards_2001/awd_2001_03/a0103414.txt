              Abstract

This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019. A Forster
              transfer microscope (FTM) will be developed to allow in vivo imaging of living
              cells with 5 nm resolution. The unprecedented resolution will be achieved
              through non-radiative Forster energy transfer between a scanning probe
              containing a silicon nanoparticle and a sample tagged with dye molecules.  The
              FTM will exploit two recent developments in nanotechnology: (i) the discovery,
              at the University of Illinois, of a technique for fabricating 1 nm silicon
              nanoparticles with excellent size uniformity and fluorescence efficiency, and
              (ii) the development of a combined atomic force microscope / near-field
              scanning optical microscope (AF-NSOM) with 50 nm optical resolution and 1 nm
              height resolution.

The FTM will be used to solve a long-standing question
              about how hormones and drugs interact with epithelial membranes: "Is ion
              transport  modulated by movement of ion channels to and from the apical
              membrane (vesical trafficking), or by changes in their activation state?"  As
              cultured epithelial membranes become a more widely used biomaterial, e.g. skin
              for burn victims, an understanding of cell dynamics on the 100 nm scale and
              below will be invaluable.
