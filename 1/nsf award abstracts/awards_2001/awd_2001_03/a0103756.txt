The goal of this
              project is to develop the tools needed for performance-directed integrated
              design and control of complex applications running on distributed computational
              systems.  Its target computational systems are complex, incorporating the
              difficult heterogeneity, latency, and adaptive properties of computational
              grids.  Its target applications are at the cutting edge of computational
              science: very large, complex applications with adaptive characteristics that do
              not allow their optimal system configurations or computational requirements to
              be estimated prior to run time.  Each application will be viewed as a
              composition of components, with a formal, high fidelity model of performance to
              be designed for each component.  The approach is to use model-based adaptive
              run-time control, based on these composed performance models, to control the
              execution of the application to meet specified performance goals.  The control
              strategy will make real-time changes to parameters that modify the behavior of
              both application and computational platform.
