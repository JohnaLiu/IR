Abstract    :
               Inventory of the Ferns and Fern Allies of Hawaii

In Hawaii ferns and fern
              allies make up approximately one-sixth of the total native vascular flora and
              comprise a very important element of the vegetation.  Unfortunately, there is
              no modern inventory of these plants.  Many are poorly known and understood, and
              many are rare, threatened, or endangered.  The objective of this project is to
              complete and publish a manual containing a description and key to
              identification of the species, varieties, and hybrids of all the ferns and fern
              allies of Hawaii.  The manual will complement the two-volume "Manual of the
              Flowering Plants of Hawaii" by W. L. Wagner (no relation), D. R. Herbst, and S.
              H. Sohmer (1990).  Descriptions of 70 percent of the species have been
              completed with support of two previous NSF grants, but problems exist in
              determining the names and relationships of many of the remaining taxa.

Field
              surveys in Hawaii will be made and herbarium collections will be studied,
              especially at the Bishop Museum, Honolulu.  Volunteer botanists in Hawaii have
              already augmented our knowledge of existing species, finding some that were
              thought to be extinct.  Explorations by them in seemingly inaccessible
              locations will contribute substantially to the completion of the manual. 
              Photocopies of fresh specimens collected in the
field will be used for
              illustrations in the manual.  Duplicate specimens will be distributed to
              herbaria throughout the world.  A database for Hawaiian ferns will be
              developed.
	
The Hawaiian ferns suggests taxonomic problems beyond the scope
              of the manual.  The islands are geographically the most isolated in the world,
              and, without land bridges to the continents, the ferns have adapted and evolved
              in diverse ways.  A complete manual of the ferns and fern allies will encourage
              and enable botanists to study questions of their origin and evolution.  Hawaii
              has many naturalists and non-professional botanists who, for years, have been
              asking for a manual with which to identify this important element of the
              vegetation, before the invasion of exotic species and encroaching development
              eliminate more of this flora.
