Abstract    :
              Systematics and Biogeography of the Herpetofauna of Papua New Guinea

New
              Guinea, the world's largest and highest tropical island, has more than 530
              species of  
amphibians and reptiles, about 5% of the world total.  However,
              much of New Guinea remains poorly known and it is estimated that as many as 200
              species remain unknown to science.  This project focuses on inventorying
              unexplored regions of Papua New Guinea, a country that occupies the eastern
              half of the island of New Guinea as well as associated archipelagos to the
              north.  

The principal investigators will conduct intensive inventories of
              amphibians and reptiles of ten major unstudied areas, provide logistical
              support for concordant studies of mammals, land snails, scorpions, aquatic
              insects and other groups, train at least five Papua New Guinea citizens as
              parataxonomists, and supervise two Papua New Guinea graduate students in
              research being done as requirements for Master's Degrees.  

This study will
              result in the description of new species, a much better understanding of the
              fauna (particularly its evolution and biogeography), compilation of a
              comprehensive spatial database on the distribution of species, and publication
              of illustrated field guides with keys.  It also will provide essential
              information for conservation planning, and will help advance and refine
              biodiversity predictive modeling methodology (BIORAP) that uses locality
              information from museum specimen collections to identify priority areas for
              conservation.
