Abstract    :
              The 43rd Annual Maize Genetics Conference is being held March 15-18, 2001 in
              Lake Geneva, WI.  The meeting offers members of the Maize Genetics community
              the opportunity to present and discuss their most recent research results.  A
              wide range of topics are covered, ranging from classical to molecular genetics.
               The 43rd Annual meeting features 45 minute talks by four invited speakers, 15
              minute talks given by individual participants, two poster sessions, and two
              workshops.  The invited speakers are: Alice Barkan, University of Oregon; Kelly
              Dawe, University of Georgia; June Nasrallah, Cornell University; and Laurie
              Smith, University of California-San Diego. The workshops focus on two timely
              topics: Comparative Genomics of Maize and Rice and Bioinformatics.  This award
              provides partial support toward student participation in the conference.  The
              Maize Genetics meeting provides an outstanding opportunity for graduate
              students to meet and interact with scientists in the field, to discuss their
              research ideas as talks or posters, and to begin to establish the scientific
              networks that will prove invaluable throughout their careers.
