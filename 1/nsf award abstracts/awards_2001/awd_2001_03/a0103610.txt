NGS:  Collaborative Research: An
              OpenMP Environment for Wide-Area Network Computing

The objective of this
              proposal is to develop a new programming system that will close the gap that
              exists between programming SMPs and networked computer clusters, by using the
              emerging standard (OpenMP) for SMPs and develop compiler and runtime support
              that will enable using OpenMP on distributed platforms with optimized
              performance.  The proposed programming system will make it possible to program
              the Grid and networked computer systems using OpenMP, the emerging standard for
              shared-memory programming.  The PI expects to attain high efficiency in the
              execution of OpenMP programs for collection of Grid-connected computers. 
              Through static and dynamic compiler techniques, we expect to harness the
              complexity and load fluctuations of the target environment.
