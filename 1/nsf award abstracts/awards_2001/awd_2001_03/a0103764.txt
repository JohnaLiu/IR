The goal
              of this project is to develop the tools needed for performance-directed
              integrated design and control of complex applications running on distributed
              computational systems.  Its target computational systems are complex,
              incorporating the difficult heterogeneity, latency, and adaptive properties of
              computational grids.  Its target applications are at the cutting edge of
              computational science: very large, complex applications with adaptive
              characteristics that do not allow their optimal system configurations or
              computational requirements to be estimated prior to run time.  Each application
              will be viewed as a composition of components, with a formal, high fidelity
              model of performance to be designed for each component.  The approach is to use
              model-based adaptive run-time control, based on these composed performance
              models, to control the execution of the application to meet specified
              performance goals.  The control strategy will make real-time changes to
              parameters that modify the behavior of both application and computational
              platform.
