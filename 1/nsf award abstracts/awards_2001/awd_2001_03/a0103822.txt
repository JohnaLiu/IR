     The investigator and his colleague develop
              geometric,
dynamical systems tools for analyzing
              biophysical,
conductance-based models for a broad class of neuronal
              networks.
These systems arise in numerous applications including
              motor
activity, sensory processing and learning.  They also
              develop
computational models for the generation of sleep rhythms,
epilepsy
              and parkinsonian tremor.  The investigators also
construct and refine a
              mathematical and computational model for
electrical activity in the
              subthalamic nucleus and external
segment of the globus pallidus.  These are
              two nuclei in the
basal ganglia, a part of the brain involved in motor
              activity.
Dysfunction of the basal ganglia is associated with
              movement
disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.
The
              model is used to test hypotheses on the role of the basal
ganglia in both
              normal and pathological movement.  Numerous
experiments have demonstrated that
              neurons within the basal
ganglia display a rich variety of dynamic behavior;
              moreover,
patterns of neuronal activity, both spatial and temporal,
              are
different between a normal and a pathological state.  The
investigators
              characterize the possible patterns of neuronal
activity that arise in the
              model and determine how these patterns
change with respect to modulations of
              network parameters and
structure.  A long term goal is to develop a model
              realistic
enough so that it can shed light upon the key parameters
              and
mechanisms responsible for the generation and modulation of
observed
              activity patterns.
     A mathematical theory for the analysis of neuronal
              dynamics
helps illuminate the role played by various components of a model
in
              generating a particular population rhythm.  These components
may correspond to
              some intrinsic property of individual cells, or
to some network property such
              as the strength and type of
synaptic coupling or the probability that two
              cells communicate
with each other.  Clarification of the mechanisms
              underlying
different activity patterns may lead to a classification of
              all
possible rhythms that can emerge from a given network, and enable
us to
              determine how complicated a model should be in order to
display some observed
              behavior.  It also helps predict
transitions of the network behavior as
              parameters in the model
are varied.  The investigators develop models for
              neuronal
dynamics, and in particular of electrical activity in
              the
subthalamic nucleus and external segment of the globus pallidus.
These
              are two nuclei in the basal ganglia, a part of the brain
involved in motor
              activity.  Dysfunction of the basal ganglia is
associated with movement
              disorders such as Parkinson's disease
and Huntington's disease.  The model is
              used to test hypotheses
on the role of the basal ganglia in both normal and
              pathological
movement.  Such models may help illuminate both
              fundamental
neuroscience questions and clinical issues about how the
              brain
and central nervous system work.
