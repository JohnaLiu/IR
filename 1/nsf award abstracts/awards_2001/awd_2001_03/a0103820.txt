Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses one simple question: how can we develop effective
              multi-agent systems out of the exception-prone (buggy, malicious, or simply
              "dumb") agents and infrastructures we can expect to encounter in open system
              contexts? This problem will be addressed by developing technologies that can
              determine, at run time, what exceptions can occur, as well as what exception
              detection and resolution strategies are appropriate, for a dynamically changing
              agent population and system environment. This work
will build on two key
              ideas: (1) it is possible to identify highly reusable domain-independent
              exception handling expertise, and (2) this expertise can be instantiated in the
              form of distinct exception handling services that outsource exception handling
              from the agents, requiring only that they adhere to some relatively simple
              guidelines. The potential impact of this work will include (1) enabling the
              creation of multi-agent systems that can function effectively in open contexts,
              while (2) reducing the burden on agent developers by obviating the need to
              create agents with sophisticated exception handling capabilities.
