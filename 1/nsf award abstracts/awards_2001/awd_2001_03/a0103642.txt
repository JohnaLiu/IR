CISE NGS: Cache
              Efficient and Parallel Bidiagonalization

Cache efficient reduction to
              bidiagonal form allows a significant speedup in computation of the singular
              value decomposition (SVD) for rectangular matrices.  The SVD provides the most
              standard and stable means of solving least square problems and of providing low
              rank approximations (allowing compressions of data stored in matrix form).  As
              such it is used constantly by researchers around the nation and the
              world.

This proposal will result in speedups in the standard LAPACK
              implementation and also in the parallel computation package SCALAPACK.    The
              work will also extend to the parallel case with a view for inclusion in
              SCALPACK.  In the parallel case the optimizer must take into account not only
              details of the local computer architecture and memory hierarchy but also
              communication among the processors.
