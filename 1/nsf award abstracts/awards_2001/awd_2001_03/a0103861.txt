Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to carry out experimental and numerical investigations of flow
              instabilities induced by cavitation as often found in hydraulic machinery, and
              in flows around hydrofoils and propellers.  Attention will be paid in the
              following four ares: (1)  the formation of cloud cavitation and its effect on
              the wake structure of hydrofoils, (2) detailed study of erosion mechanisms
              caused by the collapse of such cavities, (3) comparative study of the acoustics
              of cloud and bubble cavitation, and (4) analysis of the periodic oscillations
              of the reentrant jet and their scaling.  Experiments and numerical simulations
              will be carried out in an interactive manner to enhance the progress in both
              endeavors.
