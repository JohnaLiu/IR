This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019.  As the
              area of microfabricated biochemical instrumentation continues to grow,
              increasingly sophisticated devices are necessary.  Fluid flows in the great
              majority of current microfluidic devices are electrically driven, especially
              for those involved in charge-based separations of biological molecules such as
              DNA, RNA, and proteins.  This electrically driven flow offers numerous
              advantages over micromachined pressure-driven pumps, including ease of
              fabrication and operation, simplicity of integration with other functional
              elements, and the absence of moving parts.  However, this electrical means of
              pumping suffers from the lack of simultaneous control over fluid flow in
              multiple interconnected channels, and the inability to perform spatial- or
              time-controlled modification of flow rate and direction.

The realization of
              true lab-on-a-chip technology, in which the capability of desktop bioanalytical
              tools is replicated in a credit card sized package, will require precise flow
              control and metering in complex networks of interconnected microfluidic
              channels between mixers, reactors, reservoirs, separators, sensors, and related
              components.  To this end, we propose to create an integrated system for fluid
              control in this miniaturized format.  A novel microfluidic element, a
              microfluidic multiplexer, can overcome the limitations mentioned above for
              ordinary electrically driven fluid flow.  This is accomplished by directly
              controlling the electrical properties at the inner surface of the microfluidic
              channels through the application of a radial, external electric field.  The
              microfluidic multiplexer, which allows on-device flow control in complex
              microfluidic networks, will serve as the key component in a range of
              microfabricated devices for performing unique bioseparations and bioanalyses.
