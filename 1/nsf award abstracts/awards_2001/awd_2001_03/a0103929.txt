Abstract    :
              	Essential properties of multidimensional probability distributions often
              include geometric and analytic characteristics related to global behavior of
              smooth functionals in a growing number of variables. This research focuses on
              various concentration phenomena for different classes of probability measures
              in spaces of high dimension. The classes of product measures, uniform
              distributions over convex bodies, or logarithmically concave measures are good
              examples with a number of challenging problems. The study of the role of the
              dimension as the main parameter of a distribution is placed in the center of
              the research.
	Many important properties of stochastic processes postulate
              possible behavior of sample trajectories and often refer to distributions of
              various functionals. Obtaining essential information on the process requires
              the study of multidimensional distributions and leads to deep mathematical
              problems which are also interesting in themselves from the point view of the
              natural development of mathematical sciences. This research focuses on the
              study of global properties of stochastic processes and on how they relate to
              different objects from analysis, geometry and statistics.
