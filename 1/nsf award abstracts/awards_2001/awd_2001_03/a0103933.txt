              Science: CISE Postdoctoral Research and Training in Advanced Compiler
              Optimization

Modern processors extensively use memory hierarchies with
              multiple levels of caches in order to cope with the widening gap between
              processor and memory speeds.  As a result, the performance of programs depend
              critically on their memory access characteristics and how these are matched to
              the memory hierarchy of the processors.  While several compiler transformations
              have been proposed towards enhancing locality, even for programs with regular
              memory access patterns such as those in dense linear algebra computations, the
              best compiler-optimized codes do not match the performance of library
              implementations.

One goal of this research is to train a postdoctoral
              research associate in the area of developing compiler transformations (either
              data or computation or a combination of the two) to handle a larger class of
              programming constructs than perfect nests and regular memory accesses. 
              Initially, the associate will build on data shackling, which has been recently
              proposed as a data-centric approach to the problem of optimizing locality.  To
              accomplish this goal, the associate will be trained to design an optimization
              strategy that will integrate data shackling (a data-centric approach) and
              tiling (a control-centric approach), and implement it in a compiler and
              evaluate its effectiveness. The associate will:

1) Study a large collection
              of applications with both regular and irregular memory access patterns,
              including scientific computing codes and multimedia applications,

2) Design
              heuristics for improving the effectiveness and applicability of data shackling,
              develop methods to integrate data shackling and tiling, and implement these in
              a compiler, and

3) Perform extensive experimental evaluation of the
              techniques on several benchmarking applications.
