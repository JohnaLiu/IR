              Quality of Service in Mobile Systems

Disaster recovery after an emergency
              such as an earthquake, terrorist attack, or war may depend on mobile systems
              for communications.  Security and Quality of Service (QoS) are of utmost
              importance.  Providing security and QoS is a difficult problem in mobile
              systems because the availability of network and other resources may change as
              the mobile host fails, moves, or comes under intentional or unintentional
              attack.  Research on a technique to achieve fault-tolerant mobile node
              authentication in an efficient way is proposed for a postdoctoral research
              associate.  Such a technique would eliminate single points of failure,
              distribute loading, and enhance scalability and survivability, and make
              failures transparent to users.  A series of experiments are planned that will
              evaluate this technique under a variety of variables and lead to the
              development of new authentication and key management  techniques.  The
              associate will 1) identify guidelines for authentication between an upstream
              domain and an ingress router in a QoS enabled network, 2) evaluate various
              secure group communication and access control techniques for suitability in
              wireless communications, and 3) explore adaptability requirements when
              considering security as a QoS parameter.
