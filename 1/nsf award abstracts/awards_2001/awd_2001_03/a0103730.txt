The research
              program lies on the interface between continuum physics and the theory of
              hyperbolic systems of conservation laws.  It involves the following two
              projects:  (a) the study of the geometric structure of weak solutions to
              hyperbolic conservation laws that are merely bounded and measurable but not
              necessarily of bounded variation;  (b)  the study of the interaction between
              nonlinear hyperbolicity and damping induced by viscous or electromagnetic
              effects.

Hyperbolic conservation laws are nonlinear systems of partial
              differential equations that govern the dynamic behavior of materials with
              nonlinear elastic response, such as air, rubber etc.  Nonlinearity induces the
              development of discontinuities propagating as shock waves.  The research
              project will investigate to what extent the destabilizing action of shocks may
              be checked by damping mechanisms induced by viscous or electromagnetic
              effects.
