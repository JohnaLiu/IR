Abstract    :
              	Lichens are poorly known symbiotic organisms that occur world-wide on bark,
              rocks and soil.  Outside of the Arctic there are no comprehensive
              identification books available.  The current investigation involves a 10-year
              collaboration among over 70 scientists from 15 countries to develop a modern
              identification book for northwestern Mexico and southwestern USA, a region
              covering 600,000 square miles and designated the greater Sonoran Desert region.
               Adjacent mountains as well as the desert are included in the region.
              
	Although the collecting phase involving over a dozen major scientific
              expeditions is now concluded, analysis of specimens is still on-going.  Current
              funding will allow final analyses and development of appropriate
              classifications to go into the second and  final volume of the identification
              book (the first one is essentially complete).  In addition, current funding
              will allow development of an internet identification system based on the almost
              2000 species recognized from the region.
	The final product will include two
              books covering the 2000 species and include species descriptions, distribution
              maps, keys for identification of the species and an extensive introduction.  An
              alternative version will be available over the internet.  The treatment will
              almost 50% of the lichen species known from North America and as a consequence
              will have significance beyond the immediate geographic region covered.  Because
              lichens are well known to be sensitive to air pollution and are important
              components of many ecosystems, it is anticipated that the results will be of
              considerable interest to land managers, air pollution specialists, scientists
              and public interest groups concerned with natural ecosystems.
