Abstract for NSF proposal DMS-0103355:

In this project, the principal
              investigator investigates the geometry of
Calabi-Yau manifolds and mirror
              symmetry. First the PI plans to describe the
degeneration of Kahler-Einstein
              metrics on Calabi-Yau manifolds near the
large complex structure limit. 
              Second the principal investigator studies 
special Lagrangian submanifolds and
              deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills bundles 
on Calabi-Yau manifolds. Third, using
              Fourier transformation, Legendre transformation 
and their variations, the
              principal investigator explains the mirror duality of complex
geometry and
              symplectic geometry between mirror manifolds.


The geometry of Calabi-Yau
              manifolds is an important subject in Mathematics,
and also in Physics.
              Originated in String theory, mirror symmetry conjecture
gives a duality
              transformation of this geometry. This project is towards
uncovering this
              amazing symmetry principle.
