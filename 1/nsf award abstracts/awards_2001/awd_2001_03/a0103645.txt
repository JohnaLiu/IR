Performance Modeling
              and Programming Environments for PetaFlop Computers and the Blue Gene
              Machine

The objective of the proposal is to develop performance simulation
              capabilities to allow system level analysis and prediction of performance of
              the next generation complex PetaFlop machines that include multiple levels of
              memory hierarchy and interconnects.  The performance simulator that will be
              developed will be used to test parallel data structures and algorithms
              implemented in programming environments used in these machines, as well as
              frameworks to enable the development of applications for these machine classes.
               A number of important applications will be used to test and validate the CS
              technology advances.
