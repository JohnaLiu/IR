Nano Exploratory Research: The
              Single-Molecule DNA Transfer

The focus of this project is to investigate the
              possibility of using single molecules of DNA for molecular-based electronic
              devices.  Recent results of single-molecule DNA transistor shows a Coulomb
              Blockade Staircase and a gate-voltage dependence of the conductance enabling
              reliable and reproducible conducting DNA devices.  This project is furthering
              this work to investigate the mechanism for DNA conduction and its dependence on
              various chemical and structural parameters.  The single-molecule DNA transistor
              is being further investigated too understand the mechanism by which DNA
              conducts.  Various questions such as dependence of conductivity of DNA to
              length and sequence; differences in conductivity between single-stranded and
              doubled-stranded DNA; dependence of the conduction in DNS to salts from the
              buffer solution; where are possible scattering centers located in the DNA
              molecule?  Answers to such fundamental questions are expected to lead to a
              number of future novel molecular-scaled DNA-based electronic devices.
