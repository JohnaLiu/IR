Abstract    :
              Basic exploratory research is performed on nanoscale surface engineering through
              means of ultra-fast, pulsed laser radiation coupled with near-field scanning
              probe microscopy. A new experimental apparatus consisting of a femtosecond
              laser source coupled with a scanning AFM/STM system is used for this purpose.
              Depending on the process parameters, high-definition nanomachining and
              nanodeposition can be achieved. The effects of the laser intensity
              distribution, wavelength, and polarization are examined in relation to the
              sample/probe tip material parameters. The integrity, durability, mechanical,
              chemical and electrical structural properties of the produced nanofeatures are
              characterized by various micro-analytical techniques. The long-term objective
              is the development of functional relationships between key process parameters,
              patterning features, and material properties of the modified surfaces that will
              enable nanostructure optimization.
