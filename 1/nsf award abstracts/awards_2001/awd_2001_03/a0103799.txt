Title: Relaxation and Regularity Theory in the Calculus
              of Variations: Applications to Multiscale Problems, Thin Structures, and
              Magnetic Materials

The general objective of this project is the development
              of techniques in the calculus of variations, geometric measure theory, and in
              the regularity theory for systems of partial differential equations to address
              equilibrium and stability problems involving both bulk and surface energies,
              and where the admissible fields develop fast, multiple scale oscillations, and
              well as defect concentrations. The underlying models include singularly
              perturbed energies, multiscale homogenization, shape optimization for
              gradient-constrained functionals, and multiscale problems for dimension
              reduction.

The research activity will be motivated by contemporary issues in
              materials science and solid physics, where the contribution of mathematicians
              has already paved the way to important advances in the theoretical
              understanding of advanced materials and in high-technology performance.
              Emerging issues require state-of-the-art techniques in applied analysis, new
              ideas, and the introduction of innovative tools. The program contemplates the
              study of phase transformations (e.g. nucleation and growth of phases, dynamics
              of phase boundaries, multi-phase elasto-plastic materials), micromagnetism and
              ferromagnetism, nanostructures and thin films, optimal design of composites,
              and multiple scale problems.
