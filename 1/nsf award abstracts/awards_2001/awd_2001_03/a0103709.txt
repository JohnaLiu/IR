The PI's proposed to
              develop new innovative approaches and techniques to advance the component-based
              development ( CDB) of complex applications.  The proposed effort in developing
              advanced CBD techniques spans three dimensions: The research will enable such
              capabilities by enabling ontology-based repository, code pattern based
              component composition and tool suite for component comprehension and
              customization.  
 
Technological advances, such as rapidly increasing
              computing power and network bandwidth, are enabling advanced high-performance
              distributed applications that can significantly enhance the quality of
              education, health care, remote monitoring and control, early warning systems,
              scientific collaborations, and other high-performance distributed
              applications.
