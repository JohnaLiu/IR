Abstract    :
              This collaborative research project with William Simpson, University of Alaska,
              Fairbanks, will develop and test a radiation-transfer model for snow
              photochemistry.  The model will help quantify the extent of photochemical
              processing of trace compounds within snow and will help in interpreting ice
              core climate records and understanding atmospheric chemistry in snow-covered
              regions.  The project includes a laboratory-based program of experiments to
              quantify absorption spectra and quantum yields.  Experimental measurements of
              photolysis rates for bromoform, a possible precursor of "active bromine" in a
              proposed mechanism of Arctic boundary-layer ozone depletion, and other trace
              compounds in snow interstitial spaces will be made in a novel snow photolysis
              chamber.
