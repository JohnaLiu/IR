Abstract    :
              The proposal  outlines a program of exploring different aspects of
              low
dimensional dynamics:
combinatorial and geometric issues of holomorphic
              dynamics,
its interplay with one-dimensional real dynamics 
 (particularly in
              the rigidity and renormalization theories),
interaction with three dimensional
              hyperbolic geometry and the theory of
foliations, analytic and geometric
              aspects of two dimensional complex and
real dynamics.

The dynamical systems
              theory studies the evolution of various systems
arising in physics, biology,
              engineering etc., as well as simplified
mathematical models for those systems.
              It has been realized in the past 25
years that even one- or two- dimensional
              models can exhibit rich and
important phenomena. It has been also realized
              that the methods of complex
analysis provide powerful tools for dealing with
              these systems. The
proposal intends to explore further this branch of
              dynamics.
