Abstract    :
              This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019.   This NIRT project
              focuses on the study of charge transport in molecular systems.   An
              interdisciplinary team from physics and chemistry, working in the areas of
              nanoscale synthesis, high-precision structural characterization,
              electrochemistry, DNA chemistry, microfluidic techniques, and the use of novel
              nanoscale materials will be engaged in the effort.  There are two principal
              experimental thrusts to the work: 1) the systematic exploration of electronic
              tunneling through solvents and other small, well-characterized molecules and 2)
              a rigorous study of charge transport through DNA.   The award is jointly funded
              by the Divisions of Physics and Chemistry.
