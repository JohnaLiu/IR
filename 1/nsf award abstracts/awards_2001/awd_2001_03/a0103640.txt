Abstract    :
              A Survey of the Sharks and Rays of Borneo and their Metazoan Parasites

In a
              collaborative effort involving parasite and elasmobranch taxonomists
from
              eight different institutions in the US, Australia and Malaysia, this
project
              will focus on the elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) and their metazoan
parasites
              of the inshore and freshwater habitats of East Malaysia on the
island of
              Borneo.  Preliminary surveys suggest that this region is home to well
over 100
              species of sharks and rays, many of which are poorly known, and at
least some
              of which are likely to be new to science.  At present,
essentially no records
              of metazoan parasites exist for sharks and rays of this
geographic region.  It
              is anticipated that the project will yield an
extensive diversity of metazoan
              parasites belonging to at least four animal
phyla, including all four major
              groups of platyhelminths, as well as annelids,
nematodes and perhaps as many
              as five major groups of arthropods.  

Metazoan parasite diversity in sharks
              and rays generated from data collected in a
previous survey conducted
              elsewhere will be tested.  These data lead to the
prediction that this region
              may yield between 500 and 1,000 species of
metazoan parasites, well over 50%
              of which are likely to be new to science.
This survey will provide essential
              baseline taxonomic data to facilitate the
development of a resource management
              plan in East Malaysia.  It will also do 
much to begin to fill in an enormous
              gap in our knowledge of parasites of
sharks and rays.
