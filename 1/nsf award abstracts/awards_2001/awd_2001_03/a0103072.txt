Abstract    :
              This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019.  Sensitivity at the
              level of individual quanta is required for such diverse applications of
              nanosensors as characterization of macromolecules and biological objects,
              monitoring of molecular binding, and control of dephasing processes in quantum
              dots.  In nanoscale structures the phonon exchange is too fast, and strong
              thermal (phonon) coupling between the sensor and its surroundings puts strict
              limitations on the sensitivity of ordinary bolometric sensors.  In the
              hot-electron sensor, the incoming quanta overheat only electron states, which
              relax to equilibrium due to electron-phonon coupling.  The sensitivity of
              hot-electron sensors can be improved by weakening the effective coupling
              between electrons and phonons.  In nanoconductors, the electron-phonon
              interaction is substantially modified in comparison with the interaction in
              bulk materials. Due to the interference between electron-phonon and
              electron-boundary scattering, the electron relaxation/dephasing rate depends
              drastically on vibrations of boundaries.  It may vary over a wide range,
              spanning several orders of magnitude, and may be controlled by selection of a
              substrate material.  The proposed research includes complex investigations of
              the interference between electron scattering mechanisms in superconducting
              nanostructures and experimental demonstration of the electron energy relaxation
              controlled by elastic electron scattering from boundaries and defects as well
              as the design of a new hot-electron sensor with a record value of the noise
              equivalent power, NEP=10-20W/Hz1/2, and the energy resolution of 5 10-24J,
              which will be able to count individual low-energy quanta (photons or
              phonons).
