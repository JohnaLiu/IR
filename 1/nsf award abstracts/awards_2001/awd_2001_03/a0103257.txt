Abstract

This research is aimed at developing
              effective methodology for the study of nanoscale mechanical behavior of
              materials. In particular, combined atomistic simulations and continuum models
              will be developed to investigate the energetics of dislocation nucleation and
              motion and their respective roles in nanoscale discrete plastic deformation.
              The nanoindentation technique will be used to probe the mechanical behavior of
              materials at the nanoscale as well as to validate the developed methodology.
              The emphasis will be to link atomistic simulations and continuum approaches to
              develop a mechanism-based model that is able to predict mechanical behavior of
              crystalline materials at length scales ranging from nanometers to submicrons.
              Collaborations with national laboratory and industry partners will focus on
              practical applications of the developed models.
