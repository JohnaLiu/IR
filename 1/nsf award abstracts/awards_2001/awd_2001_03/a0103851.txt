Abstract    :
              The investigator studies  various K-theories  of algebraic varieties
and their
              relation to arithmetic cohomologies. In the case of classical
algebraic
              K-theory this relation has found numerous applications in
number theory, for
              example, to special values of L-functions of motives.
In the last couple of
              year the investigator has introduced log-K-theory
groups of log-schemes
              (log-scheme is a generalization of a toric variety)
and studied their basic
              properties.  She proposes to continue studying
these groups as well as
              regulator maps into log-crystalline and log-etale
cohomologies.  She believes 
              that this will have important arithmetic
applications.

This proposal deals
              with number theory and algebraic geometry. 
Number theory is the study of the
              properties of the whole numbers
and is the oldest branch of mathematics.
              Algebraic geometry studies
geometric figures that can be defined by the
              simplest of equations,
namely polynomials. The questions and phenomena which
              arise from
combining these two subjects serve as driving forces in much
              of
contemporary mathematics research. Moreover, the combination of
these
              subjects has contributed many applications in such diverse
areas as codes and
              data transmission, robotics, and theoretical
computer science.
