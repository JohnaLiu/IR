System and Compiler Support
              for Component-Based Construction of Scalable Internet Services

The principal
              investigators propose to investigate system and compiler support for an
              emerging class of Scalable Internet Service (SIS) applications.  This proposed
              work will be motivated by the emergence of the Internet as the global,
              ubiquitous networking infrastructure, and its accompanying computing model
              where much of the computing takes place on servers rather than local machines. 
              SIS applications provide a rich set of services such as on-line auctions, stock
              exchanges, and instant messaging to diverse clients worldwide.
