Abstract    :
              EIA-0103594 Tomasz Haupt  Mississippi State University Computational Vortals for
              Next Generation Scalable Computing

Computational Power constantly is opening
              new opportunities for numerical simulations, in turn opening opportunities for
              new science.  This computational power is expected to be a low cost alternative
              for design and validation, boosting efficiency of manufacturing, and be a
              reliable source of forecast (e.g., weather earthquakes. the stock market, to
              name just a few domains), as well as all the other claimed and realized
              advantages for academic computing.  This constant demand for faster and faster
              compute servers drives vendors to introduce more and more sophisticated;
              scalable architectures including scalable interconnects.

The PI's will
              develop high-level user directed assists to enable application programs to
              exploit cluster-computing resources; this will connect application level
              resource requirements with lower-level scheduler and middleware resources.  The
              work will advance the usability of clusters by a significant class of
              applications.
