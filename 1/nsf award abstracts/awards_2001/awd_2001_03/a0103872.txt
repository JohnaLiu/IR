Abstract    :
              This research encompasses problems in the two areas of stochastic flows and
              coupling of diffusions.  The principal problems in the latter area involve a
              probabilistic proof of Moser's Harnack inequality and a search for the best
              coupling on manifolds.  In the former area, the problems concern the
              qualitative and quantitative behavior of Brownian and turbulent flows,
              especially their dispersion properties.

The general setting of the set of
              problems on coupling is the behavior of steady state temperature distributions
              on manifolds (surfaces for example) and the rate of convergence to this steady
              state.  The scope of the work on stochastic flows is quite broad.  It presently
              concerns the nature of dispersion of oil slicks or high temperature bodies on
              the ocean's surface.  The ultimate goal is to apply some of the ideas from
              previous and current work to solve problems about the fractal nature of the
              energy of the magnetic field on the sun.
