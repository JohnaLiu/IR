Abstract    :
              Title:  NGS:  Efficient Script-Based Application Development for Networked High
              Performance Computing Environments.

This action will continue the research
              on the GrADS technologies for building Grid applications and to expand their
              applicability to new classes of applications.  In particular, the work will
              concentrate on workflow- style applications from mesoscale weather forecasting
              and computational biology.  In addition, it will explore enhanced technologies
              for automatic construction of grid applications from high-level specifications,
              along with new mechanisms for performance monitoring and rescheduling.  The
              results will be demonstrated on new versions of the two GrADS testbeds.
