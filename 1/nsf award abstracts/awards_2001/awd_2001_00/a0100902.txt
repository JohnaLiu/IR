Abstract    :
              The investigators will deploy an array of latitudinally spaced magnetometers at
              low latitudes along the coast of Chile.  The array will include a total of 11
              sites extending from the northern coast of Chile to the tip of the Antarctic
              Peninsula.  The array will provide the scientific community with much needed
              low latitude data from the South American continent by bridging the gap between
              existing chains of stations.  The data are used to study the processes by which
              energy from the solar wind is transferred to the inner magnetosphere and
              generates pulsations and transient variations on the ground at low latitudes. 
              The project is a collaborative effort between UCLA and a number of Chilean
              universities.  Data from the array will also be used to study geomagnetic
              effects resulting from large solar storms.
