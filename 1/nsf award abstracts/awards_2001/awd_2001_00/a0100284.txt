Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for purchase of a cryo-cooling device to be
              installed in a shared facility used for x-ray protein crystallography. 
              Crystallographic studies now play a central role in biology as the sequencing
              of large stretches of DNA reveals more and more genes whose role in the cell
              are poorly understood.  Cryo-cooling minimizes radiation damage to protein
              crystals during data collection, and is an essential feature of modern x-ray
              crystallography workstations.  At least 90% of the current crystallography
              projects on campus require cryo-cooling, including structural studies of a
              thermostable glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, other NAD binding
              enzymes, human bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein, EF-hand calcium
              binding proteins, anti-DNA antibodies, and enzymes in the alginate biosynthetic
              pathway. Although one such device is already available to the PIs, usage of the
              X-ray facility is expected to increase significantly as a result of the recent
              establishment of a Structural Biology Core facility for which they are
              responsible.
