Abstract    :
              For countries with large immigrant populations such as the United States,
              Canada, and Australia, the skills of immigrants constitute an important part of
              national human resources.  However, little is known about what determines 1)
              the skills immigrants bring to their host country, and 2) how well immigrants
              perform in the new labor markets they enter.  Existing immigration studies have
              demonstrated that the level of development and inequality in the
              country-of-origin influences immigrants' skills and socioeconomic outcomes, but
              have given little attention to local social environments and the nature of 
              immigrant networks between the source and host countries.  This project
              examines how these local characteristics and immigrant networks affect the
              labor market skills and economic success of immigrants.  

The project uses
              decennial census data collected by government agencies of three destination
              countries - the United States, Canada, and Australia.  It then links these data
              to various national level indicators gathered from publications of the United
              Nations and other international organizations.  The new and more comprehensive
              data combine country-of-origin attributes with characteristics of the
              immigrants' settlement areas.  The analyses then estimate the effects of human
              capital, social capital, and macro social factors on immigrant outcomes for
              groups that differ by national origin and destination.
