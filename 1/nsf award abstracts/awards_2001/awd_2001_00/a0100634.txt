Abstract    :
              The focus of this work is (1) on principles and applications of manipulating
              gaseous Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC's) with laser light under realistic
              experimental conditions.  The research will also focus (2) on modeling the
              loading of optical lattices using a BEC and (3) on studying the characteristics
              of a practical atom laser beam.  The work will provide new capabilities for the
              investigation of practical atom lasers.
