Abstract    :
              This research is investigating the gas-phase formation pathways of organic
              acids, hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides and other multifunctional
              oxygenated and nitrated compounds in the atmosphere.  The P.I. is developing a
              novel solid phase microextraction technique (SPME) which, combined with gas
              chromatography/mass spectrometry, will help determine important reaction
              pathways for the production of secondary aerosols in the atmosphere.  This
              research is of critical importance to understand the biochemical effects
              associated with atmospheric aerosols and sources of airborne acidity in the
              environment.
