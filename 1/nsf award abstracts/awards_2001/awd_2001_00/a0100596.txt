Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the continuing work of Dr. Frederick D. Lewis in the Department of
              Chemistry at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.   The research is
              based on earlier studies of the spectroscopy and photochemistry or organic
              molecules.   The relationship between molecular structure and the behavior of
              electronic states will be explored in three different systems: 1)
              one-dimensional arrays of pi stacked poly(arylurea) chromophores, 2) aromatic
              amines, and 3) unsaturated aromatic molecules that undergo photochemical
              cyclization reactions.

This research in the area of organic photochemistry
              involves synthesis, structural studies using NMR and x-ray crystallography, and
              studies of excited state behavior using a combination of spectroscopy,
              computational methods, and product isolation and characterization.   The work
              is expected to provide excellent training for the students involved, and could
              lead to the development of organic materials with applications as wires and
              sensors.
