Abstract    :
              The principal investigator plans to work on various problems in
 the theory of
              several complex variables and complex dynamics.  With 
 Professor Sibony, the
              principal investigator will work on a systematic 
 development of the theory
              of iterations of holomorphic  maps.  This 
 depends on the use of
              pluripotential theory to construct  invariant 
 measures as well as a broad
              range of function theoretic tools from the 
 theory of several complex
              variables. One of the main problems in the 
 theory of dynamical systems is
              that the equations  are too difficult 
 for rigorous study. Holomorphic maps 
              have enough structure so that 
 many results can be proved rigorously thereby
              giving an idea of phenomena 
 that can occur also in more complicated systems.
              The principal
 investigator also plans to work on several problems in the
              theory of 
 several complex variables. This includes generalizations of the 

              Bochner-Hartogs extension Theorem to more general manifolds and to 
 solutions
              of the Cauchy-Riemann equations in singular spaces.


    The goals of this
              proposal are to study problems in complex analysis
 and in dynamical systems
              using techniques of complex analysis. Complex
 numbers were introduced to
              solve algebraic expressions that could not 
 be solved with real numbers. With
              time, complex numbers have proved to 
 be necessary to explain fundamental
              physical phenomena like electromagnetisms, vibrations in mechanical systems,
              etc. Complex analysis studies the changes of quantities that depend on complex
              numbers. Dynamical systems is the study of systems that change over time.
              Examples of dynamical
 systems range from the weather to the study of
              populations. Dynamical
 systems are in general very hard to model and to
              understand. The simplest
 models involve using real algebraic expressions to
              represent the system.
 Considering the algebraic expressions over the complex
              numbers allows
 one to see and study the problems in a higher dimensional
              setting and
 using more powerful tools. In this setting, a very intricate
              and
 fascinating scenario appears. Computer generated pictures show the

              geometry of this phenomenon: a very complicated fractal structure.
 Proper
              understanding of this geometry will lead to a better understanding
 of real
              dynamical systems.
