Abstract    :
              This proposal is about the study of some asymptotic problems
in Fluid Mechanics
              and Gas Dynamics. 
Asymptotic problems arise when a dimensionless  
parameter
              epsilon  goes to zero  in an equation describing the motion 
of some type of 
              fluid (or any other  physical system). Many mathematical 
problems  are
              encountered when we try to justify the passage to the limit, 
which are mainly
                due to  the change of the  type of the equations, the 
presence of many 
              spatial and  temporal scales,  the presence of  boundary 
layers  (we can no
              longer impose the same boundary conditions for the 
initial system and the 
              limit one), the presence  of oscillations in
time  at high   frequency ....
              
In this Proposal, the PI intends to study (among other problems)
the
              hydrodynamic  limit of the Boltzmann equation, the
              
compressible-incompressible limit, 



These asymptotic problems allow us
              to get simpler models at 
the limit, due to the fact that we usually have
              
fewer variables or (and) fewer unknowns. This simplifies 
the numerical
              simulations and improves our understanding of 
the prevailing phenomenon when
              the parameter is small,  in fact, 
instead of  solving the initial system, we
              can solve the limit 
system and then add a corrector.
