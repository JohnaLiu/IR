Abstract    :
              Recommended project is for measurement of the platinum group elements (PGE),
              chalcophile elements, and Os isotopic compositions on well-characterized
              dunites and harzburgites from the Oman ophiolite, representing relict samples
              from obducted oceanic mantle.  The major goal is to determine the Os isotopic
              and PGE composition of the mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB) mantle source,
              principally to test whether it has chondritic Os and PGE signatures that are
              fractionated from chondrites (as are abyssal and massif peridotites).  The
              proposal will also examine PGE mobility during magmatic and alteration
              processes, considering specifically whether wall-rock interaction during melt
              transport and weathering of exposed rock can change PGE values.  This work will
              provide important constraints regarding the origin of the MORB source, and
              should help to resolve geochemical contraditions presented between ophiolites
              and abyssal peridotites regarding whether they are both residues of MORB
              melting.
