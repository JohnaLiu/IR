This award supports a joint US-NZ Workshop on Civil
              Infrastructure Systems (CIS) Research, to be held in October 2001 in
              Christchurch, New Zealand.

The goal of the Symposium is to provide an expert
              forum for identifying and comparing common problems and solutions, for
              exchanging ideas on recent and future developments, and for promoting
              international cooperative research in all areas of Civil Infrastructure
              Systems.  The Workshop will last four days.  Two days will involve invited
              presentations; the third day will consist of workshop sessions; the fourth day
              will involve a field visit to the City of Wellington.  Prepared papers by
              invited representatives from the US and NZ will exemplify contemporary issues
              in Civil Infrastructure Systems, with an emphasis on asset planning and
              management in a multi-hazard environment.
