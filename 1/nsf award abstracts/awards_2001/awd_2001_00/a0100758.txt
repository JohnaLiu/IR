This award to University of Delaware provides instrumentation
              to update and expand the oceanographic research capabilities of the research
              vessel Cape Henlopen, a ship operated by the University's College of Marine
              Studies as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System
              (UNOLS) research fleet.  The CTD and vehicle spare parts supported here will
              both be used with a towed undulating vehicle for 3-dimensional characterization
              of physical, chemical and biological properties of the water column.  These
              improvements will be of substantial advantage to marine scientists using the
              ship in their research during 2001 and future years.
