Abstract    :
              Professor Xia proposes to continue his investigation of dynamics of
Hamiltonian
              systems. One of the most important problems in Hamiltonian
dynamical systems
              is whether orbits in typical systems are stable.  The
proposed research will
              address these problems, with research topics such as
Aubry-Mather theory,
              Arnold diffusions, chaotic behaviors and Newtonian
$n$-body problem. The
              ultimate goal is to show that typical near integrable
Hamiltonians in higher
              dimensions are topologically unstable.

The proposed research concerns the
              stability problems in Hamiltonian
dyanmics. Hamiltonian dynamical systems
              model many systems arising
from classical mechanics, celestial mechanics and
              physics. These
problems has a long history, going back to Poincare and
              Birkhoff. A
typical question one often asks is the following: Is our solar
              system
stable? One of our goals is to find an answer to this and a
              large
class of related questions. With recent progresses in the theory
              of
modern dynamical systems, we understand much better the chaotic nature
of
              typical systems. However, the stability problem remains open except
in some
              special cases and it is one of the most important areas of
study, from both
              theoretical point of view and wide applications it
finds in various physical
              systems.
