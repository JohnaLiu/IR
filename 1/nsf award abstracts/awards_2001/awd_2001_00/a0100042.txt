Abstract    :
              The investigator will study finite groups from Combinatorial, Probabilistic and
              Computational point of view.  The research will proceed in three major
              directions.  First, the problem of generating random group elements is studied.
              The two major venues: Babai algorithms and the product replacement algorithm -
              both will be attacked by the investigator.  Second problem involves recognition
              of the finite groups based on the random elements. Finally, third problem deals
              with property testing of groups is studied, by introducing random subproducts
              as pseudo random elements in the finite group.

Finite groups can be viewed
              as sets of symmetries of finite objects; they are central in understanding of
              our universe.  Finite groups are often unimaginably large, which represents
              both theoretical and computational difficulties for working with all its
              elements.  Thus the information about the group is often stored in a small set
              of elements (generators), so that all other group elements can be obtained from
              these.  Now the difficult problem is reversing this encoding and recovering
              information about the whole group from the generators.  The current proposal
              aims at developments of the new algorithms and improvement of the existing
              procedures.
