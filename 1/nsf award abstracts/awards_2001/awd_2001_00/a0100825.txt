Abstract    :
              The New World monkeys (platyrrhines) are a diverse group of primates whose
              evolutionary history in South and Central America dates back to at least the
              late Oligocene. Despite a great deal of study in recent decades the
              evolutionary relationships between species of this group have been difficult to
              resolve. Studies of craniodental and postcranial anatomy, as well as molecular
              data, have produced conflicting results, especially with regard to marmosets
              and tamarins. In addition, the relationships of Saimiri (the squirrel monkeys),
              Cebus (capuchins), Aotus (owl monkeys), and Callicebus (titi monkeys) to the
              rest of the New World monkeys are equivocal in most analyses. 
The present
              study seeks to contribute to the resolution of these uncertainties by providing
              information from a hitherto poorly known region of anatomy, the paranasal
              sinuses.  The paranasal sinuses are hollow mucous-lined outpocketings of the
              nasal cavity that occupy various portions of the facial skeleton in mammals.
              Sinus anatomy is well documented in Old World monkeys and apes, in which it
              provides diagnostic features of several genera and groups of genera. It has yet
              to play a role in studies of NWM relationships because our knowledge of which
              sinuses are present in different species is very incomplete. What little
              information we have indicates that these monkeys may exhibit a greater
              diversity of sinus patterns than any other group of primates. 
This project
              will used computed tomography scanning of dry crania as a non-invasive means of
              imaging the internal anatomy of the sinuses in forty-seven specimens of
              platyrrhines representing ten genera. Each genus is represented by an
              age-graded series of specimens from juvenile to adult, allowing the development
              of their sinuses to be documented for the first time. 
The taxonomic
              distribution of sinus anatomy documented by this analysis will be compared to
              several competing phylogenetic hypotheses in order to reveal which
              relationships it supports. By completing our knowledge of sinus patterns in
              higher primates, these data will also facilitate interpretation of sinus
              anatomy in fossil representatives of Old World monkeys and apes.
