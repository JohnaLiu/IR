Abstract    :
              Dr. William M. Jackson of the Department of Chemistry, University of California
              at Davis, is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the
              Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work on the
              molecular dynamics of the photo-dissociation of ions, photon induced ion-pair
              formation, and photon induced Rydberg dissociation in various light
              halo-alkanes using velocity ion imaging techniques.

This study will provide
              significant information on the photochemistry of light halo-alkane
              hydrocarbons. As well, several under-represented minority students will be
              mentored and trained in an area that is somewhat unique in the country and that
              requires both experimental and theoretical efforts.
