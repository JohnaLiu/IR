Abstract    :
              This is a  Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award.
               The goal of the project is to develop global meta-hybrid approaches and
              corresponding software tools for the efficient solution of large-scale supply
              chain optimization applications and other massive combinatorial optimization
              problems. This research effort is built on  recent research in heuristics for
              combinatorial optimization, including the global meta-heuristic Nested
              Partitions (NP) framework.  The focus is on problem classes for which fast
              heuristics may be developed for both the construction of feasible solutions and
              for the improvement of such solutions. However, rather than considering
              heuristics in isolation,  the researchers wish to obtain maximum benefit from
              their availability by employing them within the global framework of
              partition-based strategies.  The term global meta-hybrid is used to denote the
              combination of a global meta-heuristic with linear programming technology. 
              Such a hybrid combines the lower bound information available from linear
              programming relaxations with the upper bound and feasible solution data from
              the heuristic in a synergistic fashion.

This project will yield mathematical
              techniques and corresponding computer software for the generation of
              high-quality solutions for large-scale supply chain models as well as
              large-scale combinatorial optimization problems arising from other applications
              such as radiotherapy.  Such problems are intractable for current approaches
              that do not take advantage of the special properties  to exploit within the
              methodological framework.  This project is a collaboration with Rockwell
              Automation.
