Moy

Moy will investigate two topics in the representation theory of
              reductive p-adic groups.  In the first project, Moy will study the use of the
              Bruhat-Tits building of a reductive group in its representation theory and
              harmonic analysis.  Moy will investigate by two different methods the very old
              fundamental conjecture that every irreducible supercuspidal representation is
              compactly induced from an open compact modulo center subgroup.  The first of
              these two methods is based upon extension of earlier joint work of Moy and
              Prasad which proved the conjecture in the case the supercuspidal representation
              has depth zero.  The second method would be to show that any irreducible smooth
              representation which does not contain a cuspidal representation of a parahoric
              subgroup must have a nonzero Jacquet functor.  Both these methods involve the
              Bruhat-Tits building.  Also as part of the first project, Moy will extend his
              joint work with Barbasch which gave a new proof of the Howe conjecture on
              orbital integrals to other twisted cases.  For the second project, Moy will
              investigate explicit construction of G-invariant essentially compact
              distributions on the group G.
