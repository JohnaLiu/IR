Abstract    :
              Graph Theory is a central subject of Discrete Mathematics, important both for
              theoretical reasons and in view of its wide applicability.  It models patterns
              (and strength) of connections between the components of complex systems.
              Investigation of very large graphs usually require special mathematical
              tools.

The most widely known example for very large graphs is the connection
              structure of the Internet, where various parts differ substantially.  Breaking
              up such large graphs to a small number of more homogeneous and thus more
              manageable pieces is the core of the PI's current research.
