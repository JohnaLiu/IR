Abstract    :
              This work will exploit recent advances in atomic de Broglie wave interferometry
              for precise measurements of rotation and for new tests of the Equivalence
              Principle. The potential impact of Bose-Einstein condensed sources on future
              precision measurements will be experimentally assessed through application of
              atomic AC Josephson effects to sensitive and precise measurements of
              acceleration and h/m (the ratio of Planck's constant to atomic mass), and
              through the study of squeezed many-body atomic states in the context of
              achieving statistical sensitivities below the atom shot-noise limit. The
              dynamic evolution of entangled many-body quantum states will be studied in
              connection with this latter goal.
