Abstract    :
              The investigator and his colleagues study various problems in
the analytic
              theory of L-functions and mean values of multiplicative
functions.  In
              particular the investigator aims for an improved
understanding of the
              distribution of zeros of L-functions,
their behaviour at special values, and
              the size of extreme values
in the critical strip.  The second main aim of this
              project is
to describe the spectrum of possible mean-values of
              multiplicative
functions whose values at primes are constrained to lie in
              special
subsets of the unit disc.  The investigator, in collaboration
with
              Granville, intends to develop further the close connection between
such mean
              values and solutions to a family of integral equations.


This project
              concerns problems in the area of multiplicative
number theory.  A fundamental
              problem in this area is to understand
the zeros of the Riemann zeta function
              and other L-functions.  These
functions encode much information about prime
              numbers, and
other arithmetic objects.  Besides being of intrinsic interest
              to
mathematicians, ideas emerging from these problems have found use
in
              computer science, cryptography and coding theory.
