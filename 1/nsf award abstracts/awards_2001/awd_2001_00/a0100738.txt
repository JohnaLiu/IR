This award for a planning visit to France involves scientists
              and administrators from the Universities of Florida, North Carolina and Texas
              in the US and the Universities of Bordeaux, Paris and Strasbourg in France. 
              The goal is to prepare an international IGERT (Integrative Graduate Education,
              Research and Training) proposal in advanced chemical concepts, which will be
              submitted to the 2001-2002 IGERT competition.  The proposed IGERT program's
              goal is to provide extensive international experience and a multidisciplinary
              training program to US and French Ph.D. students, possibly leading to a joint
              Ph.D. degree.  The US team and French counterparts will plan the science and
              training areas of the program and hold discussions on degree equivalence,
              residency requirement, tuition waivers, and other questions related to the
              development of a dual Ph.D. or international Ph.D. program.
 
This award
              represents the US side of a joint planning visit.  The National Science
              Foundation will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US team.  The
              French Ministry of Research will provide similar funding to the French team for
              a reciprocal visit to the United States.
