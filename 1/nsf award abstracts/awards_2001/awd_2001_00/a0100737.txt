Abstract    :
              Technical Abstract:

The research will primarily focus on three areas: (i)
              the
existence and determination of asymptotic interpolation 
measures for
              multivariate polynomial interpolation; (ii) inverse
problems for the 2D
              Laplacian; (iii) asymptotics for minimal
energy points on the sphere in
              n-dimensional Euclidean space.
Regarding (i), the research is expected to
              result in algorithms
for discretization of certain algebraic curves.
              Concerning (ii)
we will explore a new method based on best meromorphic
              approximation
for the nondestructive testing of homogeneous bodies for
              
faults (cracks). Regarding (iii), we shall investigate the 
limiting
              behavior of point sets on the sphere generated by 
certain minimum energy
              criteria and also devise fast algorithms
for "near-optimal" point sets. In all
              phases of the research,
potential theory is expected to be a useful
              tool.

Non-technical Abstract:

The research will primarily focus on three
              problem areas:
(i) the noninvasive detection of faults (cracks) in
              homogeneous
media, (ii) near-optimal configurations of large numbers
of
              sampling points  on a sphere, and (iii) the determination 
of near-optimal
              sampling points on certain curves. Regarding
(i), the goal is to develop an
              efficient algorithm (program)
that utilizes only boundary data to determine
              the existence
and location of cracks inside a conducting material.
              Concerning
(ii), we shall investigate point sets on the sphere that
arise in
              the structural analysis of large molecules, and also
serve as well distributed
              locations (eg. on Earth) for sampling
climate data for global weather models.
              Regarding (iii), we shall
explore point sets on certain curves that can be
              used for
geometric design and data sampling purposes.
