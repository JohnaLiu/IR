The Sixth International Conference on the Fundamentals of
              Fracture is the latest in a series of meetings, held every four years, that
              assembles researchers to discuss the latest in theoretical and experimental
              research in the field of fracture. The wide-ranging discussions are held in
              locations that rotate around the globe from Asia to Europe and the United
              States. Its purpose is to foster collaborations and information exchanges among
              the best and brightest in the field of fracture.  It has been especially
              successful in introducing a host of graduate students and post-docs to senior
              researchers and has led to the development of a significant number of new,
              long-standing relationships. This series of meetings is specifically dedicated
              to the science of fracture. The list of topics shows the organizing committee's
              desire to cover a broad range of materials systems and physical aspects of
              fracture. The preliminary list of topics include: atomistics of fracture,
              mesoscopic scale modelling, multiscale phenomena & modelling, crack dynamics,
              steels & other engineering materials, environmental effects, fundamentals of
              fatigue, and interfacial fracture.Support in the amount of $5K is provided to
              fund graduate student and post-doctoral attendee fellowships to maximize
              attendance from these groups that are traditionally under-represented at
              international meetings. 
%%%
With the exception of isolated symposia within
              national meetings, such as the MRS, there are no meetings specifically
              dedicated to the science of fracture. The closest one is the International
              Congress on Fracture held every 3 years (the last one held in Australia in
              1997). That series of meetings has an engineering-oriented flavor and does not
              deal with fundamental scientific issues.
