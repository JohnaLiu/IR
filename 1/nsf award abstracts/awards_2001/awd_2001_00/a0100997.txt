Abstract    :
              The effects of outflowing ionospheric ions on the dynamics of the magnetosphere
              is an inherently very difficult problem to study.  A natural way of studying
              such phenomena is to utilize kinetic particle simulations.  The difficulty in
              doing such simulations has been the large amounts of computer time required to
              generate physically reasonable results.  New version of the EMPM
              (Electromagnetic Particle Model) code has been developed to make use of the
              capabilities of massively parallel computers such as the ORIGIN 2000 or the
              Cray T3E.  This new code will provide a factor of two improvement in spatial
              resolution over the previous code and will provide better dynamics of the inner
              magnetosphere and ring current.

Ionopsheric models of outflowing heavy ions
              will be used to incorporate the injection of these ions into the magnetosphere.
               The EMPM code will then be used to study the dynamics of magnetic storms as
              affected by the presence of heavy ions.  In particular, the effect of changes
              in the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) will be investigated.  This will be
              done using simplified time-varying IMFs to determine the effect of the varying
              IMF on the M-I coupling due to overflow of ionospheric ions.
