Abstract    :
              The project addresses questions concerning the distribution of
rational and
              integral points on higher dimensional algebraic varieties.
The main problem is
              to relate the Zariski density and the asymptotic
distribution of points to
              global geometric invariants.

Number theory is one of the oldest branches of
              mathematics.
Today it is marked by profound connections to geometry
and
              analysis. It has a wide range of applications to
data transmission, storage
              and cryptography. For example,
many algorithms are based on arithmetic
              properties of elliptic curves.
This research explores the higher dimensional
              case of surfaces
and threefolds.
