Abstract    :
              This award is for an exploratory operation to investigate mineralogic changes in
              Holocene and modern speleothems from caves in the Seito River Valley, Nepal, in
              order to increase understanding of late Holocene Indian summer monsoon
              variability.  In well- vented, dolomitic caves, calcite stalagmites indicate
              humid conditions while aragonite stalagmites record relatively arid cave
              conditions and accompanying in-cave evaporation.  In many cases, deposition of
              calcite formed during precipitation-laden summer monsoons alternates with
              aragonite formed from reduced drip rates at the end or between monsoons.  In
              order to better quantify the relationship between changes  in speleothem
              mineralogy and climate, the project will perform cage fluid chemical studies
              (elemental and isotopic) and elemental analyses of the speleothems, as well as
              increase the geographic coverage of sampled caves.
