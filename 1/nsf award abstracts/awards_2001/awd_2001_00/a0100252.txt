Abstract    :
              The proposed project has several related components: 1) We
plan to continue our
              study of the Schelling segregation
model as a dynamical system. This model,
              which first arose
in economics, is related to a number of lattice models
              in
statistical physics like the lattice gas, but more difficult
due to the
              inherent non-local nature of site coupling; 2) We
plan to study the "rigidity"
              of periodic point invariants
for symbolic and hyperbolic dynamical systems.
              These
topological invariants include, for a Holder continuous
function f, the
              unmarked periodic orbit spectrum, the beta
function P(-s f), and the zeta
              function. These invariants
are fundamental objects of study in dynamics and
              statistical
physics, but the information about the function f they
capture is
              subtle and poorly understood; 3) We plan to
continue our investigation into
              the distribution of values
of fundamental quantities in ergodic theory (e.g.
              Lyapunov
exponents, local entropy, and Birkhoff averages)  and the
fine
              structure of the corresponding phase space
decomposition.

The proposed
              project has several related components: 1) We
plan to continue our study of
              the Schelling segregation
model as a dynamical system. This model, which was
              first
proposed by the eminent economist Thomas Schelling, is
related to a
              number of lattice models in statistical physics
like the lattice gas, but more
              difficult due to the inherent
non-local nature of site coupling; 2) Pressure
              is a
fundamental object of study in statistical physics, but even
in highly
              idealized systems, the information about the
system it captures is subtle and
              poorly understood. We plan
to study whether certain systems are completely
              identified
by their pressure. These problems have striking similarities
to
              fascinating questions which Kac adroitly summarized with
the question "Can you
              hear the shape of a drum?"; (3) For
ergodic systems, the time average of a
              function along almost
every orbit equals the spatial average. Only very rarely
              can
almost every orbit be replaced by every orbit. We plan to
study the fine
              structure and dimension of the exceptional
set whose time average does not
              coincide with the spatial
average
