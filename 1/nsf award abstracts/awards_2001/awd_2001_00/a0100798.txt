Abstract    :
              The focus of this proposal is the design and implementation of
cluster-based
              electronic commerce servers (or simply distributed
e-commerce servers) that
              are efficient, scalable, and capable of
service differentiation.  To achieve
              these properties, our servers
will efficiently adapt their quality of service,
              will efficiently
handle any type of incoming request according to the client's
              profile,
will not involve any centralized resources, and will cache both
              static
and certain dynamic content.  The key challenges are in
              determining
the set of policies and mechanisms that should be used
              to
differentiate the services provided and to implement truly efficient
and
              scalable policies and mechanisms for request processing.  At the
end of the
              project, we will demonstrate two distributed e-commerce
servers (an on-line
              store and an auction server) running on a cluster
with 64 processors.

The
              contributions of this project will be the following: (1) A
complete and
              general characterization of e-commerce workloads; (2) An
understanding of the
              issues involved in service differentiation for
distributed e-commerce servers,
              including the use of optimizations
based on the past history of actions taken
              by high-priority clients;
(3) The design, implementation, and evaluation of
              mechanisms for
shared state maintenance and transaction support in
              distributed
e-commerce servers; and (4) The study of techniques and mechanisms
              for
improving the efficiency and scalability of distributed
              e-commerce
servers.

We believe that the potential implications of our
              research and
contributions are far reaching.  In fact, we think that the
              impact of
our research can be substantial, given how significantly
              various
companies have come to rely on their on-line networking
              operations.
Furthermore, our research can be useful for operating systems
              and
distributed systems teaching purposes, as our software
              infrastructure
will provide a tool for the study of distributed e-commerce
              servers.
