Abstract    :
              The proposed research is designed to advance the recent progress on
              nonlinear
Hamiltonian PDE towards three goals:
1. Extend the local-in-time
              initial value methods to solve more complicated 
PDE.
2. Adapt the initial
              value techniques to treat initial-boundary value 
problems. 
3. Construct a
              global-in-time theory of nonlinear Hamiltonian PDE.
The proposal identifies
              specific problems whose solutions contribute 
to the three goals for which
              there are 
methods of attack emerging from the last decades' spectacular
              progress.
The studies for Goal 1 aim to extend the sharp 1-dimensional
              calculus 
techniques for proving multilinear estimates in Bourgain's Xs,b
              spaces 
by carrying out an incremental research plan, involving
small Xs,b
              denominators, spatial anisotropy and vanishing parameters.
A technique for
              recasting initial-boundary value problems as initial
value problems with
              boundary forcing has recently been developed, in
collaboration with Kenig. The
              range of applicability of this method is
the main topic of the proposed
              investigations toward Goal 2. A 
reinterpretation of the L^2 conservation law
              for the KdV equation, obtained 
in collaboration with Keel, Staffilani,
              Takaoka and Tao, has led to a new 
method for showing global wellposedness by
              constructing almost conserved 
quantities using multilinear harmonic analysis
              and the local wellposedness 
machinery. The third thrust of the proposed
              research will exploit these 
quantities to understand the long-time behavior
              of nonlinear Hamiltonian PDE.

No specific scientific or engineering
              application motivates the proposed 
studies; rather the intention is to
              contribute toward a general rigorous 
theory of nonlinear phenomena including
              turbulence, singularity formation, 
scattering and recurrence. The widespread
              applicability of Hamiltonian PDE, 
across diverse fields of current scientific
              and technological significance,  
demonstrates the central prominence of the
              proposed research to our 
science and engineering infrastructure.
