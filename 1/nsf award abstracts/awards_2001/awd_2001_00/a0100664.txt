Abstract    :
              In this proposal funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Veronica Bierbaum of the University of Colorado will pursue
              a program of research on the kinetics, mechanisms, and thermochemistry of gas
              phase ion-molecule reactions.  Tandem flowing afterglow-selected ion flow tube
              instruments will be used to study the gas-phase ion thermochemistry of
              peroxyls, hexamethylene tetramine, nobornadiene, and pentalene.  Nucleophilic
              substitution and elimination reactions, their competition, solvation effects,
              and solvent kinetic isotope effects will be examined.  Reactions of nitrogen
              and oxygen with many different ions will be investigated, with special emphasis
              on anion chemistry, novel product ions, and isotope exchange.  Negative and
              positive chemical ionization techniques for volatile organic detection will be
              extended to studying rate constants, branching ratios, H/D exchange and CID
              fragmentation patterns.

Much of the thermochemical data gathered in this
              program has relevance to important combustion and atmospheric processes.  The
              sources of high concentrations of oxygenated hydrocarbons in the earth's
              troposphere are not currently understood, but their impact on atmospheric
              chemistry is significant.  The characterization of biogenic emissions from a
              variety of growing and harvested plants addresses this critical problem in
              atmospheric chemistry.  The experimental results from this research will also
              contribute to the fundamental understanding of reaction kinetics and
              thermochemistry and will provide valuable intercomparison with theory.
