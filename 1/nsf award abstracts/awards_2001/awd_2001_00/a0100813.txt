This award co-sponsored by the Division of
              International Programs and the Division of Chemistry will support a Regional
              Workshop on Photochemistry, Photophysics, and Spectroscopy in Organized Media
              to be held in Cordoba, Argentina on May 25-28, 2001.  The workshop is organized
              by Dr. Miguel A. Garcia-Garibay of the University of California, Los Angeles
              and Professor Pedro F. Aramendia at the Universidad de Buenos Aires in
              Argentina.  

The workshop will afford 18 U.S. scientists the opportunity to
              interact with 18 counterparts from Central and South America.  It will serve to
              bring together major researchers in the area of photochemistry, photophysics,
              and spectroscopy, to explore new directions influenced by the interaction
              between light and matter in various materials systems.  Young researchers from
              the U.S. and Latin America will comprise a significant number of the
              attendees.

This workshop will focus on studies of solids, thin films,
              supramolecular aggregates, and other non-fluid systems that have important
              applications in the fields of materials science and engineering, photonics,
              sensors, and molecular computing.
