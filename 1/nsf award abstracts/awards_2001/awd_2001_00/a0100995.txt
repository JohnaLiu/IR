              Abstract: 

The grant will provide partial funding for a USA
delegation
              consisting of young Ph.D's and graduate students
to participate in the
              mathematics conference entitled
"Computational Methods and Function Theory
              '01, which
will take place during the period June 25-29, 2001 in
Aveiro
              Portugal and will focus on the interactions between
certain areas of pure and
              applied mathematics. The grant will
also provide travel funding for several
              outstanding researchers from
eastern Europe.

The grant will provide funding
              for a USA delegation of
of young Ph.D's as well as graduate students to
              participate
in a conference that will emphasize various aspects of the
              interaction
between scientific computations and the area of mathematics
known
              as function theory. The conference will also foster contacts
between
              scientists from diverse cultures.  For this purpose,
the funding provided will
              also help support some eastern European
participants.
