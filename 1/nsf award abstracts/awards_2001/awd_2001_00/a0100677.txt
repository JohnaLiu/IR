Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include
studies of:
              (i) the partonic structure of the nucleon within the
framework of perturbative
              quantum chromodynamics, (ii) the origin of
electroweak interaction symmetry
              breaking; and (iii) observable signatures
of new physics, such as
              supersymmetric particles and extra dimensions. Partons
are fundamental
              constituents (i.e. quarks and gluons) of observed nuclear
particles, such as
              protons and neutrons.  Electroweak interaction symmetry
breaking is intimately
              related to the origin of masses of fundamental
particles.  New physics
              scenarios, such as supersymmetry and extra
dimensions, if discovered, could
              extend our understanding of the extremely
successful Standard Model of
              elementary particle physics to a much deeper
level.
