Abstract    :
              This project in precision measurements seeks to measure at greatly improved
              accuracy the following four fundamental quantities:  1) the magnetic moment of
              the electron (often called its g value) ; 2) the fine structure constant; 3)
              the ratio of positron and electron g values; and 4) the ratio of the masses of
              the proton and electron.  The measurement of the fine structure constant, along
              with the measurement of g, will test QED to an unprecedented level of accuracy.
                Greatly improved techniques for trapping positrons will aid the comparison of
              measured g values for the electron and positron to provide the best test of CPT
              invariance with a lepton system.
