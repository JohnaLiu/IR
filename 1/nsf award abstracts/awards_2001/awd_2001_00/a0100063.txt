In contrast to the scientific advances in drug design, tablet
              processing has
been dominated by empiricism, and it presents a bottleneck for
              transition to
market of new discoveries.  In this basic research project,
              Drexel
University and Merck & Co., Inc. aim to develop a science basis for
              the
compaction of pharmaceutical powders that leads to solid dosages.
              Specific
objectives of this study are to: (i) establish experimental
              procedures for
characterization of pharmaceutical powders under conditions
              characteristic
of industrial operations. (ii) determine experimentally the
              origin of rate
effects and their influence on the mechanical properties of
              tablets, (iii)
formulate constitutive models that portray accurately the
              behavior of powder
mixtures during compaction, (iv) develop design guidelines
              that will allow
rational decision making in pharmaceutical powder
              formulation.
