              Operator Theory and Inverse Problems

             Abstract



  The
              proposed research will focus on a few inverse problems: 
the uniqueness in the
              multivariable moment problem, the
best approximation of planar domains with
              finitely many prescribed
moments; the inverse spectral problem for the modulus
              of the
restriction operator between the Bergman spaces of two planar
domains;
              a renormalized Riesz transform with applications to
image reconstruction in
              any dimension. Methods of operator
theory, function theory and approximation
              theory will be combined
in this work.

  In many areas of modern activity it
              is required to reconstruct
an entity from partial, and sometimes distant and
              indirect, data.
Inverse problems address such specific questions. The
              proposed
research will be concerned with a couple of inverse problems
arising
              for instance in tomography or in geophysics. To be
more specific, given a
              number of different angle X-rays of a body,
we will propose a constructive,
              optimal way of approximating, or 
sometimes reconstructing this body.
