This award provides partial funding for U.S. ocean
              scientists, particularly those in the academic research community, to
              participate in the activities of the North Pacific Marine Science Organization
              (PICES).  This organization was established in 1992 to promote and coordinate
              marine scientific research in order to advance knowledge of living marine
              resources, land-ocean and atmosphere-ocean interactions, ecosystem components
              and processes, resource usage, ocean response to global weather and climate
              change, and human impacts in the North Pacific. Members presently include
              Canada, China, Japan, Korea, Russia, and the United States. Participation by
              U.S. scientists in Annual Meetings, scientific committee working groups and
              workshops, will also be funded through this award.
