Nicholas J. Kuhn

Professor Kuhn has a long record of developing
              
methods to solve interesting problems in homotopy 
theory, K-theory, and
              representation theory.  
The goal of the largest part of this project is 
to
              connect new 'polynomial' resolutions of classic 
function spaces to other
              things: model categories of 
structured spectra, equivariant stable homotopy,
              
classial loop space theory, and periodic homotopy.  
These connections will
              be used to calculate previously 
inaccessible cohomological invariants of both
              such 
function spaces and infinite loop spaces.  A second 
part of the work
              is a continuation of the study of the 
generic representation theory of finite
              fields.  
In particular, from his homotopical/K-theoretic point 
of view, he
              is studying his newly discovered lattices 
of generalized Schur algebras, with
              an eye towards 
gaining insight about the modular representations of 
the
              finite permutation groups, and the finite general 
linear matrix
              groups.

Homotopy theory, K-theory, and representation theory 
are
              mathematical subjects in which one is trying to 
discover, and ultimately
              classify, fundamental building 
blocks of various sorts of mathematical
              structure. 
(This is quite analogous to a chemist studying simple 
molecular
              configurations, and how these can be assembled 
in more complex ways.) 
              Homotopy is concerned with 
deformations of geometric objects such as higher
              
dimensional surfaces. A sample hard problem is to 
understand the `shape' of
              all continuous functions 
from a sphere (surface of a ball) to itself. 
              
Representation theory is concerned with the algebraic 
symmetries of more
              rigid and discrete objects such 
as configurations of lines and planes. A
              sample hard 
problem is to understand all the basic ways in which 
the set of
              n by n matrices of 0's and 1's can act on 
strings of 0's and 1's.  Finally
              K-theory is a 
sophisticated hybrid of the two.  Professor Kuhn is 
studying
              new connections relating these subjects, by 
developing and using a variety of
              state-of-the-art 
algebraic and homotopy theoretic tools.
