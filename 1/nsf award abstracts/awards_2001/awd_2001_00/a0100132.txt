Abstract    :
              In this project the principal investigator proposes to develop further the
              theory of analysis on abstract metric spaces by studying Green functions on
              such spaces. The principal investigator will initially focus on four problems.
              The first question seeks to find out whether in the framework of abstract
              metric spaces the corresponding harmonic functions satisfy the strong maximum
              principle. As a long range goal the principal investigator also hopes to
              determine whether the strong maximum principle holds for p-harmonic functions
              for general values of p. The second issue is to construct the Martin boundary
              for Gromov hyperbolic metric spaces that admit Green functions.  It is also
              proposed to study some properties of Green functions, including the uniqueness
              property and the boundary Harnack principle. These two problems will be studied
              for two different constructions of Green functions, one - using the upper
              gradients, and the other - the Cheeger derivative. The fourth problem is to
              construct and study Brownian motion and the heat equation on abstract metric
              spaces.

Potential applications of the research proposed in this project
              include connections between probability theory and analysis on abstract metric
              spaces. Such spaces arise in applications in physics and engineering, and hence
              the questions addressed in the project have a potential impact in physics and
              engineering as well.
