Abstract    :
              The purpose of the proposal is to study the geometry of algebraic varieties
and
              their invariants from different points of view. In particular the
investigator
              and his colleagues study
the structure of fundamental groups and  universal
              coverings of algebraic
varieties, the problem
of placement of singularities,
              restrictions on the concentration of singular
points in special fibers of the
              fibrations of algebraic varieties. In the
latter case the goal is to develop a
              sufficiently simple method which can be
generalized to the case of arithmetic
              family of curves. The study of the
Galois groups of functional fields is going
              to provide with an alternative
approach to the problems of birational
              geometry.

The investigator suggests to continue a broad scope of research in
              the area
of algebraic geometry with potential applications to number theory
              and
theoretical physics. Of special interest is the study of a formula
that
              provides nontrivial estimates for a number of solutions in equations
similar
              in form to the famous Fermat equation..
