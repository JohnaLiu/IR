The Inaugural Woman's Initiative Committee Session entitled
              "turn of the Century Chemical Engineers: Successes and Challenges" will be held
              at the annual American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) meeting in Los
              Angeles.  It will be a full morning session from 8:30 to 11:30 am with seven
              speakers including women from industry, academia government.   Some of the
              presentations include:
-	A discussion of the work of the Congressional
              Commission on the Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering
              and Technology Development by Dr. Kathryn Johnson, Vice President of Matrix
              Consulting Group
-	A discussion of the progress made by women chemical
              engineers and opportunities for partnership between AIChE and the Women in
              Engineering Programs Advocacy Network (WEPAN) by Dr. Suzanne Brainard, Director
              of the Center for Women in Science and Engineering at the University of
              Washington.

The session is a part of a more comprehensive program to help
              women at all stages of their careers - from graduate student to tenured faculty
              as well as women in various industrial positions in the chemical process
              industries - to advance in their careers.  Other activities will continue
              during the day including the inauguration of a joint venture with the Girl
              Scouts to develop science kits which will hopefully help encourage young girls
              to study engineering.
