Abstract    :
              Hoffman will investigate the properties of endomorphisms which are
isomorphic
              to one sided Bernoulli shifts.  One direction this work
will take is to show
              that particular dynamical systems are isomorphic
to one sided Bernoulli
              shifts. In particular Hoffman will attempt to
classify which toral
              endomorphisms are isomorphic to a one sided
Bernoulli shift.  He will also
              attempt to classify all toral
endomorphisms up to isomorphism.  Hoffman will
              try to show the
differences between Ornstein's theory of Bernoulli
              automorphisms and
the emerging theory of Bernoulli endomorphisms.  A
              particular example
of this relates to compact extensions of Bernoulli
              endomorphisms.
Rudolph proved that any compact extension of a Bernoulli shift
              that is
weak mixing is isomorphic to a Bernoulli shift.  Hoffman will try
              to
show that Bernoulli endomorphisms do not share this property. 
              Hoffman
will also continue his work in probability theory.  He will
              continue
to study infinite percolation cluster on the square lattice. 
              In
particular he will compare the properties of simple random walk on
              the
square lattice with the properties of simple random walk on
              infinite
percolation clusters.  The overall goal of this portion of
              the
research is to determine if the distribution of paths for simple
random
              walk on the infinite percolation cluster can be rescaled in
such a way as to
              generate the distribution of Brownian paths in the
plane.

The study of
              randomness is a major part of the application of
mathematics to many
              interesting systems.  For example, in statistics
knowledge of randomness is
              used to make sense of data and in applied
math random processes are used to
              model financial markets dynamical
systems.  This proposal deals with
              randomness in the context of
dynamical systems and probability theory.  This
              proposal will attempt
to classify various types of mathematical systems
              according to the
type and amount of randomness that they exhibit.
