The
              International Conference on Multiphase Flows will meet for the fourth time in
              New Orleans, from May 27, 2001 to June 1, 2001.  Its purpose, every third year,
              is to bring together multiphase flow researchers from about fifty countries and
              allow these scientists and engineers exchange ideas on the recent developments
              in the field.  This is a special opportunity for the younger members of the
              community.  It is expected that their will be a projected 600 participants.
