Abstract    :
              This work is directed toward the goal of generating maximally entangled photonic
              states, either by use of a four-wave mixing device operating in a nonlinear
              regime or by coupling a pair of interferometers via a Kerr medium.  Both
              methods require media with large nonlinear susceptibilities.  Methods will be
              developed to generate such susceptibilities using the techniques of
              electromagnetically induced transparency.
