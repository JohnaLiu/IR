              			ABSTRACT

The investigator will continue his research in enumerative
              and
algebraic combinatorics. He feels that there are many opportunities
for
              strengthening the myriad connections between combinatorics and
other branches
              of mathematics. He will investigate how recent
breakthroughs in the theory of
              total positivity can be applied to open
problems concerning such topics as
              counting faces in cubical polytopes
and counting stable sets in clawfree
              graphs. The investigator will
also continue his research on the combinatorial
              properties of convex
polytopes that have arisen in such areas as statistical
              inference and
the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras. In
              particular,
he will investigate further some convex polytopes related to
              Kostant's
partition function.  He will in addition pursue a number
              of
miscellaneous problems arising in the work of Kac, Kontsevich,
Varchenko,
              and others.

The field of combinatorics was first systematically investigated
              in
the 1960's and only recently has reached a high level of maturity. It
is
              an area of mathematics that has close connections with many other
subjects,
              ranging from algebra, geometry, and statistics within
mathematics, andcomputer
              science, high-energy physics, chemistry, and
most recently biology without.
              The investigator's primary interest is
the development of connections between
              combinatorics and other areas
of mathematics. He will investigate a number of
              problems that would
continue the development of the connections between
              combinatorics and
other branches of mathematics and that would lead to the
              development
of tools that could be used by scientists outside of
              mathematics.
