Abstract    :
              The Hawaii Department of Education, in partnership with the University of Hawaii
              at Manoa, will conduct an Implementation phase RSI project for teachers and
              administrators in rural, disadvantaged schools on the islands. The project will
              rely heavily on leadership development opportunities and implementation of
              curricular standards, to achieve better learning opportunities for the targeted
              students. Much of the networking and inservice training will be conducted
              through distance learning technology.
