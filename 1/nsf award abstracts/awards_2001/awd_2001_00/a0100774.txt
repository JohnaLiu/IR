Abstract    :
              Dr. Patrick J. Farmer of the Department of Chemistry, University of California
              at Irvine, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
              Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division, National Science Foundation, for
              his work on modeling the chemistry of heme-based nitrite and sulfite
              reductases. The various enzymes perform integral steps in the biochemical
              cycling of nitrogen and sulfur, which are of importance in the global
              denitrification of soil fertilizers and in the removal of oxides of nitrogen
              and sulfur, which are pollutants from industrial waste-waters.

The studies
              will have implications for the global effects of modern agriculture, based on
              understanding the chemical basis for the generation of non-carbon greenhouse
              gases. The studies will provide a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate
              students (some are Asian, Hispanic or from Eastern European countries) with
              invaluable experience that will be relevant to the American economy, and will
              form the training ground for the next generation of scientists.
