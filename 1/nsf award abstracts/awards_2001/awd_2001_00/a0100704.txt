Abstract    :
              It is intended to provide a theoretical framework and numerical tools for
              solving the three body recombination problem and other related processes.  This
              is the situation in which three atoms simultaneously collide, forming an atom
              and a diatomic molecule, with some of the energy liberated transferred to the
              rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecule, the remainder to
              translational kinetic energy.  An important application occurs in Bose-Einstein
              condensation, where losses from the trap due to three body recombination limit
              the density achievable in condensates.
