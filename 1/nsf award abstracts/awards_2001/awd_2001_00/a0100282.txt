Abstract    :
              Abstract
A new type of actuation device has been conceptualized that meets the
              needs of large     1) displacement, 2) force and 3) bandwidth within a package
              more compact than currently available magnetostrictive and stack-type piezo
              actuators of similar rating.  The actuation mechanism relies on micro-scale
              electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumping of a dielectric liquid with a small
              concentration of free charges. 
Analytical and numerical studies have shown
              the EHD-pumped actuator to be capable of delivering equal force and bandwidth
              to magnetostrictive and stack-type piezo actuators of the same size, but with
              considerably greater displacement. Research is proposed to further analyze the
              new concept to establish a parametric understanding of the actuator with
              respect to geometry, fluid, and temperature constraints. Research is also
              proposed to experimentally verify the viability of the promising concept. A
              multitude of prototypes will be designed, fabricated, and tested to provide
              experimental benchmarking of the model predictions. 
It is envisioned that 1)
              tools for the design, fabrication, and deployment of the EHD pumped actuator,
              2) working prototypes providing force, bandwidth, and size capabilities
              superior to comparable magnetostrictive and piezo type devices will be
              developed. It is expected that these actuators will substantially impact the
              field of active sound and vibration control
