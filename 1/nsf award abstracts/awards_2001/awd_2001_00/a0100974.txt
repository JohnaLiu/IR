Abstract    :
              This project requests travel support for 10 student participants from
              U.S.
universities in the Student Paper Competition at the 2001 International
              Topical Meeting
on Microwave Photonics (MWP).
The International Topical
              Meeting on Microwave Photonics (MWP) is the major
international meeting on
              microwave photonic devices, systems and applications. The
MWP'01 is
              co-sponsored by the Microwave Theory and Techniques Society (MTT-S) and the
              Lasers and Electro-Optics Society of the Institute of Electrical and
              Electronics
Engineers (IEEE). It will be held in Long Beach, CA on October
              7-10, 2001.
Each year, the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society and
              IEEE Lasers
and Electro-Optics Society promote student education in microwave
              and photonics
engineering through a number of mechanisms. The Best Student
              Paper Program at the
MWP is one of the student outreach programs to promote
              the interactions among
students, faculty and industrial participants, and
              helps to develop the students' technical
acumen as well as their communication
              skills. It also introduces them to the international
technical community and
              helps to build a community of students who will lead the next
generation of
              microwave photonics engineers.
The MWP provides financial support of various
              forms to student presenters but
does not reimburse travel expenses. Travel
              support from NSF will ensure that the
program is open to the widest range of
              interested applicants from U.S. universities.
