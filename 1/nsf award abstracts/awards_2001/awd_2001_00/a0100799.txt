Progress beyond data storage densities
              of 100 Gbits/in2 requires a revolution in materials. Magnetic tunnel junctions
              provide a possible solution and are expected to form an essential component of
              future magnetic disk drive read heads, part of the $50 billion/year hard disk
              drive industry. 

Tunnel junctions with a R/R of 30% have been announced in
              the last year. However there are serious problems with the current generation
              of tunnel junctions, which are based exclusively on an alumina barrier layer.
              These layers are now down to 0.7 nm in thickness and still the resistances of
              the tunnel junctions are too high for the intended applications. Essentially
              the alumina tunnel junction has reached its ultimate performance limits and 
              there is a concern if alumina tunnel junctions will ever be able to be used in
              read heads and MRAM because of the high resistance. Therefore it is time for
              new tunnel junction materials to be brought forward based on alternative
              barrier layers. 

Recently studies of alternative insulator materials by Fert
              et. al. showed that the barrier layer strongly affects the spin polarization in
              the magnetic layers. Freitas et al. have studied the effect of nitrogen
              additions to the alumina which changed the barrier height and resulted in an
              increase in tunnel magnetoresistance from 22% to 25% as the composition changed
              from Al2O3 to AlN. 

However none of this has addressed the central problem
              of the overall resistance of the devices. In our proposed  SGER  we intend to
              make the radical change of completely replacing the alumina with other
              semiconductors. Of course this is a high risk endeavor, but the enormous
              benefits to the magnetic data storage industry that will accrue if the project
              is success make this a worthwhile exploratory investigation.
