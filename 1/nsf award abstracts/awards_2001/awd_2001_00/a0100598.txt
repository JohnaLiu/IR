Abstract    :
               This  project, which is divided into several parts,
is concerned with several
              interrelated areas of
algebraic geometry centered around the birational
              geometry 
and the Hodge theory of algebraic varieties. In the first part,
the
              investigators intend  to construct differentials on certain 
universal spaces
              arising in algebraic geometry, and apply these to
the study of algebraic
              cycles. In the second part
the investigators, in collaboration with D.
              Abramovich
and K.  Karu, intend to extend their previous work to the
prove
              the strong factorization conjecture for birational maps.
This conjecture says
              that any birational map between smooth
complete varieties has a particularly
              simple structure: it
is a sequence blow ups followed by a sequence of blow
              downs
with smooth centers. In the third part, the investigators
will apply
              the previously established weak factorization 
conjecture to compare the Hodge
              structure of two birationally 
equivalent minimal models. In the fourth part,
              one of the 
investigators intends to  extend their previous
              vanishing
theorems and apply them to the study of birational
invariants. In
              the fifth part,  one of the investigators will 
attempt to relate the Hodge
              theory of higher homotopy groups to 
the intersection theory of algebraic
              cycles. In the
sixth part,  one of the investigators intends to study a class
              
of surface singularities, which are important for birational
geometry, over
              fields of positive characteristic. In the
sixth and final part,  one of the
              investigators  intends to 
extend the theory of toroidal embeddings by taking
              into account
certain stratifications.

 Algebraic varieties are geometric
              objects which provide a
rich set of models for a number of phenomena within
              mathematics
as well as in neighboring fields of science such as physics
              and
computer science. They have the advantage of  being describable 
in
              finite terms, as solutions to a finite system of algebraic
equations. However,
              these descriptions are often complicated and 
not unique; deciding when two
              such descriptions lead to equivalent,
or even approximately equivalent,
              varieties is very difficult.
Approximate equivalence is made precise by the
              notion of
birational equivalence. One of the goals of this project is to
              
study the finer structure of the birational equivalence relation.
Another
              goal of this project is to introduce and study certain
natural birational
              invariants, that is, measures
of the geometric complexity of algebraic
              varieties. Some of
these invariants count the number of harmonic
              (energy
minimizing) objects associated to the algebraic variety.
These two
              goals are related since the investigators expect that the
fine structure of
              the birational maps will yield insights into
the properties of these
              invariants.
