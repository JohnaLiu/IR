Abstract    :
              AST-0100785

The CORF plays an essential role in defending the radio frequency
              interests of the U.S. scientific community before national and international
              organizations that deal with the allocation and efficient use of the radio
              spectrum.  A major CORF activity centers on participation in public pleadings
              before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding allocation and
              assignment of radio frequencies and other regulatory matters.  During the past
              3-years, covering the previous grant period, CORF filed comments before the FCC
              in matters related to unwanted emissions of satellite systems, sharing various
              radio astronomy bands with the medical telemetry service, preparations for
              WRC-00, and other matters.  During the coming 3-year period, CORF is expected
              to comment on the U.S. implementation of the results of WWRC-00, U.S. proposals
              to WRC-03 and possibly WRC-06, and the impact on radio astronomy of spurious
              emissions from transmitters on board of satellites, among others.  CORF is also
              expected to continue working with the FCC on issues related to millimeter wave
              spectrum use.
