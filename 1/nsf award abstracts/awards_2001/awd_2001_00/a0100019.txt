Partial travel support for 18 invited
              participants and speakers at the Nanomaterials Workshop in Montreal, Canada, 
              October 22-25, 2000, co-sponsored by CNRS and NSF, has been requested.  The
              objective of this meeting is to evaluate the current research results in the
              field, discuss future research directions and technological developments, the
              work needed in order to increase industrial relevance, and explore
              opportunities of collaboration.   Engineers, material scientists, chemists and
              physicists from academe and industry will attempt to identify common principles
              and approaches.  The main sessions will cover synthesis of building blocks,
              theoretical challenges, characterization (local and bulk techniques),
              mechanical properties, magnetic and optical properties, chemical and thermal
              properties, and applications.  Participation of young researchers is
              encouraged.   There will be about 18-20 invited speakers from each U.S. and
              France, as well as invited speakers from Canada.  Ample time will be allowed
              for questions and discussions.  The workshop is expected to be an interactive
              forum for participants.  A purpose of the meeting is to facilitate the
              establishment of long-term cooperation among researchers from U.S., France and
              Canada, in academe and industry in the area of nanocomposite materials.
