Abstract    :
              XML is becoming the principal medium for data exchange over the Web, and for
              information integration in general. Increasing amounts of public and private
              data are described in XML while more legacy sources (e.g., relational
              databases) offer public XML views. The feasibility of many applications that
              have emerged with the growth of XML on the Web requires new and complex query
              optimization techniques. The goal of this research project is to develop a
              "chase & backchase" optimization method for XML queries. Based on chasing with
              constraints and incorporating cost-based optimization, the method brings
              together strategies such as use of indexes, use of materialized views, semantic
              optimization and join/scan minimization, allowing optimizations that depend on
              non-trivial interactions between these strategies. Particular attention is
              given to the challenges posed by XML document order and by regular path
              expressions in queries. This project is expected to result in a theoretical
              foundation and a practical framework for defining and using indexes,
              materialized views and complex constraints in XML query processing systems. The
              practical framework will be demonstrated through a publicly available software
              prototype appropriate for teaching about XML query systems and for supporting
              related research projects.
