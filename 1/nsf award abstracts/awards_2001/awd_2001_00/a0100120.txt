Abstract    :
              The research project examines ways to utilize climate information gained by the
              scientific community in conjunction with the traditional knowledge held by
              people native to the Arctic as a determinate for making decisions in response
              to changing climate conditions in the far north.  A range of scenarios for
              changing climate conditions such as decreased sea ice,  changing frequency of
              extreme weather events, storm surges, and other environmental factors will be
              used to predict the probability of variable environmental conditions that could
              lead to decisions in the local communities about management of resources,
              marine transportation options, and coastal construction.  Local stakeholder
              groups will be used to identify how socioeconomic decision-making might be done
              in response to various probabilities for changing climate on a variety of time
              scales.  An interdisciplinary education project will integrate natural and
              social sciences with specific application to arctic climate and socioeconomic
              issues.  The project will contribute to the Human dimensions of the Arctic
              system (HARC) initiative of the Arctic System Science Program.
