Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to aid in purchase of a hybrid quadruple
              time-of-flight mass
spectrometer with electrospray ionization (ESI-MS). The
              instrument will be used by 30 basic science faculty and by approximately two
              hundred graduate students and postdoctoral fellows for diverse research in
              neurobiology, biological sensors, and nanotechnology. The instrument will be
              located in the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory in the school of chemical sciences
              where is will be managed and maintained by dedicated technical staff.  Students
              and postdoctoral associates who require instruments of this type in their
              research have the option of having professional staff run their samples, or of
              being trained to use the instrument and then running the samples themselves.
