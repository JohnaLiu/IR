This is a research project for the study of exactly
              solvable models of statistical mechanics, including the integrable chiral Potts
              model and various Ising models.  These models will be studied by exact
              analytical and approximate numerical methods.  Various physical phenomena will
              be studied, such as critical phenomena in quasi-periodic or aperiodic lattices,
              commensurate-incommensurate phase transitions, and frustration.  The impact of
              frustration on the wavevector-dependent susceptibility will be analyzed by
              studying partially and fully frustrated triangular or checkerboard Ising
              models.  New algorithms for the susceptibility series of planar Ising models,
              whose complexity grow polynomially, will be developed and the resulting long
              series expansions will be analyzed to get a better understanding of corrections
              to scaling.  Many challenging problems remaining to be solved within the
              integrable chiral Potts model, such as the magnetization, spin-spin and
              energy-energy correlations.  By its very nature, this project also involves
              several areas of mathematics of current interest.
