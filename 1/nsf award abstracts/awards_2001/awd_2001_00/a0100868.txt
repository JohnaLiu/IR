Lattice-Boltzmann techniques are simple, stable, and
              conducive to massive parallelization, but 'inflexible'.  With effort, they can
              be made more flexible.  The PI proposes to continue his efforts in this regard.
               He has developed a square, flat-bottomed ocean model using the shallow water
              equations and the quasi-geostrophic equations.  He will derive the formulae for
              a Lattice-Boltzmann primitive equation model on spherical coordinates.  He will
              also develop balanced versions of the Lattice-Boltzmann model.
