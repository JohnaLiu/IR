Abstract    :
              This award is for the partial support of the conference in the field of Partial
              Differential Equations at the University of Arkansas. The conference will
              concentrate on the area of solutions of PDE's in periodic media. The conference
              will be a part of the Arkansas Spring Lecture Series and will attract
              researchers from other areas, such as Differential Geometry (Dmitri Burago) and
              Dynamical Systems (John Mather).
