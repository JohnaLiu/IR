Abstract    :
              This project concerns definable equivalence relations and classification
              problems that are more complex than the isomorphism of countable structures.
              One of the main focuses is the universal orbit equivalence relation, namely,
              the most complex equivalence relation induced by a Borel action of a Polish
              group. The investigator studies topics such as (1) the Urysohn universal metric
              space, the isometry group and its actions, (2) actions of the unitary group,
              and (3) classification problems for various topological spaces. The obvious
              connections of these topics to analysis, geometry and topology also bring
              together the development of descriptive set theory and other fields of
              mathematics.

The descriptive set theory of definable equivalence relations
              has provided a standard scale on which complexity of various classification
              problems in mathematics can be measured. The low end of this scale is very well
              understood through the previous work in the field. But there has been
              relatively little information known for the high end. The investigator seeks to
              advance the knowledge of complex definable equivalence relations. Through this
              research it is hopeful that not only the complexity or difficulty of the
              mathematical problems involved can be better understood but also methods to
              deal with complicated and large-scale systems can be obtained and applied to
              other fields of mathematics and sciences.
