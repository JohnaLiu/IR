Abstract    :
              Networks based on the exchange of social goods among actors can involve single
              connections or compound connections.  Each type of connection has different
              effects on network performance.  Consider, for example, an office manager who
              needs the work of all subordinates to complete a task. Since all subordinates
              must contribute to complete the task, this case involves single connections. 
              Further, since any one subordinate can disrupt the task, the subordinates
              exercise power over the manager.  In contrast, compound connections include a
              reserve of potential subordinates who can replace those who do not perform, and
              give power to the manager over subordinates.  This project uses laboratory
              experimental methods to investigate how different types of compound connections
              produce different power exchange outcomes. The experiment places subjects in
              separate rooms to negotiate through connected PCs.  The manipulation involves
              differences in the number and types of compound connections in the subjects'
              networks, and the outcome involves the gains made by network members in
              competing for points.  The results extend the scope of network exchange theory
              and its application to group behavior.
