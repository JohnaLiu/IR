Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for purchase of a wide field confocal microscope
              equipped with two high- sensitivity, intensified charge-coupled-device cameras,
              a spinning disk-type confocal imaging device, and imaging software. The cells
              system capable of high speed, dual excitation or dual emission ratiometric
              imaging, and includes equipment needed for microinjection of living cells. The
              microscope will be the centerpiece for a new Laboratory for the Study of
              Developmental Dynamics to be shared by a number of investigators. The
              high-sensitivity detectors allow extended fluorescence imaging of developing
              systems that is not possible with laser scanning confocal microscopes, or
              multi-photon instruments. The system will be used by postdoctoral associates,
              graduate and undergraduate students, and faculty investigators for a variety of
              research projects in cell biology, and will provide the basis for an expanded
              course on modern techniques in optical microscopy.
