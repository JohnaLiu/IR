Abstract    :
              Work will focus on needs for new theory in three-body recombination (both
              charged-particle and neutral-particle) at ultralow energies, relevant to the
              formation of anti-hydrogen and to Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC) experiments. 
              Several significant and basic collisional mechanisms need to be described. 
              Areas of concern include Stark-mixing transitions, collisional transitions,
              vibrational quenching and collisional re-dissociation.
