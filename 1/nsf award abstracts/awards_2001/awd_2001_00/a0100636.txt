Abstract    :
              We propose an experimental and theoretical investigation of quantum interference
              current control (QUIC) in a number of large- and small-gap semiconductors. The
              investigations will include terahertz burst generation and detection using
              ultrashort laser pulses. We request funds for two graduate students and faculty
              summer salary. With prior NSF support, the basic theoretical concepts of the
              proposed experiments have been worked out, a well equipped, state-of-the-au
              ultrafast laser laboratory was set up, and preliminary experiments were
              conducted. With support committed by UNTvI / NASA's PURSUE (Preparation for
              University Research of Students in Undergraduate Education) program, one to two
              undergraduate/minority students will be involved in this project.
