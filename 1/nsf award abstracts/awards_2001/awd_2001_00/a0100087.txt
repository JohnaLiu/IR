SGER:  Exploratory
              Research for New Concepts in Ultra-rapid-cycle Adsorptive Separation of
              Air


As a step in designing a micro-scale pressure-swing-adsorption (PSA)
              oxygen concentrator, this project measures the intracrystalline diffusion
              coefficients of oxygen and nitrogen in a low-silica X zeolite.  The
              measurements are being done by use of isotopic tracers in single-crystal
              permeation apparatus.

If the gas diffusion coefficients are as large as
              expected, this work will lead to the design and fabrication, using MEMS
              technology, of a small, light-weight oxygen concentrator for use by victims of
              chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  This device will operate on a
              relatively high-frequency swing of air pressure.  The experimental diffusivity
              values will also be useful in the engineering of conventional PSA processes as
              well in the theoretical modeling of zeolite adsorption and transport.
