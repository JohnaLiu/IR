Abstract    :
              The planned research involves several interrelated areas in spectral graph
              theory, extremal graph theory and random graphs.  A main goal is to deduce the
              fundamental properties and structures of a graph from its graph spectrum (or
              from a short list of easily computable invariants).  Various combinatorial,
              geometric and probabilistic techniques are being developed for examining the
              relations and behaviors of various graph invariants and properties.  Although
              the primary objective is to advance our understanding of the intrinsic
              characteristics and underlying principles that govern discrete structures, such
              principles are quite effective and essential in dealing with problems involving
              massive graphs that arise in Internet computing and massive data sets.

A
              number of combinatorial problems on Internet infrastructures are examined,
              including the modeling and scaling of massive graphs using probabilistic
              analysis.  Of particular interest is the study of graphs with power law
              distributions that offer good approximations for realistic networks.  The
              evolution process of large dynamic graphs with only partial information is
              being analyzed and this has led to challenging problems and new research
              directions.
