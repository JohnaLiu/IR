Abstract    :
              The intrinsic structure and chemistry of nanotubes provide a framework upon
              which important functional nanoscale systems can be built.  At the University
              of Pennsylvania, we are discovered and produced hybrid materials in which
              molecules are introduced into the lumen of nanotubes to impart new and improved
              functionality.  The first of these was one-dimensional chains of C(60)
              molecules encapsulated in single-wall carbon nanotubes.  The molecules were
              shown to be highly mobile within the tubes and therefore provide an ideal basis
              for the experimental and theoretical study of one-dimensional systems.  We have
              recently shown that our synthesis methods are general and we have incorporated
              the alkali metals K and CS, and the endohedral molecule La(2)@C(60), inside of
              nanotubes.  This can lead to important results.  For example, calculations
              predict that the tensile modulus of nanotubes is greatly increased when they
              contain chains of C(60).  Also, there are possible applications of these
              systems to hydrogen storage and Li-based batteries.  An exciting prospect is
              the use of nanotubes as nanoscale reaction chambers to produce metastable
              molecules.

Our theory program first developed the intermolecular
              potentials among graphitic and fullerene structures and then applied
              one-dimensional statistical mechanics to analyze the clustering and
              one-dimensional equation of state of fullerene chains within nanotubes.
