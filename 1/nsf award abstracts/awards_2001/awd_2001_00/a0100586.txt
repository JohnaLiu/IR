Abstract    :
              The proposal concerns the investigation of motivic cohomology of
schemes and
              its relationships to algebraic K-theory. One part of the
project proposes an
              investigation of generically contractible sheaves.
The investigator intends to
              use the properties of such sheaves in
an attempt to show that Grayson motivic
              cohomology coincides with 
Voevodsky one and hence Graysons construction gives
              another
approach to the dvelopment of the motivic spectral sequence.
Another
              part of the project concerns the Friedlander-Milnor Conjecture.
The
              investigator expects to develop new methods for the proof
of the rigidity
              property for homology of the finite general
linear group. Finally the
              investigator plans to figure out
what if anything is missing in the proof of
              the Bloch-Kato Conjecture
modulo an arbitrary prime integer.

This research
              proposal is in the area of mathematics known as
algebraic geometry.  The
              objective of algebraic geometry is to
gain a deep understanding of the
              geometric properties of 
solutions to polynomial equations -- while everyone
              sees 
quadratic equations in school, equations of higher degree or
more
              variables become much more subtle.  Yet, because
computer and robot
              computations are inherently finite
approximations to the continuous "real
              world," understanding
polynomials is vital to such endeavors.
