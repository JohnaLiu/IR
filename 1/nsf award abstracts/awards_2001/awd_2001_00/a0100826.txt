Abstract    :
              The investigator together with Arizona State University is hosting
              the
Thirteenth International conference titled Formal Power Series
              and
Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC'01). This continuing series of
conferences
              bring together researchers from various areas of
combinatorics and theoretical
              computer science and links them with
leading scientists from allied
              disciplines in pure mathematics, applied
mathematics and physics. The focus of
              the 2001 conference is on
algebraic and enumerative combinatorics, again with
              emphasis on
interdisciplinary links to allied fields.

Topics include:
              formal power series and enumeration (e.g., enumerative
problems in physics),
              algebra and enumeration (e.g., combinatorial
methods in representation theory,
              association schemes),  topological and
geometric combinatorics (e.g.,
              arrangements of hyperplanes, Helly and
Tverberg type theorems, oriented
              matroids), probabilistic methods (e.g.,
extensions and refinements of Rodl
              method, randomized algorithms), poset
and graph theory (e.g., correlation and
              sorting, combinatorial approaches
to the algebraic aspects of correlation),
              extremal combinatorics (e.g.,
algebraic methods used to determine structural
              properties of extremal
objects).
