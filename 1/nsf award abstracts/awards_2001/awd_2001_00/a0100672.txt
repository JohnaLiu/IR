Abstract    :
              I intend over the next three years to understand how hybrid objects, made partly
              of configurations spaces and partly of bary-center spaces and/or of a
              collection of unstable manifolds of critical points arise in Yamabe-type
              problems as well as in contact form geometry.
I also would like to make out of
              the homology which I have defined for contact forms (on a space of dual
              Legendrian curves) a practical tool.

Singular solutions arise in a natural
              way in several fields of Science (Physics: Ginsburg - Landau, liquid crystals,
              biology, chemistry etc). Smooth solutions are variational solutions which also
              arise in a natural way, in the same fields, but through a different process
              (extremization of kinetic plus potential energy in Physics...) I intend to
              understand at least partly what are the bridges connecting these two
              processes.
