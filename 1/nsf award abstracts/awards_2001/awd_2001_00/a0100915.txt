This award to Skidaway Institute of Oceangraphy provides computer
              hardware and peripherals required to operate the NOAA Scientific Computer
              System (SCS v. 3.0) on the vessel Savannah, presently under construction, which
              will be operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
              System (UNOLS) research fleet.  This system will be used as the primary data
              acquisition system on the vessel, and will thus be a resource used by all
              scientific users of the vessel in their research during 2001 and future
              years.
