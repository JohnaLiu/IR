Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding for developing a methodology to study long-term
              capacity investment in a competitive electric market.  The objective is to
              study generation adequacy in relationship to the many complex factors in
              markets, such as load growth, market mechanisms, cost characteristics and
              physical limits of generating units, environmental policies, and competition. 
              Specifically, three main goals will be targeted: (1) Develop a real-options
              based, long-term generation asset valuation tool, and use it to evaluate
              capacity investment decisions. (2) Develop theoretic results to define the
              "optimal capacity expansion," including the investment timing and the
              generator's type and size in a well-defined, deregulated environment.  (3)
              Develop a model that simulates generation capacity expansion process in the
              competitive electric power a model that simulates generation capacity expansion
              process in the competitive electric power 
industry, and use the model to
              study capacity expansion related problems, and forecast generation adequacy and
              electricity price trend.  If successful, given a well-defined market
              environment, the model will be used to forecast the probability distributions
              for electricity price and system capacity at each future time period and the
              probability of blackouts as well.  This forecasting model will help to detect
              unforeseeable problems related to generation adequacy, and to serve as an early
              warning system.
