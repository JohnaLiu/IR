It has been shown
              previously that in the presence of colloidal particles, the wetting region is
              comprised of the bulk fluid with the meniscus and the transition region leading
              to a thin film of structured colloidal particles.  Experiments with similarly
              charged monodispersed latex particles show co-existence of ordered-disordered
              particle structures, depending on the film thickness relative to the particle
              diameter.  Since the particles are similarly charged, there must be some form
              of long-range attractive force responsible for creating the ordered structure. 
              Microintereferometric methods are proposed to be used to measure the film
              thickness profile and to calculate the capillary pressure near the contact
              line.  The effect of volume fraction, particle size, shape and polydispersity
              on the film structure and stability will be investigated by direct observation
              of the ordered microstructure within the thin film near the contact line.  The
              structural disjoining pressure will be calculated from the particle radial
              distribution function and the mean potential of particle interactions.  The
              contact angle is calculated from experimentally measured values of the
              capillary pressure and the calculated disjoining pressure.
