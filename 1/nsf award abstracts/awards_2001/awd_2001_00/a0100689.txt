Abstract    :
              
This award will support a research effort aimed at measuring the
angular
              correlation between neutron spin and the emission direction
of the electron
              following beta decay of the neutron.  The experiment
will utilize ultra-cold
              neutrons at the Los Alamos Neutron Science
Center.  The goal is ultimately to
              provide an order-of-magnitude in
the precision to which this asymmetry is
              known.  This measurment,
coupled with ongoing measurements of the neutron
              lifetime, can
provide sensitive tests of the electroweak standard model, as
              well
as improved values of the weak axial form factor of the nucleon. 
The
              research effort contains an exceptionally diverse collection of
nuclear and
              atomic experimental techniques, at a scale where a Ph.D. student can have a
              substantial impact upon the course of the
research.
