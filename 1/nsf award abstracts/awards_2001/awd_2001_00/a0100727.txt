Abstract    :
              This research investigates the generation and synthetic applications of
              short-lived reactive intermediates, including 1,3-dipoles,
              ortho-quinodimethanes, alpha-keto carbocations, beta-trimethylsilyl- and
              beta-alkoxy-substituted carbocations.  Both electrochemical and chemical means
              will be utilized to generate the intermediates.  The use of microemulsions
              and/or ionic liquids may prove to have advantages over classical solvents as
              media for organic electrochemical reactions.  In addition, there is a potential
              benefit to society if new "green" electrochemical methods are realized from
              this research.

With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Professor Albert J. Fry in the
              Department of Chemistry at Wesleyan University.  Professor Fry's research
              investigates the generation and reactivity of a number of short-lived organic
              intermediates.  In particular, the proposed electrocatalytic regeneration of
              hydrogen iodide as a reducing agent and the electrocatalytic oxidation has the
              potential to lead to the development of new, environmentally friendly
              reactions.  These reactions could become new environmentally benign and
              efficient industrial processes.
