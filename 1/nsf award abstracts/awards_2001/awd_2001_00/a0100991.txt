Abstract    :
              This award supports a project of Professor Shokurov. The project
is focused on
              the finite generatedness of algebras--
a fundamental problem of algebra. The
              work proposed is 
to resolve the problem in a certain important class
              of
algebras (named (FGA)) with the aim to finish the proof 
of the existence
              of log flips in any dimension 
whenever the Log Minimal Model Program (LMMP)
              
and, in particular, the log terminations hold in 
the lower dimensions. To
              apply this inductive step 
to the LMMP in dimensions higher than 4
the
              principal investigator intends to finish the log termination 
for 4-folds.
              This gives the 5-fold log flips, and establishes 
the LMMP in dimension 4. A
              concrete application of this technique
will be done by his student, Jihun
              Park, in his study of birational 
geometry of Del Pezzo fibre spaces, with a
              view to their existence, 
uniqueness of their certain models, and to the
              birational classification. 

This is research in the field of algebra with
              methods and applications 
in algebraic geometry. The finite generatedness
              corresponds to
completeness in geometry, and effectiveness from the
              computational point 
of view. Algebra and algebraic geometry are very old,
              traditional areas of 
modern mathematics, but which have had a revolutionary
              flowering in 
the past century. In its origin, algebraic geometry
treated
              figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest
equations, namely
              polynomials, or be given in the 3-space by the simplest
geometric
              constructions, e. g., conic sections.
Algebra is about these equations. Both
              fields interacts with most of 
branches of mathematics, e.g., analysis,
              topology and
mathematical physics, with applications in those
fields as well
              as in number theory, physics, theoretical computer science,
and robotics.
