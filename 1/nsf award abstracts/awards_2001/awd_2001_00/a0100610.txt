Quigg/Kaliszewski

This is a proposal for the ninth West Coast
              Operator Algebra Seminar (WCOAS),to be
held at Arizona State University on
              October 20 -21,2001.  The WCOAS is a decade-long tradition among the operator
              algebraists in the western United States.  The Seminar provides an invaluable
              opportunity for these researchers to stay abreast of their field, fosters and
              reinforces ties among the western universities, and provides
young researchers
              with a forum in which to present their latest results and discuss them with
              senior mathematicians.  The high concentration of operator algebraists in the
              western United States and Canada has been one of the main reasons for the
              success of the WCOAS.
