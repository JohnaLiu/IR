Abstract    :
              The Vision Cone Penetrometer (VisCPT) is an electronic cone penetrometer
              containing two miniature CCD video cameras.  The cameras collect a continuous
              stream of images of a soil stratigraphy at two levels of magnification as the
              probe is advanced vertically through a soil.  The VisCPT delineates soil types
              and through computer image processing it facilitates very high-resolution
              stratigraphic characterization of a site.  The present research effort will
              consist of three parts: Development of standard indices for soil grain size
              based on the power spectra of wavelet-transformed images; Modifications to the
              existing VisCPT instrumentation including adaptation of color cameras and
              real-time digital image acquisition; and field data collection at the National
              Geotechnical Experimentation (NGES) site on Treasure Island in San Francisco.
              The collected VisCPT data will be evaluated with specific focus on
              image-texture and wavelet transform techniques for determining soil type.
              Continuous high quality piston tube soil samples will be taken for comparison
              to VisCPT results.  The VisCPT images will also be compared to standard
              piezocone (uCPT) test results to illustrate and quantify the effects of thin
              strata on uCPT readings.  It is anticipated that the modifications to the
              VisCPT will substantially enhance the ability of geotechnical engineers to
              characterize a site, especially with regard to the identification and location
              of thin strata.  This will lead to significant improvement in predictions of
              liquefaction potential, settlement rates and other critical behaviors.
