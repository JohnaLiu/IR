Abstract    :
              In joint work with Sergiu Klainerman and John Stalker,
we study the decay rate,
              pointwise and uniform, of solutions
to a linear wave equation on a
              Schwarzschild background metric.
We have preliminary results for each
              spherical harmonic.
This is the first step towards understanding the
              non-linear stability
of these metrics.

Roughly speaking, this corresponds
              to the propagation and decay of an
electromagnetic wave near a black hole. Our
              work starts with a careful
mathematical analysis of ideas known to physicists,
              and plans to
develop new tools.
