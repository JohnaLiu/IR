Abstract    :
              The first part of the proposed work concerns Monge-Ampere equations, including
              extensions of classical  results of Jorgens, Calabi and Pogorelov which state
              that entire solutions to such equations are quadratic polynomials. Dirichlet
              problem for Monge-Ampere equations in exterior domains of Euclidean space will
              also be investigated. Related problems concerning the affine Bernstein problem
              will  be studied. The second part of the proposed work concerns best Sobolev
              inequality on Riemannian manifolds and the Yamabe problem on manifolds with
              boundary.
This includes efforts in establishing a new form of best Sobolev
              inequalities on Riemannian manifolds as well as existence and compactness
              results  concerning the Yamabe problem on manifolds with boundary. Sharp
              pointwise estimates to blow up solutions play important roles in such
              studies.

The role of mathematical analysis is not so  much to create the
              equations as it is to create qualitative and quantitative  information about
              the solutions. This may include answers to questions about existence,
              uniqueness, smoothness, and growth.
 In addition, analysis often develops
              methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on the accuracy of these
              approximations.
