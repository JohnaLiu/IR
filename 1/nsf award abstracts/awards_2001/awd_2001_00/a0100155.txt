ABSTRACT CMS0100155 "Hurricane Andrew 10
              Years Later: Implications for Disaster Mitigation"


Due to the extensive
              losses, Hurricane Andrew is widely recognized as a watershed event, placing
              disaster resistance and mitigation visibly on the political agenda. The
              ultimate goal of this project is to inform national mitigation efforts through
              an assessment of the extent to which vulnerabilities evident prior to or
              emerging after this major disaster remain nearly 10 years later.

This
              project focuses on several dimensions of community and household status as they
              relate to disaster vulnerability and resilience. At the community level, this
              project will: 1) Document changes in demographics, economic and business base,
              and political structure looking at those areas directly impacted and the rest
              of Miami-Dade County; 2) Determine the extent to which the policies and
              practices instituted during reconstruction resulted in increased disaster
              resilience of the community; 3) Analyze whether there have been any lasting
              improvements in the political power of previously marginalized groups; 4)
              Compare the recovery levels of various sections within the impacted region and
              explore possible explanations for any found differences. On the household
              level, the focus will be twofold: 1) to assess the vulnerability-related status
              of the "Families of Andrew"; and 2) to assess the current disaster resistance
              of households county-wide. A primary focus will be decisions regarding housing,
              shutters, insurance, and risk planning and preparation in general. 

The
              findings from this milestone project will make a major contribution to the
              field and to a safer nation. A clearer understanding of community and household
              issues associated with long-term recovery from a major disaster in a diverse
              metropolitan area will result in more effective models of disaster mitigation
              and response.
