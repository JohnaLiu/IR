Abstract    :
              The investigator continues to study general decomposable forms. 
In particular,
              he seeks
better bounds
for the number of primitive integral solutions to
              non-degenerate decomposable
form equations and also stronger
              asymptotic
results for the number of integral solutions
to the related
              inequality.
In addition, the investigator studies the
absolute Siegel's lemma
               and the related
Hermite's   
constant over the algebraic numbers. The main
              goal here is an effective
version of the former and improved upper bounds for
              the latter.

The decomposable form equations dealt with here are examples
              of
Diophantine equations. These have been studied for millennia.
Long thought
              to be mere intellectual curiosities, it is
now realized that knowledge in this
              area is crucial in our
``digital" age. Much of cryptography, coding, and data
              exchange rests
on the ability, or lack thereof, to find solutions to such
              equations.
Siegel's lemma and Hermite's constant are intimately connected
              with
sphere packings, finite groups
and 
error-correcting codes, and via
              these to many disparate areas of
science.
