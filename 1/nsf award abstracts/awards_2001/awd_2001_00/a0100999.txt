Abstract    :
              Given geographical constraints, the ability of humans to be aware of or
              establish contact with others falls off rapidly with physical distance. 
              Indeed, problems as diverse as the spread of disease within human populations,
              the diffusion of cultural norms, migration, racial/ethnic segregation, and
              susceptibility to panic or revolution have all been linked to the
              distance-based structure of human relations.  Yet, this spatial element of
              social network formation has received little attention.  This project therefore
              develops mathematical network models based on physical distance, evaluates
              competing network models using published data on interpersonal relations across
              space, and presents measures of network structures.  Using simulation methods,
              it identifies the linkages between large-scale social processes, such as those
              described above, and the social networks that span social groups and
              organizations. The mathematical methods thus provide insights into the general
              structures of human interaction that shape the more specific experiences and
              behaviors of individuals in a variety of types of groups.
