Abstract    :
              The proposer is going to study a number of interconnected combinatorial problems
              related, on the one hand, to exact or asymptotic enumeration of branched
              coverings of one surface by another and, on the other hand, to exact or
              asymptotic evaluation of various sums over partitions.  These problems arise
              both from enumerative geometry of the moduli spaces of curves (and related
              moduli spaces) and from connection with random matrices.  If solved, these
              problems will lead to important applications to algebraic geometry, ergodic
              theory, and other fields, and will also substantially further our present
              understanding of the interaction between geometry of the moduli spaces and
              combinatorics of random matrices and partitions.
