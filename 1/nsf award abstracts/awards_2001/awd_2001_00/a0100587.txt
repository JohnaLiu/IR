Abstract    :
                  This proposal concerns questions in higher dimensional Arakelov theory
              and
algebraic K-theory.  The PI intends to extend results of previous work
              with
Soule on motivic weight complexes of algebraic varities to the arithmetic
              case.
In collaboration with J. Hu, he intends to use the deformation to the
              normal
cone techniquess for Arakelov theory (developed by J. Hu in his thesis)
              to the
case of stacks.  He also intends to study questions in arithmetic
              geometry
related to the Mordell conjecture using methods from differential
              algebra and
Arakelov theory.

     This proposal deals with arithmetic
              geometry and algebraic K-theory.
Arithmetic geometry is the study of the
              properties of equations with
coefficients that are whole numbers, and using
              methods both from number
theory (the study of properties of whole numbers) and
              algebraic geometry, which
studies geometric figures that can be defined by the
              simplest of equations,
namely polynomials. Algebraic K-theory studies
              properties of linear equations
using methods from geometry.  The questions and
              phenomena which arise from
combining number theory and geometry serve as
              driving forces in much of
contemporary mathematics research. Moreover,
              arithemetic geometry has
contributed to many applications including
              cryptography and theoretical
computer science.
