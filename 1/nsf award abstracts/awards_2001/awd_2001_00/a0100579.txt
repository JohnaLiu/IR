The PI proposes to
              explore the effect of entanglement density on polymer dynamics in terms of
              damping function, time-strain factorability, and orientation angle.  The
              investigation will include experiments to identify nonlinear rheological
              characteristics of entangled polymer systems in shear and extensional flows. 
              Furthermore, experiments will be designed to examine aspects of specific
              molecular scale phenomenon in the nonlinear polymer flow behavior.  Based on
              the information obtained, molecular-based constitutive equations will be
              developed.
