Abstract    :
              This proposal grows from the PI's  recent discovery that important elements of
              Faraday's 1856 investigation  into gold -- a large set of microscope slides and
              other laboratory materials -- still exist in a well-preserved state at the
              Royal Institution in London.  The combination of laboratory materials with the
              more traditional written documentation from the scientist's notebooks presents
              an important opportunity for cognitive scientists to understand even more
              thoroughly the work of Faraday -- and scientific work more generally.

The
              proposal requests SGER support for travel to England so that the PI can
              undertake certain technical work related to the slides and other laboratory
              materials before undertaking a more detailed scholarly examination of the
              entire set of experiments by Faraday.  Primarily, Tweney seeks assistance to
              enable him to photographically reproduce and catalogue the microscope slides. 
              He also wants to examine and study the chemical materials and processes that
              Faraday used, some of which survives as well.  From this preliminary work, a
              more complete exploration of Faraday's gold research can be undertaken by the
              P.I. in the United States.
