Abstract    :
              The proposed work would continue and deepen the work of the Northern New Mexico
              Network's first five years, which has been primarily devoted to increasing the
              capacity of teachers in 22 public school districts to understand, adopt, and
              implement standards-based instructional practices, based on the New Mexico
              State Standards, as well as hands-on science and math instruction.             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                  The goals of the project are:                                              
                                                                                             
                    1. Implementation of a comprehensive MST standards-based curriculum      
                                                                    2. High quality teacher
              and administrator professional development program.                            
                                      3. Convergence of resources in support of increased
              student achievement in MST.                                               4.
              Development of a comprehensive assessment and accountability system.           
                                                            5. Sustaining reform strategies. 
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
                                                                            The scope of work
              will involve use of the Leadership Development for School Teams as the primary
              professional development vehicle for school administrators and the master
              teachers.  The master teachers, termed Circuit Riders, will be assigned
              mentoring responsibilities in specific schools, and are in essence the field
              operation of the effort.
