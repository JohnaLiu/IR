Abstract    :
              Although sterility in hybrids between species has been documented  repeatedly,
              its genetic causes are poorly understood, and only one gene that may contribute
              directly to hybrid sterility has been identified.  Hybrid sterility may be
              caused by genes failing to trigger other genes in what are referred to as
              "regulatory pathways", hence ultimately disrupting the processes that produce
              functional sperm.  We propose to use a novel method to identify which genes are
              active in two Drosophila species but inactive in their hybrids, hence
              identifying the regulatory pathways that have been disrupted resulting in
              sterility.

Modern evolutionary biologists have an impressive understanding
              of how genes evolve within populations, but a relatively poor understanding of
              how one species splits into two, as when their hybrids are sterile. This
              research will illuminate the mechanisms of speciation, providing insights into
              the fundamental evolutionary processes that regulate biodiversity on earth.
