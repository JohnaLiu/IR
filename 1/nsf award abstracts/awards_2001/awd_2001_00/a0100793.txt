Astronomy Research at
              the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory

The Five College Radio
              Astronomy Observatory at the University of Massachusetts is a group of
              scientists and engineers who work together in support of a research program in
              millimeter-wave astronomy. The FCRAO program emphasizes three principal areas:
              (1) astronomical research; (2) development of state-of-the-art instrumentation;
              and (3) training of graduate and undergraduate students in observational
              astronomy and astronomical instrumentation. The program is currently known for
              its operation of a 14m diameter millimeter-wave telescope in Massachusetts.
              However, in order to remain at the forefront of research, the Observatory is
              participating with the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica, Optica, y
              Electronica (INAOE) in the construction, in Mexico, of a 50m diameter Large
              Millimeter Telescope (LMT), to be completed in 2004. The research to be
              undertaken involves continued operations of the FCRAO 14m telescope for
              scientific observations, and the initial stages of transition to the new
              facility.  The latter includes development and testing of new LMT
              instrumentation (a wide-band correlator, a 1mm SIS receiver, a wavefront
              sensing system for pointing corrections, and a holography system), and work on
              antenna monitor and control systems.
