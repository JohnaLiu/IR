Abstract    :
              There are two main topics of research in this proposal, first, the
large time
              behaviour and scattering theory of nonlinear Schrodinger
waves off a potential
              term which supports many bound states. This leads
to the analysis of
              multichannel nonlinear scattering and metastability
of hamiltonian dispersive
              equations. The second topic involves the study of
radiation damping for
              metastable mutltibreather solutions of the wave
equation. The large time
              behaviour of the linearized wave equation around
multibreather solutions is
              analyzed; a theory to estimate the lifetimes
of perturbed multibreather
              solutions is developed and applications
to nonlinear optics, in particular
              optical guides with non-uniform diffraction
profiles.

The use of optical
              devices and fibers in today's communication systems
motivates some of the
              problems studied in this proposal. In particular
we concentrate on the problem
              of effects of defects and other irregularities
in optical fibers on their
              transport properties. We also analyze some
novel optical devices made by
              modifying the medium in a way to achieve
better filtering of noise and
              interchannel interference.
