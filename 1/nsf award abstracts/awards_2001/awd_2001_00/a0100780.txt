Abstract    :
              The project is aimed at developing a quantitative model for high temperature
              creep of dispersion strengthened aluminum alloys (Al-Sc-Mg-Zr-SiC) by
              integrating the dislocation dissociation and positive climb concepts. An
              innovative creep specimen geometry will elucidate the threshold stress
              mechanisms and the microstructural evolution during creep deformation. An
              understanding of the influence of particle size and distribution on threshold
              stress and creep kinetics can lead to development of high temperature aluminum
              alloys by microstructural design. The development of quantitative model based
              on fundamental dislocation parameters is in dire need. Major goals of the study
              are: (1) to investigate the deformation characteristics in simpler alloy
              systems (Al-Sc, Al-Zr, etc) for a systematic understanding of their mechanical
              behavior; (2) to perform in-situ transmission electron microscope (TEM)
              straining experiments for determining dislocation velocities during their glide
              and climb movements; and (3) to develop quantitative model using the
              experimentally determined parameters. The work involves a combination of
              university-industry-government laboratory-national user facility.

This
              research develops new understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of dispersion
              strengthening beyond the current state of the art. The results are aimed at the
              development of creep-resistant materials for high-temperature applications in
              various technologies.
