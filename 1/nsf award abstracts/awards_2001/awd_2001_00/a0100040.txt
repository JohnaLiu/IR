Abstract    :
              Theory revision is the correcting of a given, roughly correct rule,
also known
              as a concept or theory.  This problem arises frequently in
machine learning,
              for instance, when the initial output of an 
expert system is not correct, and
              when the machine learning
problem is too large or too complex to solve from
              scratch, and an
approximately correct rule is needed to jump-start the
              learning
process.  There has been considerable ad hoc building of theory
              
revision systems, but the theory is poorly understood.  This
              research
investigates fundamental mathematical possibilities and
              limitations
of efficient theory revision.  It is hoped that as a result
              of
this research, theory revision in computational learning theory
              will
emerge as a general framework for the study of learning situations
where
              a large amount of initial information is available or
necessary.  

In
              particular, the PIs investigate the following areas:  extensions
of their
              previous work on propositional logic theory revision
with queries, relations
              to certificate complexity and
attribute-efficient learning, revision problems
              for predicate logic
representations, and both the learning and revising of
              categorial 
grammars.
