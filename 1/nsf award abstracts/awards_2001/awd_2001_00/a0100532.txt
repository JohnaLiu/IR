Abstract    :
                 The nervous and endocrine systems play a critical role in allowing organisms
              to cope with environmental stressors.  Recent studies on non-mammalian species
              have identified responses to stress that have adaptive features that do not fit
              readily into current views, largely based on laboratory animals, that stress is
              a disorder.  This symposium brings together for the first time scientists
              specifically working on chemical signaling during stress in mammalian and
              non-mammalian animals.  The symposium will cover the phylogenetic diversity of
              the stress response in invertebrates and vertebrates, the comparative aspects
              of how mechanisms for responses show specific adaptations, and the integration
              of how stress responses function in development, reproduction, immune function,
              and behavior.  The symposium itself takes an integrative approach from
              molecules to behavior, over a wide range of organisms, and is a satellite
              meeting to the similarly broad Society for Integrative & Comparative Biology. 
              Papers will be presented by graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, as
              well as senior researchers, and the proceedings will be published an
              international journal.
    This symposium will have an impact by giving a
              unique perspective on a topic of broad interest to animal physiology as well as
              to neuroscience and behavior, and the exposure of young scientists to these
              ideas and to interactions with leaders in the field will have an impact on
              their careers.
