Abstract    :
              The project will develop quantitative tools to analyze the large-scale tracer
              transport in both models and the atmosphere. Numerical models of atmospheric
              chemistry and transport are being increasingly used to understand the
              interactions between various atmospheric regions, e.g., between troposphere and
              stratosphere, and the Tropics and midlatitudes. Since trace gases do not
              directly impact atmospheric motion, they reveal the movement of air parcels.
              The climatological pathways of the air parcels and the dynamical mechanisms
              determining the pathways are not known with great certainty at this time. Dr.
              Bowman will develop a diagnostic tool for analyzing tracer transport, by
              estimating the Green's (or influence) function for the tracer conservation
              equation. Dr. Bowman will construct this function from particle trajectories
              computed from observed (reanalysis) and NCAR Community Climate Model simulated
              winds. Bowman's project is unique in view of its focus on transport dynamics of
              the troposphere (as opposed to the stratosphere).
