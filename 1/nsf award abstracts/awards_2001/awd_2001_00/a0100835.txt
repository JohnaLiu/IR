This US-Chile award will provide support for cooperative
              research to Dr. Sergio Rodriguez of Purdue University to work with Dr. Zdenka
              Berticevic of Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria and Dr. Monica Pacheco
              of Universidad de Santiago in Chile on theoretical studies of extended and
              localized electronic states in semiconductors and their low dimensional
              structures.
The project will attempt to develop a theoretical understanding of
              recent experiments with diamond dopands that should have implications for the
              development of wide band-gap semiconductors useful in many electronic devices. 
              The collaborators will investigate the production of quantum dots in
              semiconductors making use of complementary facilities and tools at their
              respective institutions.
