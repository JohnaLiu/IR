Abstract    :
              This award will help obtain annual-to-decadal resolution records of abrupt
              climate change preserved in varved and finely laminated fossiliferous lake
              sediments from western and southern Europe.  Stratigraphic sections in Pianico,
              Italy, archived cores from Grande Pile, France, and new cores from Bispingen
              and Krumbach, Germany and Ribains, France will be examined using multiple
              biotic (i.e., pollen, diatoms) and abiotic (i.e., clay and silica mineralogy,
              magnetic susceptibility) climate proxies to obtain high-resolution signals of
              atmospheric cooling at the end of the last interglacial period.  Such records
              will provide new insights into the physical mechanism underlying the transition
              from warm to cool climatic conditions at the last interglacial
              transition.

Furthermore, these terrestrial records will be compared with
              marine records to investigate the validity of the conceptual model that links
              persistent warm low-middle latitude sea-surface temperatures in the Northern
              Hemisphere with concurrent decreasing temperatures and sea ice formation at
              higher northern latitudes. 

In the process of developing new data, ideas,
              and insights surrounding abrupt climate change, the research will also help
              develop new collaborations with international colleagues working in this
              intellectual area and enhance the sharing of scientific data and ideas.
