Abstract    :
              This university-industry collaborative research project seeks to advance the
              capability for the manufacture of crystalline surfaces for use in short
              wavelength light emitters (blue/UV LEDs and lasers) by contributing to a basic
              understanding of the generation of defects resultant from the processing of ZnO
              substrates, and the subsequent homoepitaxial growth of films.  ZnO substrates
              will be prepared by chemomechanical polishing and further pre-growth processing
              techniques, after which homoepitaxial films will be grown on the substrates. 
              The defects generated at various stages of surface processing will be examined
              with high energy backscattering spectrometry, ion channeling and scanning
              electrical properties microscopy.  

This understanding will aid in
              identifying the processing conditions which show promise for producing
              ultra-high quality epitaxial films on ZnO.  Development of this understanding
              has the potential to contributing to the successful demonstration of the
              homoepitaxial growth of ZnO.  This work will further contribute to the
              development of advanced surface characterization tools which are needed for
              assessing near surface damage at the nanometer scale.  An extensive
              collaborative effort involving Oklahoma State University, Eagle-Picher
              Technologies and Los Alamos National Laboratory will be undertaken.
