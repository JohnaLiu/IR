Abstract    :
              The PI and his collaborators have shown that the method of factorizing the
              operator exp[-dt(T+V)] to fourth order with purely positive coefficients, which
              has produced superior symplectic integrators for solving classical dynamical
              problems, has also yielded excellent numerical algorithms for solving the
              time-dependent Schroedinger equation, the Fokker-Plank equation, the Kramers
              equation, and the imaginary time Schroedinger equation. The latter has resulted
              in a number of new fourth order Diffusion Monte Carlo algorithms. These new
              algorithms require knowing the potential and the gradient of the potential. The
              fourth order error coefficients of these new algorithms are orders of magnitude
              smaller then those of the existing split operator (second-order) method and can
              produce converged results using time steps 10-50 times as large. This operator
              factorization approach suggests a new class of more efficient algorithms for
              solving diverse quantum many-body and dynamical problems in nuclear, condensed
              matter and atomic physics. This proposal seeks to develop further fourth order
              algorithms for solving large scale, grid based, Hartree-Fock, Kohn-Sham and
              Gross-Pitaevskii equations in arbitrary three-dimensional geometry.
