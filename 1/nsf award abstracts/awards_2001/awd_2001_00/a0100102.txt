Abstract    :
              We propose to study low-energy nuclear reactions, most related to
              nuclear
astrophysics, using short-lived secondary beams of  6-He, 8-Li, 7-Be,
              8-B,
and other nuclei.  These will be used to study nuclear reactions related
              to
the apparent deficit of solar neutrinos, and the "missing mass" problem
              in
the Universe.  The experiments will utilize a unique UM-developed
              apparatus
consisting of two large superconducting magnets and will continue
              further
technical developments of the device, which also has applications in
              other
fields such as nuclear medicine.  Additional related experimental work,
              as
funding permits, will be done at the National Superconducting
              Cyclotron
Laboratory (E. Lansing, MI), and the Texas AM Cyclotron
              Laboratory.
