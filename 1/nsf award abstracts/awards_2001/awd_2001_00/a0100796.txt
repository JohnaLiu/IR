Abstract    :
              Over the past two years I have been working on multi-linear 
singular integral
              operators. Recently, in a joint work with T.Tao and
C.Thiele we generalized
              the previous results on the bilinear Hilbert
transform to the case of
              multilinear operators with much more singular
symbols.
 The striking fact
              about these developments is that it seems that these
techniques could have a
              very nice and important application to the
spectral theory of Schroedinger
              operators.
 The final goal of our project, is to show that for the
              classical
Schroedinger operators with square integrable potential and for
              almost
every positive eigenvalue, their corresponding eigenfunctions are
              bounded.
 The answer to the above conjecture would imply a better
              understanding
of the behaviour of the Schroedinger operators, which lie in the
              heart of
Quantum Mechanics.
