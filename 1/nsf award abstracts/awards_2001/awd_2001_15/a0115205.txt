Abstract    :
              The research objective of this grant is to develop scientific techniques for
              digital transformation of computer generated mechanical designs with spatially
              optimized topology, geometry, material composition and properties directly into
              physical realizations of functional mechanisms.  This objective will be
              accomplished by developing two key components: (1) a design methodology for
              automated, computer aided design synthesis of compliant systems that are
              spatially optimized with respect to function, form and material composition;
              and (2) a methodology for automated, solid freeform fabrication of such systems
              with true, three-dimensional material heterogeneity.

If successful, this
              project will pioneer the integrated design and fabrication of heterogeneous,
              multi-functional, compliant systems. The design algorithms to be developed as
              part of this project will introduce a new way of designing complex mechanisms.
              They will allow the designer to develop designs optimized not only with respect
              to geometric, topological and kinematic considerations, but also with spatially
              optimized material composition and properties. The fabrication methods
              developed in this project will enable the construction of multi-material,
              multi-functional compliant systems that cannot be fabricated by any other
              manufacturing methods. This is a unique marriage of digital design and digital
              fabrication. Therefore, this project provides a seamless integration of design
              synthesis, selective material deposition and freeform fabrication.
