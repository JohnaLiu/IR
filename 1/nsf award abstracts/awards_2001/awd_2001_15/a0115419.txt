Abstract    :
              
In this project a program of individualized, computer-aided reading
              instruction will be implemented and assessed.  The computer-aided reading
              instruction is based on two classes of tools - one based on speech and
              animation technology and the other on language comprehension technology. An
              example of the former tool is Vocabulary Tutor which focuses on decoding
              practices. It includes a 3D animated talking head synchronized with recorder or
              synthesized speech, paired with illustrations and printed words that can be
              entered by the teacher or the child. Children look at the images, listen to the
              words, see their spelling, pronounce them, and receive feedback. An example of
              the second kind is Summary Street. Summary Street is based on a statistical
              theory of meaning, latent semantic analysis. Children write summaries, Summary
              Street automatically compares their summaries with the text they are
              summarizing and provides feedback about the content and the adequacy of their
              summaries.  These tools are  classroom tested. This project extends the
              foundation of technology and application development to a comprehensive reading
              program called Colorado Literacy Tutor that will be tested throughout the state
              of Colorado after testing in the Boulder School district.
