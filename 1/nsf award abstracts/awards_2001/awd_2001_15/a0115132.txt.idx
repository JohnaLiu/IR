Abstract    :
              The enzymes produced by fungi that degrade the pectic components of plant cell
              walls are central to fungal pathogenicity. Two of these classes of enzymes,
              endopolygalacturonases (EPGs) and pectin methylesterases (PMEs), are the focus
              of this project. Fungi produce EPGs to hydrolyze the cell wall polysaccharide
              homogalacturonan as one of the first steps in invasion. Pectin methylesterases
              (PMEs) often act in concert with EPGs by converting methyl-esterified regions
              of homogalacturonan to a substrate which is susceptible to the EPG. One of
              plant defense mechanisms involves the interactions between fungal EPGs and
              plant-derived polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs), that reduce the
              hydrolytic activity of the EPG. The ability of PMEs and EPGs to modify and
              fragment homogalacturonan, respectively, has led to their exploitation in a
              variety of commercial applications, including the clarification of juices, the
              texture and firmness of processed foods and purees, and control of the rheology
              of pectins as gelling agents.   Little is known about the mechanism of action
              of EPGs and PMEs, despite their economic importance to both industry and
              agriculture. To increase our knowledge of EPGs and PMEs, this project will use
              amide exchange-mass spectrometry to identify the sites on both EPG and PME that
              bind to their respective substrates. This technique will also be used to
              investigate the sites of protein/protein interaction between EPG and its
              inhibitor protein (PGIP). The information obtained from the initial experiments
              will identify amino acids of EPG and PME that appear to be critical to these
              interactions with the substrate (and in the case of EPG with PGIP). Based on
              these data, site-specific replacements will be designed to potentially disrupt
              interactions. Amide exchange-MS will then be used to determine if the resulting
              change in amino acid(s) has disrupted the binding interaction under
              investigation. Besides obtaining the information on the binding surfaces on the
              mutant enzymes, the project will also investigate if changes to the binding
              site of PME alter the products of this enzyme. This will be done by a
              comparison of the products of native PME action on short, methyl esterified
              pectic fragments to the products of a series of site-specific mutant forms of
              the PME on the same substrates.   The detailed characterization of the
              protein/protein and protein/carbohydrate interactions in this project will
              provide added insight into mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions, and new
              avenues for increasing plant disease resistance. This knowledge will provide
              information on fruit ripening and plant development, and will be of great
              benefit in the design and selection of overexpressed enzymes to meet specific
              industrial requirements.
