This dissertation enhancement grant supports a US graduate
              student, Ms. Renee Richer, working under the guidance of Professor Fakhri
              Bazzaz, with the Department of Organismic & Evolutionary Biology at Harvard
              University, to conduct a study in Zimbabwe on the mechanisms that control the
              timing of leaf emergence.

The timing of leaf flush and fall (leaf phenology)
              can have significant impacts on rural economies, groundwater supplies, the
              global carbon budget, and plant and animal diversity.  But in tropical savannas
              the cues that regulate leaf phenology are not that well understood.  Dry
              tropical woodlands are a source of food for humans and domestic livestock and
              are also home to some of the world's most endangered wildlife, which may be
              significantly impacted by changes in seasonal forage.  Ms. Richer is testing a
              novel hypothesis that fluctuating levels of stored carbohydrates regulate
              patterns of leaf flush in the dry woodlands of Zimbabwe.  She will also test
              whether changes in the carbohydrates, as a result of elevated atmospheric
              carbon, induce phenological change.  Dr. Robson Mhuriro, in the Indigenous
              Resources Department with the Forestry Commission of Zimbabwe, will provide
              guidance on this project to Ms. Richer.

The results of this study will
              increase the current knowledge about the basic dynamics of dry woodlands and
              the potential effects of global change.  This project will also support an
              international research experience very early in the career of an outstanding
              graduate student.
