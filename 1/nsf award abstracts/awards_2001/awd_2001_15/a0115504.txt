              Lay Abstract for "Characterization of a Candidate Sweet Taste Receptor"

The
              objective of the proposed research is to elucidate the function of a novel
              protein, T1R3, which is present on the surface of taste buds in mice and
              humans.  The discovery of the T1R3 gene at the chromosomal locus associated
              with saccharin sensitivity in mice suggests that the T1R3 protein may be (a
              receptor) involved in the detection of sugars and sweeteners.  To gain insight
              into the potential role of T1R3 in taste, the co-localization in taste bud
              cells of the T1R3 protein with other proteins believed to be involved in taste
              will be examined.  In individual taste cells, the co-localization of messenger
              RNAs (mRNAs) encoding T1R3 and other candidate taste tranduction proteins will
              also be studied.  It is anticipated that this knowledge gained from this
              research will lead to a better understanding of how taste signal transduction
              occurs.  In addition, this research may provide important information towards
              the development of improved non-caloric sweeteners and effective therapies for
              taste disorders.
