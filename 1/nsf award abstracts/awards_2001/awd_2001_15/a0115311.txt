Description:  This award supports U.S.-India cooperative
              research entitled "Novel Approaches to Quantum Modeling of Chemical Systems. 
              Professors Thomas Cundari, University of Memphis and Shankar Bhattacharyya,
              Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science will collaborate on
              developing genetic algorithms for use in molecular modeling.  Novel soft
              computing techniques - genetic algorithms, neural networks, and fuzzy logic -
              for solving the Schroedinger wave equation for chemical systems will be
              developed, refined and implemented.  Further development and application of
              such algorithms are important in creating efficient computation of molecular
              properties in realistic systems.

Scope:  The international collaboration
              will exploit the synergy between the US and Indian research groups.  The
              expertise of the Indian team in algorithm development and genetic algorithms
              will complement the US team's strengths in other branches of soft computing and
              the chemical applications.  This project will promote mutual benefits with
              respect to scientific exchange and graduate student development.  The project
              is jointly supported by the Division of International Programs and the
              Government of India's Department of Science and Technology.
