Abstract    :
              
This planning proposal funds the design a study on the influence of
              information and computer technology based learning activities on the social
              behavior and academic achievement of urban, impoverished, minority children. 
              The project will use an ongoing collaboration with the St. Louis Public Schools
              and an ongoing project that introduces technology to children in primary
              grades. The work envisions the use of technology in support of appropriate
              behavior and learning in primary (pre-K through 2nd grade) classrooms. The work
              capitalizes upon on-going efforts to both study and improve the level of
              teaching and learning in select SLPS classrooms, but requires substantial
              preparation in order to undertake a rigorous study to advance the knowledge
              base and have implications beyond the specific classrooms involved.
