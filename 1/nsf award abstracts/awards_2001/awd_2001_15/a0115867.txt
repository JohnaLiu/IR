              Abstract


The objective of this proposed research is to identify molecular
              mechanisms for wall slip and flow instabilities leading to sharkskin-like
              extrudate distortion commonly encountered in flow of highly entangled polymeric
              materials.  This is to be accomplished by performing five experiments, the
              results of which will contribute to the understanding of different facets of
              this complex phenomenon
