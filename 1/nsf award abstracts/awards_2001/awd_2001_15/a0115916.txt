Beginning in 1947, Catherine and Keith Hayes raised Viki, a common
              chimpanzee, as if she were a human infant. The experiment continued until
              Viki's untimely death in 1954 of viral encephalitis. During that time,
              Catherine Hayes kept a detailed daily diary of Viki's behavior, collected
              numerous photographs of the project, along with unpublished book chapters and
              manuscript materials. This is the most important cross-rearing project of its
              kind, given the length of the effort, the quality of the investigators, and the
              thorough documentation of the project.

Catherine Hayes (now Catherine
              Nissen), preserved these extensive records of the project. She is now suffering
              from Alzheimer's disease, and is reluctant to make any permanent arrangements
              for the disposition of these invaluable scientific records. Her daughter, Diana
              Hovey, believes it is possible to negotiate such an arrangement.  This project
              supports a visit by the PI to meet with Catherine Nissen in Middleton, WI, in
              the near future.  The goal is to arrange for a donation of these invaluable
              scientific records. Photocopies of all material are to be made, along with copy
              photographs of images. The project supports an undergraduate student to conduct
               the preliminary sorting of the copied materials.  The PI also intends to
              negotiate with an institution, according to Ms. Nissen's wishes, for a
              permanent home for the extensive records of this singularly important research
              project.
