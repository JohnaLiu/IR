A low-cost spectrophotometer for use with a new 0.5
              meter telescope at the Etelman Observatory of the University of the Virgin
              Islands will be designed, fabricated, tested, aligned, calibrated. It will be
              integrated with CCD detector and will have a spectral resolution of 6.5 and 13
              angstroms over the spectral range between 3,300 and 9,000 micrometers
              wavelength. The science proposed will compare stellar fluxes measured with this
              instrument with model atmospheres to improve determination of effective
              temperatures and to study chemically peculiar stars.   This small non-PhD
              granting institution has a large education program that will engage many
              students in the use of this telescope both for teaching and for undergraduate
              research.
