Abstract    :
              This grant provides the American Mathematical Society with funds to be used over
              three years to support mathematically talented U.S. undergraduates for a
              semester of study at the MATH in MOSCOW program of
the Independent University
              of Moscow. Funds  will be used to underwrite approximately half of the typical
              cost for a semester of study in the program for ten undergraduate students per
              (academic) year. The Independent University of Moscow (IUM) is a small, elite
              institution of higher learning focusing primarily on mathematics. It was
              founded in 1991 at the initiative of a group of well-known Russian research
              mathematicians, who now comprise the Academic Council of the University. The
              faculty of the IUM has well-established connections with the research community
              in the U.S. and Europe. The costs to administer
this program are being fully
              absorbed by the AMS, and all the funds provide will be used to support the
              students.
