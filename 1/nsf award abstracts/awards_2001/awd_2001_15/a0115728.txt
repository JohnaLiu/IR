Abstract    :
              The Jackson Public School District (JPS) proposes to significantly advance the
              science, mathematics, and technology education (SMT) of all K-12 students
              through the Jackson Urban Systemic Program (JUSP).  The District plans to
              accomplish this task by building on the existing infrastructure developed
              primarily through the Comprehensive Partnership for Mathematics and Science
              Achievement, the Center for Research in Teaching and Learning funded by the
              National Science Foundation (NSF), and the K-12 Higher Education Partnership
              funded by NSF in partnership with the National Institutes of Health.  This
              infrastructure is characterized by an exemplary leadership team, content
              standards for science and mathematics, policies in support of SMT education for
              all, the convergence of fiscal and intellectual resources, and a shared vision
              for improving the capacity of principals, teachers, and students.  

To
              accomplish the goals and objectives of the USP, the District intends to provide
              all of its students with the fundamentals of mathematics and science so that
              their understanding, ability, and academic achievement will enable them to
              perform at or above their peers from around the world.  The major goals are:
              (1) to increase student achievement in science and mathematics; (2) to increase
              competency in the science and mathematics instructional workforce; and (3) to
              strengthen the District's capacity to sustain SMT reform.  Hence, JPS will use
              the USP to improve its capacity to enhance student achievement via an
              articulated K-12 science and mathematics curriculum, a more diverse and highly
              qualified instructional workforce, and stronger and more focused partnerships.
