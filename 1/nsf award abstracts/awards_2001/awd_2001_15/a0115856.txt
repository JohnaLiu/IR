Digital receiver technology to design, build, test and
              apply a 327 MHz array radio receiver optimized for the detection and
              characterization of hyperfine deuterium line in the spectra of radio sources
              across the sky will be completed.  Measurement of the Deuterium line feature
              may enable the determination of the D/H ratio at different parts of the sky.
              The D/H ratio and its distribution probe fundamental physical parameters that
              reveal important factors in our understanding of the evolution of the Universe.
               The instrument development, in particular the digital receivers, RFI
              mitigation, beam forming, beam steering will serve as a pathfinder for the next
              generation ground-based radio telescopes.  There is significant student
              participation.
