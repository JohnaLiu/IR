Abstract    :
              This research project aims to provide experimental data on material resistance
              to wrinkling under various loading conditions and to provide a reliable and
              robust tool for simulating wrinkling in sheet metal forming processes, which
              will dramatically increase the confidence level on simulation results and
              therefore, be extremely beneficial to product and process development. The
              increasing environmental concerns and global competition have pressured the
              auto industry to aggressively search for thinner, lighter and stronger
              materials.  As the thickness of sheet metal decreases, the tendency towards
              wrinkling increases significantly.  It is therefore essential to have a good
              understanding of the onset of wrinkling and its post-buckling behavior of sheet
              metal so that the development time of bringing these new materials to final
              goods can be minimized.  The experiments will include a newly developed wedge
              test, a shrink flanging test and forming of an irregular three-dimensional
              shape.    The test results will be used to verify the computability of a new
              simulation tool, finite element methods with meshfree-enrichment (FEMME), which
              is believed to be able to capture local deformation effectively without the
              need of remeshing.  The methodology and associated software routines will be
              posted on our website for easy public access.
