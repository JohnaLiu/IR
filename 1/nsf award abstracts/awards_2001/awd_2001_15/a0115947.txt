This award supports theoretical research and education
              directed mainly toward the
electronic properties of metals and semiconductors.
               The PI will continue a broad based research program on (III, Mn)V
              semiconductors, quantum Hall systems, high temperature superconductors,
              aromatic molecular crystals, carbon nanotube systems, and properties of exotic
              solid state q-bits.
Work on (III, Mn)V semiconductors aims to develop a
              reliable theoretical description of transport and magnetic properties.  Work on
              quantum Hall systems involves developing quantum field theory models for
              quantum Hall ferromagnets at integer fillings, investigating possible
              explanations of the huge longitudinal resistance discovered at Landau filling
              of 2/3, exploring a real-space picture of composite fermion correlations, and
              exploring a theory of double superfluidity and its possible extensions to the
              high temperature superconductors. 
 This award also contributes to broad and
              rounded educational experiences in condensed matter theory at the
              undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels.

This award supports a
              broad-based research program in theoretical condensed matter physics. The work
              attacks a wide range of open problems in quantum Hall systems and ferromagnetic
              semiconductors with possible repercussions on the fields of high temperatures
              superconductivity, and the emerging field of quantum computing. This award
              directly contributes to the emerging fields of "spintronics" and
              nanoelectronics that may form the basis of future electronic device
              technologies. The PI is also committed to providing broad educational
              experiences in condensed matter theory from the undergraduate level on up.
