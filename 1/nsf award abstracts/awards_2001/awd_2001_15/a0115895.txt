Abstract    :
              AST-0115895

Caton, Daniel B.
An astronomical telescope and dome system for
              research and training students will be developed at Appalachia State
              University. Appalachia State University is a small non-PhD granting institution
              dedicated primarily to teaching.  Research will be centered on measurements of
              eclipsing binaries and the detection of planets at the L4 and L5 points within
              eclipsing binary systems. The telescope will also be used to measure planet
              occultation of stars to characterize planets.
