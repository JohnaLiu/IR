Abstract    :
              0115078 Yang  Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are universal
              molecular switches that control the flow of extracellular signals to
              intracellular signal transduction pathways in eukaryotic organisms. 
              Arabidopsis possesses a unique subfamily of small G proteins, termed Rop.   Rop
              regulates many signal transduction pathways in Arabidopsis.  This proposed
              research is focused on a Rop-dependent pathway that controls the morphogenesis
              of leaf epidermal pavement cells.   Because plant cells are encased in cell
              walls and are non-motile, cell morphogenesis is particularly important for
              plant growth and development.  Having a unique cell shape with interlocking
              lobes and sinuses, epidermal pavement cells provide a useful model system for
              studying the mechanism of cell morphogenesis in plants. Previous studies using
              transgenic expression of Rop2 dominant mutant genes suggest that one or more
              Rops controls the formation of lobes.  However, these studies did not reveal
              which of the 11 Arabidopsis Rop GTPases participate in the signaling pathway
              that controls the morphogenesis of pavement cells.  Furthermore, other
              components in this pathway are unknown.   As a first step in the long-term goal
              of elucidating the molecular mechanism of cell morphogenesis in Arabidopsis,
              this proposed work contains two major aims.  First, knockout mutants for
              Arabidopsis Rop genes will be used to determine which Rop gene(s) controls the
              morphogenesis of leaf pavement cells.  Second, components of the Rop-dependent
              morphogenesis pathway will be identified using the yeast two-hybrid method
              complemented with a high throughput proteomics approach.  This research plan is
              expected to identify new genes that control cell morphogenesis and plant
              development.  These genes may prove to be useful for genetically manipulating
              plant forms that are beneficial to agricultural and horticultural practices.
