              ABSTRACT


For complex nanocomposite systems, the modeling and prediction
              methodology must cover length scale from molecular (nanometer) to meso and
              macroscale. The goal of this proposal is to improve and expand computational
              mechanics of a nanocomposite system using the experimentally determined
              nanomechanical properties and incorporating them into meso and macroscale
              models. Specifically, we propose to develop a multiscale model to simulate
              mechanical responses of nacre, a biomimetic layered nanocomposite of organic
              and an inorganic components. Numerical models using three-dimensional finite
              element analysis will be developed for predicting nonlinear and time dependant
              response of the nanocomposite. Advanced computational facilities (NCSA
              supercomputers) and experimental facilities (high resolution scanning probe and
              transmission electron microscopy, vibrational spectroscopy) will be utilized
              for this research.  Results of this research will result in potential criteria
              for practical, simulation-based materials design of scalable and complex
              (hybrid) composites containing both a soft and a hard component using the
              concepts of both biomimetics and nanotechnology.
