Abstract    :
              This project, in conjunction with similar support from ARO, ONR, AFOSR and DoE
              will support travel expenses to facilitate participation of roughly 50 graduate
              students to the 14th U.S. National Congress of Theoretical and Applied
              Mechanics.  This workshop is held every four years under the auspices of the
              U.S. National Committee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics and this year it
              will be hosted by the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics at
              Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.  It will provide a setting
              for exchanging ideas, cultivating friendships, renewing acquaintances, building
              networks, and educating graduate students.  Key and distinguished individuals
              from industry, academe, and government, from all over the world will be invited
              to give keynote lectures and presentations in the workshop. A special emphasis
              will be placed on the emerging fields of nanoscience, wave propragation in
              heterogeneous media, fluid-structure interaction and Mechanics Education. 
              Every effort will be made to select both an ethnically and scientifically
              diverse group of students to represent all areas of theoretical and applied
              mechanics.
