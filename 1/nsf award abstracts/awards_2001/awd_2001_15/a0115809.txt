MRI: 
              Development of Instrumentation for AGAVE:  the Access Grid Autostereo Virtual
              Environment 

This is a proposal for instrumentation development under the
              Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program to support research and student
              training in tele-immersion technologies for a networked, collaborative
              virtual-reality environment.  The focus is on AGAVE, a tiled, high-resolution
              autostereo display that integrates well with very-high-speed networks.
