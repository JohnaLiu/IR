Abstract    :
              The object of this project is to develop control algorithms for the cancellation
              of periodic disturbances whose frequency content varies significantly over
              time.  Typical applications include active noise and vibration control,
              although the problems under consideration are generic and the algorithms are
              applicable in many other contexts.  Two classes of algorithms are considered. 
              They have been studied before for restricted cases and have shown promising
              results.  The algorithms are particularly valuable because of their simplicity
              and because of the tools available to design them for specific performance
              goals.  In the project, the algorithms will be developed so that they will
              become applicable to the most general problems with multivariable system and
              with disturbances having multiple harmonic components.  An important
              intermediate goal will be the analysis of the robustness properties of adaptive
              algorithms using little known but powerful results of linear time-invariant
              system equivalence.  These results will enable a precise quantification of the
              robustness margins of the algorithms, and may lead to new strategies for robust
              design.  Another goal is the development of new algorithms for the estimation
              and tracking of the parameters of periodic signals using multiple sensors.  The
              algorithms will be tested in active noise control or active vibration control
              experiments.
