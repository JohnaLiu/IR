This is a proposal submitted by Dr. Cheng Zhu, Georgia
              Institute of Technology and Professor Long Mian, Chinese Academy of Science,
              for hosting a U.S.-China young investigator workshop on biomechanics.  Dr. Zhu
              requests travel expenses for 10 U.S. scientists to attend this meeting, which
              is to be held in Beijing, China on August 1-5, 2001.  The purpose of this
              workshop is to bring together young scientists and engineers for an exchange of
              views on future trends in biomechanics, to exchange research ideas and results,
              and to stimulate U.S.-China collaborative research in this field.  The NSF and
              the National Science Foundation of China jointly support this workshop.
