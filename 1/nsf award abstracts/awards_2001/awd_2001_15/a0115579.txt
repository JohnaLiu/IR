Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Bates College will acquire a 400 MHz NMR
              Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a)
              the development of chiral NMR shift reagents; b) the biomimetic synthesis of
              paeciolospirone, a marine polyketide; and c) the development of
              metalloporphyrin-based heterogeneous catalysts for use in the decomposition of
              toxic chemicals or for environmentally-benign synthesis.   
Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists
              for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify
              unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
              solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
              studies will have an impact in a number of areas, in particular environmental
              chemistry.
