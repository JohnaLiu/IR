Abstract    :
              In order to obtain the greatly needed in-situ, continuous information on
              hurricane properties, a balloon measuring system will be developed that can be
              deployed from aircraft into the eyes of hurricanes.  The hybrid system includes
              a natural shaped balloon to carry the measurement equipment and an attached
              drogue near the surface to maintain the balloon altitude.  The hypothesis is
              that the inflow into the center of a hurricane will keep the balloon system in
              or very near the eye for the life of the storm over water.  The goal is to
              obtain continuous measurements in the storm center where major fluctuations of
              storm intensity occur.  Furthermore, the measurements will serve as "ground
              truth" for satellite-based techniques for estimating storm intensity.  The
              project is the Phase I of a broader-scale effort.  In this phase, the balloon
              system will be developed and tested in controlled environments, in numerical
              simulations and, to a limited extent, in the field.  If successful, a Phase II
              proposal will be submitted for more extensive field-testing in real hurricanes,
              and possible operational implementation.  A subcontractor, Modelsym, Inc, will
              carry out the fabrication of the balloon system.  The planned work, if proven
              to be successful, would be of tremendous value in providing an inexpensive
              approach to obtaining valuable data for hurricanes.
