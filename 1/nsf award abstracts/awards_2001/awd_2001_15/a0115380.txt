Abstract    :
              Biotechnology and genetic engineering have become major social issues in
              the
United States and around the world.  In 1998, Durant, Bauer, and
              Gaskell
published Biotechnology in the Public Sphere, which contained profiles
              of
twelve European nations in terms of public perceptions, policy
              decisions,
and media discourse.  At that time, a collaboration with
              researchers in the
U.S. was developed, leading to another book to be released
              in the Fall 2001,
which contains surveys conducted in 17 European nations,
              Canada, and the
U.S.  Another round of  surveys to measure public perceptions
              is scheduled
to take place in late 2001 or early 2002. These surveys will help
              to understand from 
a longitudinal perspective how the public is changing
              (ornot changing) their 
views towards such things as genetically modified
              crops,medical biotechnology, 
and food containing genetically engineered
              products. This project will support a
national telephone survey within the
              U.S. and will be coordinated with the 
comparable survey in Europe.  This
              survey will also support analysis and publications
aimed at not only gaining
              an insight into the issue of biotechnology, but also social 
change and the
              social construction of social problems.
