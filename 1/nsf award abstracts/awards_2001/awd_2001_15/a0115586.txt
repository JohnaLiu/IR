Abstract    :
              The Arabidopsis genome project uncovered a large set of genes involved in
              nitrogen uptake, metabolism, and allocation (600+).  Expression studies on a
              small subset showed that nitrogen status regulates the transcription of many of
              these genes. Proposed signals include nitrate, ammonium, glutamine, and C:N
              balance. At present, there is little or no understanding of the regulatory
              molecules or networks involved in signaling N-status and integrating N
              metabolism in plant growth. We propose to use expression arrays to identify
              circuits of genes regulated by N-status (inorganic-N and organic-N), to use
              bioinformatic sequence analysis to identify N-responsive cis-elements, and to
              determine the function of key genes we identify by defining the phenotype of
              mutants lacking each gene and by determining the biochemical properties of the
              expressed proteins including describing meaningful interactions with other
              macromolecules and determining where and when each is expressed. Our analysis
              will allow us to place the activity of these genes and N-regulatory networks in
              the context of plant growth and development.   A computer cluster will store
              the large amounts of data generated in this project and we will provide a
              publicly accessible Web page that will include expression databases, gene
              identification information, and all software developed in the proposed project.
               This community resource will be linked to the major plant databases for the
              widest possible distribution of information.   It is expected that our results
              will substantially advance our understanding of nitrogen metabolism in the
              context of plant growth, as well as provide new insights into our understanding
              of complex regulatory networks.  Given the central role of nitrogen
              availability and metabolism in crop productivity, these results will also have
              broad agricultural impacts.
