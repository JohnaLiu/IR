This is a three-year cooperative proposal between Dr. Haitao
              Fan of Georgetown University and Dr. Tong Yang of  the City University of Hong
              Kong.  Dr. Fan requests two visits, one in the summer of 2001 and the other in
              the summer of 2003 for conducting a joint research on hyperbolic partial
              differential equations (PDE) for reactive flow equations. Both the U.S. and
              Hong Kong P.I.s are experienced researchers in this field.  The application of
              the PDE to reactive flow equations is a promising research area and can
              continue keep the U.S. at the forefront of an important mathematical field.
