Abstract    :
              After nine years of this alliance, we have learned what the needs of our
              students are, and acted to produced desired results.  We will continue many of
              the strategies put in place over the past nine years, since they are producing
              excellent results!
GOALS:  The aims of the Mississippi Alliance in Phase III
              will be to:
1. Increase the number of SMET graduates from an estimated 661 to
              825 by 2007;
2. Increase the number and percentage of minority students
              enrolled in SMET;
3. Increase retention rates of minority students in
              SMET;
4. Increase the annual graduation rate of enrolled seniors;
5. Track
              progression of baccalaureates into graduate and professional programs and
              careers;
6. Double the number of baccalaureates enrolling into graduate
              programs in SMET by 2007;
7. Double the number of minority students who earn
              Ph.D. degrees in SMET by 2007;
8. Develop institutional cultures that value
              diversity;
9. Forge partnerships with business and government across the state
              and region;
10. Leverage the federal dollars into institutionalized
              programs;
We will continue to emphasize undergraduate education but will
              develop productive bridges to graduated education.
