Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop a continuous production
              manufacturing process for folding flat sheets into complex three dimensions
              patterns that uses a novel material flow based upon mathematical symmetry.  The
              investigation will involve machine design and construction, and a careful
              analysis of the mathematical theory of the material folding mechanisms.
              Previous exploratory research has demonstrated that metal, polymer and paper
              sheets can folded into doubly periodic surfaces by folding techniques alone,
              and established the matematical theory to explain the folding process for one
              class of DPFs  and to extend these methods into practical algorithms describing
              the explicit facet geometry and vertex locations. The focus of this project is
              to describe mathematically how the material transforms into the intricate three
              dimensions patterns inside the main roller system of the machine, complete with
              the knowledge of the migration and instating of fold creases, to enable us to
              streamline the manufacturing process for rapid and high quality production of
              these versatile folded structures.

 The interdisciplinary effort linking
              mathematics and engineering will benefit education in both areas with numerous
              opportunities for advancement of manufacturing integration and applied
              mathematics exploration.
