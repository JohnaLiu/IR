Abstract    :
              This grant provides support for a workshop that will introduce decision theory
              to engineering design faculty.  The goals of the workshop are to acquaint
              engineering faculty with the mathematics of decision theory, to ground them in
              the mathematics necessary to correctly apply decision theory to engineering
              design and other decision making processes in engineering, and to provide an
              exportable version of the workshop that will enable the workshop to have a
              broader impact than just for the faculty who can attend.  The workshop will be
              conducted in a tutorial fashion, with invited experts representing mathematics,
              economics and the decision sciences, and will provide ample time for
              interaction between the attending faculty and the experts.  Topics that will be
              covered include decision making under uncertainty, decision procedures, game
              theory, probability theory and elements of engineering microeconomics
              appropriate to engineering design.

It is expected that the outcome of this
              workshop will be a heightened awareness of the principles of decision theory
              and its applications to engineering.  This will likely affect the entirety of
              engineering education and practice, and will ultimately result in improved
              decision making across all engineering fields.
