Abstract    :
              This planning grant will develop a comprehensive plan to refine, broaden and
              implement an interdisciplinary curriculum model that has proven effective in
              accelerating learning for diverse student populations in science and reading at
              the upper elementary grades.   Collaborators are the school districts of
              Broward and Palm Beach Counties.   The project will also contribute to the
              knowledge base about specific design features associated with quality teacher
              professional development.
