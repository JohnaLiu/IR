Abstract    :
              This project supports research for an alternative to student loans as a way to
              finance higher education.  The project utilizes the theory behind financial
              instruments such as call or put options to develop the alternative, an
              education call option.  The education call option is intended to protect
              students from investing in higher education and then not earning an income
              substantial enough to afford basic living expenses, loan repayments, or future
              investment in education.  Hence, the option functions as insurance against the
              risk of investing in higher education.  Like any insurance policy, it is
              important to have a premium and deductible that are economically beneficially
              to both the policyholder and underwriter.  A major objective of this project is
              to develop analytically tractable methods for pricing the education call option
              that can be used in practice.
