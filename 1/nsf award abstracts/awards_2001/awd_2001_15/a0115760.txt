Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa will acquire
              digitally-enhanced data collection and processing systems for nuclear magnetic
              resonance (NMR) equipment. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out
              studies on a) macromolecular protein and DNA/PNA solution structure
              determinations; b) dendrimer characterizations; c) paramagnetic chemical
              systems; and d) synthetic chemistry.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. 
              Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including biochemistry and materials chemistry.
