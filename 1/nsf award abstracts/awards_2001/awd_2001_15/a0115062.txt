The entire 130 million base pair genome of the plant
              Arabidopsis thaliana was finished last year.  The objective of this project is
              to leverage the genome sequence to catalog the naturally occurring genetic
              variation in the species.  The project is based on the theoretical insight
              that, in highly self-fertilizing organisms, like A. thaliana, it should be
              possible to create such a catalog very efficiently by looking at the pattern of
              variation in a number of small segments distributed over the genome.  Rather
              than sequencing the entire genome of one additional individual, one should
              sequence 1% of the genome in 100 individuals.

Specifically, the project will
              sequence 1500-2000 chromosomal segments of length 500-700 base pairs,
              distributed over the genome, in a sample of 96 carefully selected individuals. 
              The data will be publicly available through GenBank, as well as through a
              highly flexible relational database developed specifically for this purpose. 
              The database will be equipped with web-based bioinformatics tools to query it,
              and will be continuously updated.

The project represents the first serious
              attempt to describe the genomic variation in a species.  It is highly relevant
              to the objectives of the 2010 project in a general sense, because it will not
              be possible to "determine the function of all genes [...] within their
              cellular, organismal, and evolutionary contexts" without understanding how
              genetic variation is structured in the species.  More immediately, the database
              will be an invaluable resource for plant geneticists interested in finding the
              genes responsible for variation in agriculturally important traits such as
              drought tolerance.  In this respect, the project should be compared to the
              large databases of human variation that are currently being created to aid
              genetic epidemiology. The tools and methods created for this project will also
              be directly applicable to several organisms of direct economic importance, such
              as rice and barley.   Finally, the database will serve as a very important
              training tool for students in computational and evolutionary biology, and in
              statistical genetics.
