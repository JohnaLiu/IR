Abstract

The
              objective of this proposed research is to enhance the scientific understanding
              of and to establish a profound theoretical foundation for mechanics of
              materials with micro-structure and micromotion. It includes: (1) the
              construction of a unified theory for micro-continuum based on statistical
              mechanics, molecular dynamics, nonlocal theory, polar theory and
              thermodynamics. It will be capable of explaining and predicting a large class
              of microscopic phenomena in which the ratios of the external to internal
              characteristic length and time approach unity; (2) the development of a
              computational basis, including finite element method and molecular dynamics
              method, for the above-mentioned theory; (3) the applications of the theory
              through the computer simulations to the fields where the effect of length scale
              is predominant to the material response.
