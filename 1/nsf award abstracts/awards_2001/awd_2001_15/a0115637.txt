Abstract    :
              This planning grant is a collaboration between George Washington University,
              Montgomery County Pubic Schools, AAAS Project 2061, and the Center for Applied
              Linguistics.  The project's goal is to study how science curriculum materials
              and their implementation can be improved.  The project will conduct a pilot
              study of student achievement, motivation, and engagement for a highly rated 8th
              grade curriculum unit (Chemistry that Applies-CTA).   This unit was one of the
              few that rated highly in the evaluation procedure developed by AAAS' Project
              2061.  The study's purpose is to determine if there are different effects of
              highly rated curriculum materials and to identify the modifications that can be
              made for the highly rated materials to be more effective for subgroups of
              diverse learners.
