Following the NSF
              sponsored IAMC'99 Workshop and reinforcing an emerging research trend in making
              mathematical computation and data accessible on the Internet, the workshop
              provides a timely forum for researchers to further exchange ideas and discuss
              standards.  The workshop will have invited talks, contributed papers, panel
              discussions, and system demonstrations.  The results will be made available on
              the Web.  An article overviewing the state of the art and future developments
              will be prepared for wide dissemination (e.g. publication in the magazine
              Science or Scientific American).  An IAMC working group will be organized to
              foster research collaboration after the workshop.

The IAMC workshop is being
              organized by Angel Diaz of IBM, Norbert Kajler of Ecole des Mines de Paris, and
              Paul S. Wang (the PI) of Kent State University as a pre-conference activity of
              ISSAC'01.  The requested budget of $4,200 covers travel reimbursements and
              honoraria for invited speakers.  With this support, the workshop will charge no
              registration fee for attendees.  The workshop and this proposal have strong
              support from ISSAC'2001 organizers.
