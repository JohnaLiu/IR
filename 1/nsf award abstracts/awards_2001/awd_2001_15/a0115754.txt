Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to continue collaborative efforts between
              Michigan State University and North Carolina State University to explore the
              thermophilicity of class II xylose isomerases (XIs) with the ultimate goal of
              providing the scientific and engineering bases for a superior isomerization
              process.  The specific research objectives include: (1) to use protein
              engineering to develop a superior XI able to produce a 55% fructose syrup at
              high temperature and low pH in the absence of unwanted by-product formation and
              without the requirement for a chromatographic enrichment step; (2) to address
              the bioprocessing issues relevant to such biocatalysts; (3) to examine the
              differences and similarities among class II XIs as a basis for developing
              thermostabilization and thermoactivation strategies useful for other enzymes;
              and (4) to consider other monosaccharide biotransformations that operate at
              elevated temperatures and that have technological potential.
