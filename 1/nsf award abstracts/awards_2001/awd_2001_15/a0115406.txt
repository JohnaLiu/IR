Abstract    :
              In IC fabrication chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is used to planarize
              surfaces of
conductors like aluminum, tungsten, tantalum and copper and
              dielectrics like silicon dioxide,
silicon nitride, and low-k polymers. The CMP
              process is the only technique available now to
provide surfaces across the die
              and wafer with planarity sufficient to meet the stringent depth of
focus
              requirements of shorter wavelength lithographic techniques. The CMP of low-k
              polymeric
materials and architectures overlaid on these polymers is
              challenging. This is because the low-k
polymeric materials are mechanically
              softer and even porous, can flow under heat, and have
hydrophobic surfaces.
              There exists a critical need for developing low pressure, selective,
              and
effective CMP process of the new, low-k polymers and architectures
              overlaid on these polymers.
The primary objective of this program is to
              develop a novel approach using magnetically
responsive slurries (MRS) to
              conduct CMP of low-k polymers and associated structures. The
project is a
              joint collaborative, interdisciplinary, synergistic effort between
              investigators from
Clarkson University and University of Pittsburgh, with
              collaboration with industry. A
fundamental and systematic investigation of the
              feasibility such a magnetically assisted CMP
process will be conducted. The
              outcome of this program has the potential for a significantly high
economic
              payoff. This project will have significant combined impact on the: basic
              science that
forms the underpinning of the CMP technology, research
              infrastructure, and development of
human resources.
