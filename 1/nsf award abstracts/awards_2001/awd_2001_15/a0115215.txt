Description:  This award supports US-India cooperative
              research entitled High Temperature Dielectric Studies on Advanced Materials in
              the High Frequency Region.  The US investigators are Dinesh Agrawal and Michael
              Lanagan, Pennsylania State University; Indian investigators are Dinesh Dube and
              H.C. Gupta, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi.  Microwave processing is
              emerging as a widely accepted new processing technology for a variety of
              materials, especially advanced ceramics.  In spite of advancements, the
              physical understanding of how materials absorb microwaves is not understood. 
              The investigators will conduct structural characterization studies on advanced
              ceramic materials to determine the electrical/dielectric properties in
              different frequency regions with emphasis on high frequency measurements.  They
              intend to extend characterization to magnetic materials and to metal powders. 
              The results are expected to shed light on the physical mechanisms responsible
              for microwave adsorption during microwave processing.  This is a fast emerging
              area in processing technology.  

Scope:  Professor Agrawal is a world leader
              in this area with several innovations in microwave characterization technique
              to his credit.  The Materials Research Laboratory at Penn State University is a
              premier laboratory for advanced materials.  The Indian researchers have long
              been engaged in investigating electrical properties of materials in the high
              frequency region.  This project offers the opportunity for international
              collaboration and the strengthening of institutional connections between Penn
              State and the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.   The project is jointly
              supported by the Division of International Programs and the Government of
              India's Department of Science & Technology.
