Description:  This award supports a US-India
              cooperative research project entitled Investigation of Bubble Size Distribution
              Profiles in Gas-Liquid Systems.  The collaborators are Professor D. Ramkrishna,
              Department of Chemical Engineering, Purdue University and Professor J.B. Joshi,
              Department of Chemical Technology, Bombay University.  They will make a
              systematic investigation of the effect that bubble population balance may have
              on prediction of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations in gas-liquid
              flow.  Such calculations are usually done with an assumed single bubble size
              and coalescence, and break-up phenomena and resulting bubble size distributions
              are ignored. 

Scope:  This collaboration will combine the US investigator's 
              expertise on bubble dynamics, break-up and coalescence, and population balance
              with Professor Joshi's  experimental facilities needed to measure model
              predictions.  Together they can advance the current state of the art of
              gas-liquid flows significantly.  The US and Indian graduate students involved
              in this project will have the advantage of exposure to the best available
              thinking in the field of gas-liquid bubbly flows.  This research could have a
              profound impact on design and scale-up of gas-liquid contactors, which are
              common to numerous chemical processes and are of great technological and
              economic importance.
