Proposal Number: 0115650

The goal of this project is to advance
              the existing technology of the supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) process by
              developing fundamental knowledge which can be used to define an efficient and
              environmentally safe way to destroy toxic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)
              extracted from contaminated soil/sediments or from disposal sites.  PCBs are
              highly toxic organic pollutants (POPs) included by 122 nations on a recently
              banned list of chemicals known as the "dirty dozen."  The 209 PCB congeners are
              approximately twice the number of the elements in the Periodic Table and 17
              times the number of chlorobenzenes, offering chess0like possibilities of
              investigations.  Systematically selected congeners and the most used industrial
              PCB mixtures will be oxidized in SCW both neat and methanolic solutions. 
              Emphasis will be on the methanolic solutions due to observed rate-enhancing
              quality of MeOH on PCB dechlorination.  Several solutions obtained by
              SC-CO2/MeOH extraction from PCB polluted real world sediments will also be
              studied to couple the extraction and oxidation steps of a soil remediation
              technology being developed by the PI.  This approach will permit one to design
              and optimally operate competitive SCWO large-scale units for PCBs and other
              related pollutants under less severe conditions than those proposed without
              kinetic studies and without reaction rate enhancers.  Based on experimental
              results, reaction kinetics and pathways and structure-reactivity relationships
              will be developed.

PCB oxidation experiments in supercritical water will be
              conducted in a high-pressure, isothermal plug-flow tubular reactor capable of
              continuous operation at temperatures up to 873 K and pressures up to 60 MPa. 
              The approach is to select thermodynamic, kinetic and process parameters in
              order to find the optimum conditions for achieving the strategic goal of safe
              and efficient PCB destruction under the least aggressive conditions.  The main
              parameters considered are temperature (673 - 874 K), pressure (25 - 35 MPa),
              residence time (1-240 s), and solute concentration (0.1 - 10 g/L in MeOH, and
              10-3 - 10 mmol/L in SCW).  

This knowledge will be disseminated to the
              research community through publications and presentations and will provide a
              model training/education to students, including Native Americans living on PCB
              contaminated lands.
