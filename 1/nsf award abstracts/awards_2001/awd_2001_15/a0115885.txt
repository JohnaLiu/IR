MRI: 
              Instrumentation for Intelligent Agent and Wireless Computing Research 

This
              is a proposal for equipment acquisition under the Major Research
              Instrumentation (MRI) program to support research and student training on
              intelligent agents in a mobile environment.  The Wireless Intelligent Simulator
              Environment being established will integrate software agents, human agents, and
              robot agents, so that physically distributed interacting agents can perform a
              variety of tasks cooperatively or competitively.
