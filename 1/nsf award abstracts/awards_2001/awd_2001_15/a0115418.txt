Abstract    :
                   This project proposes a technological-economic-organizational analysis of
              the barriers preventing the substitution of cellulosic ethanol from replacing
              gasoline as a fuel for automobiles and light trucks in the United States. They
              propose to investigate the amount of ethanol that could be produced in the US
              and its cost of production, the circumstances under which it might displace
              gasoline as a motor fuel, and the technological, economic, and organizational
              barriers to ethanol use. Even if cellulosic ethanol were more attractive than
              gasoline as a motor fuel, hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure are
              presently dedicated to gasoline use. Enormous inertia together with specific
              technological, economic and organizational barriers would be expected to hamper
              the transition to ethanol. Building on prior work on alternative automobile
              fuels and working relationships with General Motors, Ford, Texaco, ExxonMobil
              and BP Amoco, the researchers will examine the conditions under which ethanol
              might become a more attractive fuel, and the organizational and other barriers
              to its adoption.
