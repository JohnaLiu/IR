Abstract    :
              The project is a partnership between the Concord Consortium, Harvard,
              Northwestern, University of Michigan, the Center or Learning Technologies in
              Urban Schools (LeTUS) and the Firtchburn, Hudson, and Lowell Public Schools to
              study the impact of modeling on secondary science learning. Tools called CIE
              models incorporate core science content that students learn through interaction
              and exploration. The project will explore the hypothesis that students learn
              more through such models by testing it in real schools. Data will be collected
              from Pedagogica (the technological environment), annual administration of a
              project-generated assessment, extensive interviews, and standardized tests.
