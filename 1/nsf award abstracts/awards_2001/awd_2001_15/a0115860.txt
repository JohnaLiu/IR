Abstract    :
              The question of whether infants and older toddlers differentiate the world of
              objects into fundamentally similar kinds of categories has persisted for
              decades, largely due to the absence of methods for assessing categorization
              that are effective across a wide variety of ages.  The concepts of preverbal
              infants must be examined through techniques that are independent of language,
              while language production and comprehension typically are vital to the
              assessment of toddlers' early concepts.  Determining whether younger and older
              infants possess similar types of concepts is relevant to broader questions
              concerning the degree to which cognitive development is continuous or
              discontinuous.  On the one hand, differences between the category extensions of
              infants and older toddlers may be due to different methods of assessment or to
              different levels of experience with objects.  Even within a single age group,
              infants may produce different patterns of category extension across different
              categorization tasks because the tasks vary in terms of attentional and other
              information-processing demands.  On the other hand, fundamental differences may
              exist between prelinguistic infants and older infants who know names for things
              because they possess qualitatively different representational systems.  By this
              account, within-group variations in categorization emerge because different
              procedures tap different categorization processes.  This research will
              introduce a new method, a comprehension measure of associative generalization,
              that is intended to help determine the basis for between-group and within-group
              variations in categorization during infancy.  In this method, preferred looking
              will serve as an index of infants' understanding of conceptual boundaries and
              will correct for methodological problems associated with production-based
              responses such as imitation and labeling.  

Throughout three consecutive
              phases of the project, the comprehension measure of associative generalization
              will be used to explore infants' understanding of the toy replicas often used
              in studies of early categorization as symbols for the corresponding real
              objects, and to differentiate among three alternative developmental sequences
              in the emergence of concepts:  (1) Domain-first:  Infants' early concepts are
              global in nature (e.g., at the level of animal or vehicle) and broad concepts
              control infants' associations of category properties;  (2) Basic-first: 
              Infants' initial concepts are at the basic level (e.g., dog, cat, car, or
              truck), and domain-level generalizations obtained through production-based
              imitation tasks are attributable to overextensions of basic level categories;
              and (3) Variable specificity:  Infants possess rudimentary knowledge that
              different types of properties are aligned with categories at different levels
              of specificity.  The last would imply that certain properties are generalized
              at the basic level, and others are generalized at the domain level; such
              awareness would constitute evidence for rudimentary understanding of the
              asymmetry of class inclusion relations.

The development of a
              comprehension-based analog to productive imitation measures has tremendous
              potential to serve as a methodological "bridge" between tasks appropriate for
              younger infants (e.g., habituation) and tasks suitable for older toddlers
              (e.g., naming, successive touching).  Such a tool will enable researchers to
              sensitively test the degree to which categorization processes remain stable
              throughout the first two years of life and will provide useful data for the
              development of intervention programs aimed at facilitating early lexical
              development.
