Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Wheeling Jesuit University will acquire an Anasazi
              EFT-NMR conversion package, which will allow the department to upgrade an
              obsolete nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR) to a Fourier transform
              (FT)-multinuclear system.  Faculty at Wheeling Jesuit are synthesizing indium
              and gallium dithiocarbamates for photovoltaic applications, and this equipment
              will allow them to identify products and impurities.   The instrument will also
              be used by undergraduates for their required thesis research and in their
              course work.  

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR
              spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
              The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas
              including materials chemistry.
