Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Connecticut College will acquire a 400 MHz NMR
              Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a)
              tandem intramolecular cyclization-Claisen rearrangement sequence as a facile
              route to the tetracyclic 5-7-6-3 ring system of phorbol; b) synthetic
              strategies toward the ingenol ring system; c) novel syntheses of biologically
              active 5,7-fused sesquiterpenoids; d) synthesis and characterization of firefly
              luciferin analogs; e) solution structure of the C-terminal domain of firefly
              luciferase; f) synthesis and characterization of doubly 15N-labeled
              coelenterazine; and g) the 13C-NMR characterization of nonaqueous sol-gel
              systems.  The NMR will also be used in the undergraduate laboratory courses.  
              

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
              available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
              used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from
              these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry.
