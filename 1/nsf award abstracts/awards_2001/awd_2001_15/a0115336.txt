Description:  This award supports a US-India cooperative
              research project entitled  "Complete" Spectroscopy at High Angular Momentum in
              Nuclei in the Vicinity of the Neutron Magic Number N=50.  The collaborators are
              Professor Umesh Garg, University of Notre Dame and Professor Sandeep Ghugre,
              Inter-University Consortium for DAE Facilities, Calcutta Centre.  The PIs will
              investigate nuclei in the vicinity of the N=50 closed shell.  In addition to
              obtaining data on high-angular momentum states in the N~50 nuclei, they propose
              to do a "complete" spectroscopy of a number of nuclei with a view to
              understanding the evolution of nuclear structure effects.  Novel effects
              include "anti-magnetic rotation" and "wobbling motion" in nuclei.

Scope: 
              Experiments will be performed at the Gammasphere facility in the US and at the
              MEHIA facility at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India. 
              This project will actively involve graduate students and Postdocs at both
              institutions.  In addition to providing the opportunity to work at
              state-of-the-art facilities, the proposed experiments will form Ph.D.
              dissertation projects for students in both countries.  This project is jointly
              supported by the Division of International Programs and the Government of
              India's Department of Science and Technology.
