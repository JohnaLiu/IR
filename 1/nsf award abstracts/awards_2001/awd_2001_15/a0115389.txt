Abstract    :
              This project focuses on high quality teaching of foundational skills in the
              areas of reading and mathematics in grades 4 and 5.  This is an observational
              study and through a longitudinal study will develop and test multilevel models
              of how schools and teachers affect student achievement in reading and
              mathematics.  A primary goal of the study is to understand how schools and
              teachers scale up and sustain effective pedagogy over time for multiple student
              populations.  20 schools in Montgomery County, Maryland will be studied - 10
              from high poverty areas and 10 from moderate poverty areas. Data will be
              collected using standardized data collection instruments through 8 classroom
              observations/year over a period of three years in a total of 120 classrooms. 
              The data will track changes in school policy/practices, teacher pedagogy, and
              student learning.  The final year of the project will be devoted to data
              analysis and dissemination.
