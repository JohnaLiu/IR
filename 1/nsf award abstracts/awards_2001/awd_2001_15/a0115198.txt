Abstract    :
              The late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries found European science in
              flux, as new theories and discoveries reshaped Europe's intellectual life. At
              the same time, Europe's religious makeup was shifting, as Protestant and
              Catholic reforms altered doctrine and practice. This dissertation research
              project examines the ways in which science and religion interacted on the
              ground in this pivotal period, by investigating how the Catholic Church defined
              and policed the boundary between the natural and the supernatural. This
              dissertation will contribute to these key areas by drawing upon Church
              investigations into two spheres of supernatural power: magic and sainthood.
              Research funds will support a nine-month research trip to Italy to work
              primarily at the Archivio di Stato, the Archivio della Curia Patriarcale, and
              the Marciana library.
