Abstract    :
              Carbon nanotubes have exhibited the potential to enhance the physical and
              mechanical properties of polymer composites.  In the past few years, various
              methods have been invented to produce pure nanotubes with enhanced properties
              and reduced cost.  The two main barriers to the widespread use of nanotubes are
              (1) cost and (2) lack of processing techniques to disperse the nanotubes
              through the matrix without forming clusters and to influence their orientation
              behavior.  This project will address these issues by exploring methods to
              process nanotubes in glass-fiber-reinforced composites to form hybrid
              nano-micro composites.  Injection of the polymer resin and the carbon nanotubes
              suspension into glass-fiber performs will enable the manufacture of hybrid
              nano-micro polymeric composites.  These materials will be less expensive than
              pure nano-composites, as the volume fraction of the nanotubes used will be
              small.  Modifying existing processes for fiber-reinforced composites can also
              reduce the manufacturing cost of nano-micro composites.  In this project, three
              innovative modifications of widely used Liquid Composite Molding (LCM)
              processes to manufacture composites and explore the flow-induced dispersion and
              orientation behavior of carbon nanotubes within fiber preforms will be
              introduced.  It has been shown that dispersion and alignment of nanotubes can
              be induced by rheological actions or by drawing the nanotubes suspension
              through a porous medium.  The new processes will use this concept of stretching
              the flow of the resin that carries the nanotubes by either elongation or shear.
               This will allow the development of qualitative understanding of the
              relationship between the dispersion and orientation behavior of the nanotubes
              and the suspension flow properties.  The statement of work is divided into
              three main tasks; (1) preparation and characterization of the rheological
              properties of suspensions containing nanotubes (2) processing of hybrid micro
              nanocomposites specimens with three different modified LCM processes, where
              nanotubes and resins are introduced in a mold containing pre-placed fiber
              preforms (3) examination and correlation of the microstructure to processing
              and measurement of enhancement in mechanical properties. The Center for
              Composite Material has the necessary equipment to conduct the study.  The
              long-range goal is to control the dispersion and the orientation behavior of
              the nanotubes by manipulating the shearing and stretching of the resin.  The
              overall intent is to make hybrid nano-micro composites into designable
              materials that will benefit both the carbon-nanotubes and the continuous
              micro-fiber system industries.
