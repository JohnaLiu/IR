This award provides partial support for
              participants to attend a workshop to be held at Stanford University in July and
              August 2001.  The scientific focus of the workshop will be centered around the
              Mumford Standard Class conjecture, one of the most important outstanding
              conjectures on the topology of moduli spaces.  There has been considerable
              progress on this conjecture in the last few years from several perspectives,
              including Algebraic Geometry, Algebraic Topology, and Theoretical Physics.  The
              workshop will bring together experts working on these questions.  The workshop
              will culminate with 
a five day meeting in August.  Further information,
              including invited speakers, schedule of talks, and housing information, is
              available
at both http://www.aimath.org/ and http://math.stanford.edu
