Abstract    :
              0115021 Gulseren  Description:  This project is to support a cooperative
              research project by Dr. Oguz Gulseren, Materials Science and Engineering
              Department, Dr. John Fischer, Physics Department, both at the University of
              Pennsylvania, and Dr. Selim Ciraci, Department of Physics, Bilkent University,
              Ankara, Turkey.  They plan to use advanced techniques to study the electronic
              and structural properties of carbon nanotubes and their functionalized
              derivatives.  In particular they will investigate the phase behavior of the
              carbon nanotubes under external pressure and strain, and their interactions
              with hydrogen and various transition metals.  The work will involve first
              principles calculations by groups from the Universities of Pennsylvania and
              Bilkent, as well as neutron scattering measurements performed by scientists at
              the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).   Scope:
              Nanoscience is an emerging field with promising important applications.  The
              results to be obtained from this project should help guide other activities
              focused on novel technological applications such as nanodevices and hydrogen
              storage etc.  The scientific methods to be used by the University of
              Pennsylvania and by Bilkent University are complementary in terms of material
              synthesis, measurement capabilities, and theoretical expertise.  The American
              PIs have excellent track records in NSF-supported research in carbon nanotubes.
               Dr. Ciraci has participated in a previous NSF international program that had
              good results in terms of scientific progress and publications.  The
              collaboration between American and Turkish groups will result in synergistic
              enhancements of the research.  This project meets INT criteria for supporting
              meritorious collaborative research of mutual benefit to the US and the foreign
              country.
