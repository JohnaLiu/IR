Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project examines how scientists involved in the
              debate over fallout hazards managed the necessary uncertainties in the
              scientific, ideological, and ethical issues of the controversy. Political and
              public demands for a resolution to the debate over fallout hazards placed
              scientists in an uncomfortable position. They were asked questions for which
              they had no conclusive answers then or in the foreseeable future. Scientific
              research on fallout hazards rested on incomplete and inconclusive data. The
              multitude of disciplinary and institutional affiliations of the scientists
              involved exacerbated uncertainties in the interpretation of the data by
              introducing numerous different conceptual and experimental approaches. The
              start-to-finish public nature of the debate added to the uncertainties that
              confronted fallout scientists. The "politicalization" of many scientists after
              World War 11, as well as the impact of atomic energy on American culture and
              foreign policy, gave rise to debate over the proper role of the scientist in
              society. Scientists differed not only in their scientific interpretation of the
              data, but also in their opinions on how and to whom their interpretations
              should be communicated. The fallout controversy was a prototype of future
              controversies over environmental and health hazards such as nuclear power and
              global warming. Support for this project will fund trips to examine key
              scientific papers and archival documents related to them.
