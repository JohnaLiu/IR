Abstract    :
              Over the last decade, the USSR has split into 15 new independent countries with
              distinct borders, varying kinds and levels of resources, diverse political and
              economic regimes, and different degrees of success and failure in meeting the
              challenges of post-socialism.  Within every new country, though to varying
              degrees, the old command economy and party-state have undergone substantial
              change and the environment shaping people's lives has become radically
              different.  This transition from a rather uniform social space to a new and
              diverse social landscape offers a unique natural experiment, and an
              unprecedented opportunity to understand why some people are successful in
              taking advantage of new emerging economic opportunities, whereas others fail to
              cope with the new environment, experience downward mobility, become
              impoverished, and develop pessimistic and negative views about their life and
              the new social world.  This study takes advantage of the opportunity to study
              these changes using a unique data set.  The "Paths of a Generation" surveys
              have followed samples of a cohort of adolescents since shortly before secondary
              school graduation.  The first wave of interviews in 1983-1984 was followed by a
              second wave in 1988-89 during the declining days of the USSR, a third wave in
              1993-1994 in the early years of the post-socialist period, and a fourth wave in
              1997-1999 when the adolescents had reached young adulthood.  The surveys
              contain data on roughly 13,000 respondents in seven diverse post-Soviet
              countries.  The project analyzes these data by considering how social
              background and early life experiences affect later employment, income, and
              material well being of this generation during a period of rapid change from
              socialism to capitalism.
