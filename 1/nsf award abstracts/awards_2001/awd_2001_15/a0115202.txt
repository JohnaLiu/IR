Abstract    :
              The Cleveland Municipal School District's (CMSD) proposal was developed to use
              the successes of the Urban Systemic Initiative (USI) and the lessons learned
              from the implementation of the Language Arts and English standards to improve
              education in science and mathematics.  Hence, building on those efforts, the
              intent is to bring systemic change to science and mathematics at the district
              level at an accelerated pace by: (1) using high-quality inquiry-driven and
              technology-rich curriculum, instruction, and assessment materials aligned with
              local mathematics, science, and technology standards; (2) supporting the
              recruitment and retention of K-12 teachers under a professional development
              learning environment; (3) reallocating existing resources to support the
              Cleveland USP; (4) mobilizing community stakeholders to support teachers in
              their efforts to instill effective and technology-rich science and mathematics
              learning for students; and (5) ensuring that all students will meet or exceed
              the state's proficiency standards (and local) for academic achievement in
              science and mathematics.  

As a result of the three-stage process, the
              proposal did not received ratings sufficient to recommend full funding. 
              However, the National Science Foundation agreed to support the District via a
              highly monitored, task-specific technical assistance grant as suggested by the
              site visit team for stage three of the review process.  The aim of the grant is
              to assist the school system in advancing its capacity to provide a solid
              science and mathematics education for all students.  The targets of this highly
              specific support is directed toward: 

(1) Building leadership capacity in
              science and mathematics particularly at the middle district level; and 
(2)
              Accelerating the modification and implementation of the draft standards in
              science and mathematics.  

The duration of the grant is 12 months at a level
              of $500,000.
