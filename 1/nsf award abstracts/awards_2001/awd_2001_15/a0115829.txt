Abstract    :
              For reasons of cost, scale, function, and foreign policy, the governments of
              Japan and the United States are increasingly relying on each other as partners
              in what were previously considered to be primarily national technological
              projects such as defense and space. Through a comparative study of U.S.-Japan
              collaboration in environmental remote-sensing satellites and fighter aircraft,
              this dissertation research project analyzes how the practices and processes of
              building technological systems constitute intergovernmental relations that are
              often subsumed under the label of "alliance." No previous academic study in
              English or Japanese has addressed this question in an empirical fashion. The
              project uses an interdisciplinary theoretical approach drawing from the fields
              of science and technology studies, technology management, and international
              relations theory. The contention is that an understanding of technological
              practices in collaborative projects is essential for interpretations,
              explanations, and prescriptions about the political role of technology.
              Scientists, engineers, and program managers create transnational technological
              practices and technologies that bring together knowledge and politics to build
              a heterogeneous and multifaceted alliance. Between state and transnational
              community, a U.S.-Japan alliance is built with technology.
