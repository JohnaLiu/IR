Abstract    :
              A recently built instrument capable of measuring atmospheric OH (hydroxyl
              radical), H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), and HNO3 (nitric acid) will be deployed during
              the 2001 Summer intensive of PROPHET (Program for Research on Oxidants:
              Photochemistry, Emissions, and Transport) in Northern Michigan. The measurement
              technique is based on chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS). In earlier
              PROPHET campaigns, measurements using a fluorescence-based technique showed the
              surprising result of measurable levels of OH during the night. Deploying this
              fundamentally different technique could confirm the occurrence of nighttime OH
              under the conditions of the PROPHET site. The measurements of H2SO4 will
              complement ongoing aerosol measurements, and the measurements of HNO3 would
              complement measurements of other individual compounds in the reactive nitrogen
              (NOy) family.
