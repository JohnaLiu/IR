This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of
              Minnesota at Duluth will provide support for acquisition of a towed, profiling
              vehicle with physical, biological and chemical sensors for environmental and
              lacustrine research.  It will also support the acquisition of an instrument for
              studying physical microstructure and turbulence in lake waters.  These
              instruments will be managed and operated as shared-use research facilities,
              available to all funded users of the UMD Large Lakes Observatory's research
              vessel Blue Heron, which is operated as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) academic research fleet.  UMD will
              contribute cost-sharing of more than 30% of the cost of this project from
              non-federal funds.
