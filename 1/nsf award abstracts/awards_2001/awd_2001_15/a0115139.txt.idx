Abstract    :
              Das 0115139  As traditional integrated circuit technology reaches both
              physical and economic limits, nanotechnology is increasingly being viewed as an
              enabling technology to complement the next generation of electronic devices.
              The objective of this project is to identify barrier issues associated with the
              integration of nonlithographic nanostructure fabrication technologies and RF
              integrated circuits. This will be accomplished through an experimental
              investigation of the effects of an electrochemical nanostructure fabrication
              technique on the performance of an RF transceiver circuit fabricated using
              standard CMOS and SiGe technology. The results of this investigation will help
              identify technological issues which must be addressed for the integration of
              nonlithographic nanostructrues within RF circuit designs.
