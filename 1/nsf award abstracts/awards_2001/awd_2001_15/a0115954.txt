Abstract


This project
              involves an integrated study including experiments, analysis and simulations to
              develop a fundamental understanding of the effects introduced by material
              property gradients on the static and dynamic fracture behavior of functionally
              graded materials (FGMs). Two distinct material systems, exhibiting
              brittle-to-ductile transitions will be used:  polymer-based (ECO) and
              ceramic/metal based (ZrO2/steel) FGMs. A detailed investigation of the effects
              of microstructure as a function of manufacturing processes and processing
              history on the macroscopic properties of the FGM will be conducted. The
              modeling involves development of a novel cohesive volumetric finite element
              (CVFE) code tailored for FGMs. All the work is developed in conjunction with an
              educational program.
