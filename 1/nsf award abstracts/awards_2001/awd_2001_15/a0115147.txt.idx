Abstract    :
              This project proposes a study of how firms search for and discover opportunities
              to innovate. More specifically, the researchers seek to understand the role of
              employee motivation in this process. Building on behavioral research on
              individual-level innovativeness and search research on organizational-level
              innovation, they ask how intrinsically-motivated employees search for
              innovations, and how their process differs from that of extrinsically-motivated
              employees. The project will also examine whether differences in motivation can
              explain the occurrence of more radical innovations. Three topics are to be
              examined: 1. What are the characteristics and phases of the search and
              discovery process? 2. How and in what ways is motivation linked to the search
              and discovery process? 3. Can the search and discovery process be
              outsourced? Two detailed case studies, a field study and laboratory studies
              will be utilized to obtain important new multilevel, real-world evidence of the
              search and discovery process, in contrast to much past individual-level work on
              innovation which has been based primarily on laboratory studies. These
              extensions of existing theory will help to establish the role of individual and
              firm determinants of search and their interdependencies. This is the first
              study that examines individual search processes related to intrinsic/extrinsic
              motivation and resultant radicality of innovation. The study will also extend
              inquiry beyond problem-solving to other significant, but less-researched phases
              of the innovation search process, and provide evidence for how to select for
              and motivate people in teams that target different types of innovations.
