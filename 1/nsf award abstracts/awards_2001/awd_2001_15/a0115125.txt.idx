Abstract    :
              This project traces the contentious debate between Frangois Arago and
              JeanBaptiste Biot over the nature of light in the first half of the nineteenth
              century. Although often presented as a brief and pointed clash over the
              particle and wave theories of light, their long-standing disagreement was in
              fact rooted in the issues of practice: whether the images they produced in
              their optical instruments were transparently available to all, or only to those
              who knew precisely how light worked. This work explores the ways in which
              optical instruments, and the associated material culture and bodily techniques,
              participated in dividing the world into domains of visibility and invisibility,
              and how this in turn functioned on a political level as a mechanism of
              inclusion and exclusion. Both Arago and Biot were explicit in tying their
              respective commitments to transparency and mystery to claims about who was
              qualified to speak on worldly matters, and thus who belonged within the bounds
              of the communicative public represented by the state.
