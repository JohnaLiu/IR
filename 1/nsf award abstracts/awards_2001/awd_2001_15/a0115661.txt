Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative research project between three universities. The project
              is a comprehensive, systemic research and development program addressing three
              inter-related tiers of study: student learning and development; teacher
              beliefs, knowledge, and practice; and professional development.  The project is
              grounded in both sound theory of how students develop algebraic reasoning and
              acquire domain knowledge and skills and in the beliefs and existing practices
              of teachers.  In the student tier a detailed developmental model of students'
              evolving algebraic reasoning and skill acquisition will be constructed
              concentrating on the transition from arithmetic to algebraic reasoning. In the
              teaching tier a promising pedagogical approach, Bridging Instruction, will be
              tested. In the professional development tier a teacher professional development
              prototype will be implemented. The prototypeT extends an existing technology
              based approach. It enables the evaluation of a scalable model of teacher
              professional development. Technology is a central aspect of this project.  The
              findings of this research will be implemented into a coherent educational
              program for students and teachers using Algebra Cognitive Tutors and the STEP
              web teacher professional development environments.
