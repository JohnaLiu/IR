This Major Research Instrumentation award to Alaska Pacific
              University will provide support for development of an autonomous underwater
              vehicle for study of marine animal behavior.  In collaboration with researchers
              from University of Arizona and Colorado School of Mines, the team will develop
              a remotely-controlled vehicle for following and recording by video technique
              the behavior of tagged individuals of the Giant Pacific Octopus, Enteroctopus
              dofleini.  Once developed and tested, it is expected that this instrumentation
              may be applied to behavioral and ecological research on a wide array of marine
              organisms, many of which are very difficult for humans to observe directly in
              their native habitats.
