Abstract    :
              
This is a collaborative research project between three universities. The
              project is a comprehensive, systemic research and development program
              addressing three inter-related tiers of study: student learning and
              development; teacher beliefs, knowledge, and practice; and professional
              development.  The project is grounded in both sound theory of how students
              develop algebraic reasoning and acquire domain knowledge and skills and in the
              beliefs and existing practices of teachers.  In the student tier a detailed
              developmental model of students' evolving algebraic reasoning and skill
              acquisition will be constructed concentrating on the transition from arithmetic
              to algebraic reasoning. In the teaching tier a promising pedagogical approach,
              Bridging Instruction, will be tested. In the professional development tier a
              teacher professional development prototype will be implemented. The prototypeT
              extends an existing technology based approach. It enables the evaluation of a
              scalable model of teacher professional development. Technology is a central
              aspect of this project.  The findings of this research will be implemented into
              a coherent educational program for students and teachers using Algebra
              Cognitive Tutors and the STEP web teacher professional development
              environments.
