Description:  This award supports the US-India Workshop:
              Region and Regional Consciousness in India, Pune, India, December 2001.  The
              conveners are PI Anne Feldhaus, Arizona State University and coPI Rajendra
              Vora, University of Pune, India.  This symposium will bring together scholars
              from the humanities and social sciences that are researching various aspects of
              conceptualization and loyalty to regions in India.  They will examine regions
              from differing disciplinary perspectives and a variety of scales with the goal
              of advancing understanding of ways in which people express, create, and foster
              a sense of their area as a distinct and coherent unit to which they belong.    
                   

Scope:  The symposium will foster new institutional arrangements
              between Arizona State University and the University of Pune that will promote
              collaborative research in the near future including the convening of a
              follow-up symposium at Arizona State University, December 2003.  This symposium
              will also provide an occasion for the founding of the Centre for the Study of
              Regions in Pune.  Participants include senior and junior scholars, and recent
              Ph.Ds. This award is supported by the Division of International Programs and
              the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences.
