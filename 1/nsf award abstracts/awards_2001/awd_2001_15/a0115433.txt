This award provides funding support for the operation of
              the Northeast National Ion Microprobe Facility (NENIMF) at Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution.  This multi-user facility is open to qualified
              researchers who need the special capabilities of a large-radius CAMECA 1270 ion
              microprobe instrument, e.g., precise trace element and isotopic analyses
              combined with spatial resolution of sampling on the order of approximately 10
              microns. Research applications by the Woods Hole hosts and the U.S. earth
              science research community is expected to include studies of mantle
              geochemistry, oceanic volcanism, island arc volcanism, layered mafic
              intrusions, and geochronology of a wide variety of materials.
