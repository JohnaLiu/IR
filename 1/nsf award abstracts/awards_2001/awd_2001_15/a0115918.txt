This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation
              (MRI) Program, provides support for the acquisition of state-of-the-art
              instrumentation which will be used to integrate research on the Kanawha River
              Project into the educational experience of undergraduate environmental science
              majors at the University of Charleston (West Virginia) and K-12 students and
              teachers within the Appalachian region. Specifically, a graphite furnace atomic
              absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) and a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer
              (GC/MS) will be purchased. The AAS will be used to carry out metal studies on
              the Kanawha River. Students will measure trace levels of lead, mercury, cadmium
              and also monitor other metals, including calcium, iron, magnesium, and tin. The
              GC/MS will be used to determine levels of organic pollutants in the river,
              including polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorinated dioxins and furans,
              pesticides, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. This instrument will also be used to
              help identify other contaminants in the river. A series of river-based research
              projects will enrich the educational experiences of undergraduate environmental
              science majors at the University of Charleston.  The instrumentation will also
              be used in ongoing outreach projects that will bring area teachers and students
              on campus to participate in a variety of environmental science experiments and
              research activities.
