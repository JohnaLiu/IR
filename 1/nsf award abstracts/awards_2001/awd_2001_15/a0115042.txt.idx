Abstract    :
              The proposal initiates a partnership to support an LSAMP Phase I alliance of
              institutions to increase enrollment, retention, and graduation of
              underrepresented minority undergraduate students in SMET. The partnership
              institutions are University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Northeastern University,
              the University of Rhode Island, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The goal
              of the alliance is to double the current SMET student enrollment by
              underrepresented minorities (845) in five years, and to significantly increase
              (toward doubling) the number of SMET degrees awarded (120 in 2000).
