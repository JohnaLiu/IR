Abstract    :
              0115035 Happell This award to University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of
              Marine and Atmospheric Sciences provides support to "Operation SWAB," a program
              to test research ships and laboratories for low-level radioisotope
              contamination.  The support provided here helps ensure that samples collected
              and analyzed for low level tracer studies will not be contaminated by spills of
              tritium or radiocarbon on the ship or in the lab.  The program has been ongoing
              for twenty years, and this award extends it for an additional five years.
