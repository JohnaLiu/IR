Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Carleton College will acquire an aerosol
              time-of-flight mass spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a
              number of areas including a) the study of the chemical content and source
              origin of aerosol particles found in the Carleton College area; b) the
              exploration of wet deposition of particles through both rain and snow washout;
              and c) the study of the emissions from diesel engines as a function of various
              operating parameters.  

A deeper understanding of aerosol particles in the
              atmosphere is crucial to understanding the environment and health effects. 
              This project will provide opportunities for Carleton College undergraduates, in
              collaboration with undergraduates and graduate students from the University of
              Wisconsin - Madison, and senior scientists from both institutions to work
              together.
