Abstract    :
              Techniques for the monitoring and control of voltage stability in electric power
              systems operating in a stressed environment will be developed. Emphasis will be
              placed on the use of probe signals to detect impending loss of stability and
              using the resultin warning signals in closed-loop control for system
              stabilization. Through such a signal-based approach, reliance on availability
              of accurate models and on extensive off-line computations is reduced. New
              control laws for stabilizing power systems near voltage instability will be
              developed. In previous research, the PI and his students have made important
              contributions to the theory of bifurcation control and, more recently, have
              coupled this with stability monitoring. In this proposal research project,
              these results will be applied to detection and control of impending instability
              in stressed electric power networks. One major departure from previous work is
              the emphasis on detection of instabilities before they are actually
              encountered, and achieving this with a signal- rather than purely model-based
              technique. Additionally, it is expected that new contributions to the theory
              will also naturally result from analytical problems motivated by the power
              system application.
