Abstract    :
              The Portland Public Schools (PPS) District is the largest district in the state
              of Oregon. It has an enrollment of almost 55,000 students in 64 elementary
              schools, 20 middle schools, 12 high schools and an increasing number of special
              focus and alternative programs. Of these schools 55 qualify for Title I
              assistance while approximately 49% of elementary students, 37% of middle school
              students and 28% of high school students participate in free/reduced lunch
              programs. Currently an estimated 38% of the students stem from minority
              backgrounds. PPS employs over 3,100 certified teachers and the district serves
              over 90% of Portland's eligible population. The district has used the PASS
              college entrance requirements as the academic target of all students for a
              number of years. The goals of the Portland USP are: 1. To enable the
              district's entire diverse student enrollment to meet rigorous K-12 standards in
              science and mathematics and prepare for post-secondary education and future
              careers. To significantly reduce disparities in participation and academic
              performance between various student populations. 2. To increase the district's
              capacity to develop, support, and sustain teacher and principal leadership in
              implementing standards-based curricular reform and continuous improvement of
              K-12 science, mathematics and technology education for all students. 3. To
              engage families and the community in supporting improved student performance in
              science and mathematics and improved access to high-quality, inquiry-based
              educational opportunities in science, mathematics and technology. 4. To
              establish ongoing, collaborative partnerships with higher education,
              business/industry, policy makers, and other key stakeholders in support of
              exemplary, research-based teaching and learning in science, mathematics, and
              technology within the context of a large and diverse urban school
              district.  To reach these goals, some of the implementation strategies that
              will be used by the Portland USP during the first year are: a. After-school
              academic assistance/tutoring in both mathematics and science. b.  Parent
              education on standards-based curricula and support for students at home. c. 
              After-school workshops for teachers and principals on content knowledge and
              pedagogy. d.  Science and math courses, workshops and lecture series. e.
              Annual summer institutes (5 days in math and 5 days in science). f.
              Preparation of science and mathematics leaders.
