Abstract    :
              0115082 Lin  This is a three-year cooperative project between Dr Tien-Sung
              Lin, Washington University and Professor Chung-Yuan Mou, National Taiwan
              University, to study the  chemistry of C60, tetracene pentacene, and gold
              nanocrystals within the confines of mesoporous solids such as MCM-41 and -48
              using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) Spectroscopy. This is an important
              research in nanotechnology.  MCM-41 and -48 are interesting mesoporous
              materials with controllable tubular pore size. Such zeolite-type materials have
              been widely used in catalyst support and molecular sieve applications. 
              Advances in this area may yield substantial societal benefits.  This proposal
              also provides an opportunity for three U.S. postdoctoral scientists and three
              graduate students get valuable exposure to this field of mesoporous materials.
              This proposal addresses an important scientific question and meets the NSF
              objective of human resource development. The National Science Council of Taiwan
              and the NSF jointly support this project.
