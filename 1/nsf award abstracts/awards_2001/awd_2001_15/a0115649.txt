Abstract    :
              
The researchers propose to scale up a study they previously conducted in which
              they examined the backgrounds of college science students taking introductory
              science courses for predictors of performance, while controlling for
              demographic differences. They looked at 1,933 students at 19 colleges and
              universities in physics using epidemiological research methods. They plan to
              expand the study to 24,000 college students to examine the connection between
              the instructional decisions made by their high school physics, chemistry,  and
              biology teachers and success in college science classes.
