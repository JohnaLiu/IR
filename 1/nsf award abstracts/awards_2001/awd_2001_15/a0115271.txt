Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Tennessee in Chattanooga will
              acquire a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS). This equipment will
              enhance research in a number of areas including a) study of reaction mixtures
              of organic products; b) the study of organomercury species found in local
              reservoirs and water supplies; and c) the study of the environmental fate of
              polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  

Gas chromatograph with mass
              spectrometric detection (GC-MS) detection is an extremely powerful technique
              used for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures.  This instrument will
              substantially strengthen scientific research in the Environmental Sciences,
              Biology and Chemistry Departments at the University of Tennessee in
              Chattanooga.  It will also have a significant impact on student involvement in
              research at this primarily undergraduate institution.
