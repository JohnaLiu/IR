Abstract    :
              Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in conjunction with the National Science
              Foundation (NSF) is working to transfer the ELDORA radar and "C" band color
              weather radar from the NSF Lockheed Electra aircraft operated and maintained by
              the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), onto one of the NRL NP-3D
              aircraft.  NRL's experience in operating flying laboratories to support
              researchers in the field of meteorology and oceanography similar to NCAR's
              mission and expertise, and will allow the atmospheric research community to
              make use of ELDORA for a least another 5 to 10 years.
