Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Kalamazoo College will acquire a nanosecond laser
              system. The research activities will involve measurement of vector correlations
              in the photodissociation of volatile organometallic nitrosyls, especially the
              correlations between angular momentum and velocity and between the transition
              dipole and velocity.  The results obtained in these experiments will reveal the
              role of Jahn-Teller distortions in excited organometallic nitrosyl compounds
              and may reveal the timescale for metal-NO dissociation.  These results can be
              extended into understanding chemical vapor deposition and NO-metal interactions
              in biological systems.  Student researchers at this primarily undergraduate
              institution will participate in these studies.  

A  nanosecond laser
              provides ultrafast pulses of coherent visible or infrared light, which enables
              researchers to obtain important information about fast occurring chemical
              reactions.  Its use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the
              properties of reactive and nonreactive molecules.  These studies will have an
              impact in materials chemistry and biochemistry.
