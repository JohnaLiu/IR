Abstract    :
              Small magnetic structures are being developed for
magnetic sensors (for
              example, exploiting the
giant magnetoresistance effect, or tunneling
              magnetoresistance)
for nonvolatile memories exploiting either the Hall effect
              or magnetotransport
effects and for storage on a nano scale.
They present
              challenges in design for controlling
the value and reproducibility of the
              switching field.
Temperature effects as well as fluctuation
of the grain
              structure on a mesoscopic scale become important.
At the moment, magnetic
              nonvolatile memories are being developed by
IBM-Siemans (Infinion) and the
              Motorola Companies.
The uniformity of the switching field is a major stumbling
              block in the
commercilaiztaion of high density nonvolatile magnetic
              memories.
At the moment the yield of addressable sites is very small.
Nearly
              all current micromagnetics calculations are carried out
at zero temperature
              and do not include the temperature effects.
In addition, very few systematic
              investigation were carried out.
We propose to study and develop a way to
              predict the device
characteristics and enable their optimum design
with
              techniques that we have developed over the last several years.
These include
              (a) calculations from an analytic point of view in
combination with a finite
              temperature Monte Carlo code that we have written and
optimized; (b)
              experimental studies of the switching field
characteristics of our in-house
              e-beam patterned submicron
structures.
