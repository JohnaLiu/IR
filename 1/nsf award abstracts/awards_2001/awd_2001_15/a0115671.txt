This Major Research Instrumentation award to Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in Massachusetts will provide support for
              acquisition of mooring-related instrumentation to be managed by the Physical
              Oceanography Observing Laboratory (POOL) and made available on a shared-use
              basis to US academic researchers funded for research that requires
              oceanographic moorings.  Specific instrumentation provided with this award
              includes two moored profilers with acoustic current meters and CTDs, as well as
              forty other acoustic current meters, plus temperature and salinity sensors,
              acoustic releases and deck units for general mooring support.  WHOI will
              contribute 30% of the cost of this project from non-federal funds.
