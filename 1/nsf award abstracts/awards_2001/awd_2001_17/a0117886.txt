Lea/Abstract

Funds are provided for the PI to continue his work on
              linked Mg/Ca paleothermometry and Delta 0-18 in planktic foraminifera to
              further the understanding of climate variability in the Pacific and Atlantic
              Oceans on millennial and orbital time scales using four cores from Ceara Rise,
              Cariaco Basin, Galapagos Platform and Carnegie Ridge. The PI will deconvolve
              the temperature and salinity paleorecords in the tropical western Atlantic and
              eastern Pacific by measuring the Mg/Ca and d18-0 in foraminifera from these
              four sites. The PI also hopes that the results of the proposed research will
              enable him to address issues related to the Pacific-Atlantic salinity
              differences on millennial. and orbital time scales.
