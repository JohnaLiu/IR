Adaptive Representations for Genetic Algorithms and Local
              Search




This is the first year funding of a three year continuing
              award.   The PI's recent theoretical results prove there are advantages to
              reflected Gray codes compared to standard binary encodings when used as a
              representation for search and parameter optimization problems (e.g., it is
              possible to use a simple mechanism to escape local optima by adaptively
              switching between different reflected Gray codes).   Preliminary empirical
              results indicate that using high precision adaptive Gray codes leads to better
              optimization, and new convergence results have been proven.    In this project,
              a family of high precision adaptive Gray codes will be developed for use with
              genetic algorithms and local search.    The PI will further conduct a broad
              comparative evaluation of evolutionary algorithms, local search and other
              heuristic search methods that do not require derivative information.    A
              real-world application will be addressed related to a new generation of much
              more accurate weather prediction systems.   The CloudSat project will in the
              next few years deploy a satellite-based system for modeling cloud structures,
              and the search methods developed in this project will be the best and fastest
              way to solve a key inverse problem which lies at the heart of such models, as a
              consequence of which they appear to be likely candidates for inclusion in the
              scheduled 2003 deployment of CloudSat.
