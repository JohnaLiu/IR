This project is an attempt to get direct information
              about isopycnal dispersion and property fluxes in the ocean, over scales from
              O(1) Km to O(100) Km, by deploying clusters of isopycnal RAFOS floats.  Over
              their two-year missions, these floats will map out the turbulent flow along two
              different density surfaces in a region of the eastern, tropical Atlantic,
              roughly 1400Km west of Africa.  The floats will measure position, pressure,
              temperature and oxygen.  Data on the trajectories of the floats, together with
              data from a hydrographic survey carried out at the time of float deployment,
              will be analyzed to provide estimates of absolute and relative dispersion rates
              as well as strain, vorticity and mean flow.  Fluxes of temperature and oxygen
              will also be estimated.  The experimental region coincides with the edge of a
              tongue of low oxygen water that stretches westward from the African coast.  A
              secondary objective of the work is to obtain a better description of the low
              oxygen tongue and, by obtaining data about flow and eddy fluxes, determine the
              processes responsible for its structure.
