Abstract    :
              Science Summary:  This proposal requests support to construct a detailed 14C
              calibration data set for the period from 15 - 55 calendar Kyr BP using
              sediments of the tropical Cariaco Basin.  The varved sediments of the Cariaco
              Basin allow annual resolution.  Paleoclimate records from the Caricaco Basin
              show identical variation to detailed records from the GISP2 ice core.  The
              study will obtain a series of high-resolution radiocarbon dates from Cariaco
              Basin and calibrate them to the chronology of the GISP2 ice core record.
