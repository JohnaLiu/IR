This is a project intended to analyze data from two
              deployments of Lagrangian floats in the surface mixed layer.  One deployment
              consisted of three floats and the other, two.  It is anticipated that
              additional data will come from an ONR-funded experiment in 2002.  The intention
              is to look at the relation between turbulent kinetic energy in the mixed layer,
              the structure of mixed layer turbulence, wind stress, and surface wave
              activity. The dependence of entrainment rate on wind and surface waves will
              also be studied.   The approach used involves examining spectra of w, du/dz,
              and density perturbations at different levels in the mixed layer (near the
              surface, in the interior, and near the base of the mixed layer) where different
              dynamics are expected to prevail (surface waves, homogeneous turbulence,
              internal waves).  The project also includes an attempt to examine vertical heat
              and salt budgets.  As part of this project, numerical simulations of the mixed
              layer, Large-Eddy Simulations will be made.  These simulations will be compared
              to data derived from the floats with the aim of testing new parameterizations
              of the effects of surface waves and of the influence of stratification on
              mixed-layer turbulence.
