Abstract    :
              Because state governments can play an important role in national development,
              and most Third World states were created during colonialism, colonial state
              legacies likely shape post-colonial development in the modern Third World. 
              Moreover, because colonial rule occurred in diverse forms throughout the world,
              its effects on post-colonial development likely vary from case to case.  For
              example, among the British colonies, some were allowed direct rule and some
              only indirect rule.  This project examines the effects in British colonies of
              the form of legal domination on later development of the economy, social
              welfare state, and democratic polity.  The investigator collects and analyzes
              quantitative data on these relationships for all former British colonies still
              under British domination in 1955.  The investigator also collects and analyzes
              colonial documents in Kenya, Sierra Leone, Mauritius, and Botswana to further
              explore the relationships with qualitative data.
