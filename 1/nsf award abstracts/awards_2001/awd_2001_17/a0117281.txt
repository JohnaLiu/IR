Abstract    :
              Arabidopsis thaliana is a plant model organism that has become a major research
              tool for plant
Biologists. A primary motivation for the sequencing of
              Arabidopsis was that it would serve as a reference for other plant genomes. For
              this to be realized the functions of a large number of unknown and hypothetical
              genes must be deduced and a cross-reference between genes in Arabidopsis and
              other plant species provided. Ultimately, the development of the data resources
              will lead to a better understanding of gene expressions and function in
              plants.

Predicted genes will be amplified and used to construct a whole
              genome microarray that will be used to look at patterns of gene express through
              the plant life cycle. Expressions data can help provide both functional
              assignments for genes and used in identifying metabolic pathways. The data will
              be analyzed using a suite of clustering and pattern recognition tool. A number
              of databases will be combined and integrated to provide a web-based view of
              gene expression and identification in Arabidopsis.
