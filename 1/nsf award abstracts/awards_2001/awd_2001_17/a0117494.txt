Abstract    :
              This research focuses on the use of sonification to increase trust between
              humans and automated systems. Sonification is analogous to visualization and
              surpasses traditional auditory warnings by conveying a rich array of continuous
              dynamic information. The concept of trust provides a theoretical basis for
              using sonification to reveal the capabilities of automated systems and promote
              appropriate reliance. There are four objectives, 1) identify how sonification
              can calibrate trust, 2) expand the understanding of trust and its role in
              human-automation partnerships, 3) apply dynamical systems theory to describe
              human-automation coordination, and 4) evaluate the generality of sonfication
              for settings in which multiple people share control of automated systems. The
              proposed work contributes to the scientific basis of sonification and its
              relation to group dynamics and should benefit society by increasing human
              safety in automated environments.
