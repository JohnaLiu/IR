Abstract    :
              In aiming to explain the existence of environmental inequality - the
              disproportionate location of environmental hazards near low income and minority
              neighborhoods - this project contrasts two theories.  One is based on direct
              racial discrimination, and another is based on the indirect consequences of
              housing inequality by class and race.  The evaluation of the contrasting
              theories comes from the analysis of data from three sources.  One source
              identifies the location of toxic facilities, another provides figures on home
              ownership, and a third uses figures from the U.S. census.  With data over the
              1940-1990 period for eight selected areas, the analysis examines the
              relationship between housing segregation and environmental inequality.  The
              results not only help evaluate the alternative theories and the relative roles
              of class and race in promoting environmental inequality, but also address
              policy options in alleviating the problem.
