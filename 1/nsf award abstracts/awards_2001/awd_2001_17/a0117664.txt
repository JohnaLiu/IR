Abstract    :
              Gas hydrates are important as a potential resource, and also because of their
              possible influence on climate and the global carbon cycle. Their formation is
              well understood, but their source(s) is not. Pore waters associated with gas
              hydrates have elevated halogen content, making dating by 129I (AMS) feasible,
              as has been shown by a pilot study. The idea of this proposal is to date the
              pore waters and to use their chemistry and that of the sediments to begin to
              unravel the origin of methane hydrates. Japanese collaborators will provide
              samples and data relevant to the study. In this proposal, the PI requests
              support for the sample preparation (Rochester) and AMS dating to be done at
              Purdue Univ.
