Abstract    :
              New initial paleornagrictic results froni ODP Leg 72 estimate the pattern of
              secular variation for the entire Brunhes Epoch and identi I'v 13 Brunhes-aged
              magnetic field excursions. This is the first data set that allows ~i
              directional look at secular variations over such a ]on - time interval and a!
              lows consideration within the framework of excursions and paleointenslt~.
              Detailed anilysis ol'thc individtitif excursion records suggests that there are
              two basically different types ol, cxcursions, one t\ t~c that is closely
              related to normal secular variation and another type that nilght he considei Cd
              an aborted reversal. The project will analyze and s\ nthesize PIVVIOLIS
              palcornagnetic rcults and make selective new discretesample ineastirements on
              cleven exci-ii-sions and fh(,iii, contiguous secular variation.
