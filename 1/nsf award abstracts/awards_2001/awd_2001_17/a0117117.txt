Abstract    :
              This proposal is for the continuation of the development, calibration, testing,
              and deployment of in situ chemical sensors to make measurements at hydrothermal
              vents, especially instruments that can be left in place for long periods of
              monitoring, consistent with the evolving strategies involving long time series
              measurements. To now, successfully developed instruments measure H2, H2S, and
              pH. In this proposal the PIs propose to make these existing instruments
              smaller, more robust, and better suited for long deployments. In addition they
              propose to develop, calibrate and test new sensors to measure pH based on
              Ir/IrO2 and Ti/TiO2 materials, a new Na ion sensor made of NASICON ceramic
              (which can also serve as a reference electrode for pH measurements), and an
              electrochemical CO2 sensor. Developing successful instruments will require
              longer term testing and calibration and in situ testing at actual hydrothermal
              vents.
