Abstract    :
              In exploring the sources of political democracy in developing nations, this
              project examines how religion indirectly promoted democracy in former British
              colonies.   Because religious groups gained more independence from state
              control in British (and American) colonies, they had more power to fight for
              their interests in dealing with governments in the colonizing nations.  For
              example, despite the opposition of most colonial governments, religious groups
              in British colonies advocated mass education in order to foster conversion. 
              This led to high literacy rates and successful democracies in the colonized
              countries.  To test these arguments, the project gathers data on education from
              missionary records, and merges the data with digitalized maps of British
              colonies.  It also collects and codes reports from missionary committees.  The
              findings help identify the mechanisms behind diverse colonial outcomes and
              contribute to literature on world systems and cultural imperialism.
