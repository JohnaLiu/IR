Abstract    :
              Workshop: Scaling photosynthesis from the chloroplast to the
              landscape

Understanding the interactions of plant form and photosynthetic
              function among different species will be critical to the success of future
              management of both native and agricultural species, especially under current
              scenarios of global change. The purpose of this workshop is to evaluate
              photosynthetic limitations and adaptive solutions that emerge at the higher
              levels of structural organization found in the plant kingdom.  The workshop
              will be held in conjunction with the 12th International Congress on
              Photosynthesis in Brisbane, Australia (August 18-23, 2001) and will be divided
              into sessions dealing with the chloroplast, cell, cell layers inside a leaf,
              the leaf, crown, canopy, and landscape.  Across this broad structural/spatial
              hierarchy, chloroplasts are packaged progressively into more and more complex
              levels of organization (e.g. cells, leaves, branches, and crowns), generating
              new limitations to light and CO2 capture for photosynthesis.
