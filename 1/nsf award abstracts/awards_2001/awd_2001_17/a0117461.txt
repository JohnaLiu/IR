Abstract    :
              Rural producers of primary commodities face increasingly unfavorable and
              volatile terms of world trade, and the resulting poverty causes both social and
              ecological deterioration.  A growing fair trade movement offers a model of more
              sustainable rural development by building alternative trade relations between
              Southern producers and Northern consumers.  The trade bypasses traditional
              intermediaries, thus returning a larger proportion of the purchase price to
              small farmers, directing capital to local development, and protecting the
              environment with sustainable practices.  However, the consequences of these
              fair trade practices have not been studied.  This project assesses the social
              and environmental benefits of fair trade markets by comparing conventional and
              alternative production of coffee and cocoa by peasant farmer cooperatives in
              Chiapas, Mexico, and Beni, Bolivia.  In making the assessment, the analysis
              combines qualitative and quantitative field research at eight producer
              cooperatives in these locations.  The results provide information on the
              consequences of economic globalization for small agricultural producers.  They
              also suggest how alternative trade arrangements can deal with those
              consequences.
