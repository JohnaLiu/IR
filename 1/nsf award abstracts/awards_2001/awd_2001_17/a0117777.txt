Digital Government: Challenges
              in Statistical Digital Government: A Workshop promoting Agency-Research
              institution interaction

This workshop will bring together the grantee
              researchers in the Digital Government program who are working in areas related
              to the collection, maintenance, delivery and use of statistical data. 
              Attendees will include researchers and agency employees and upper-level
              managers.  The research technologies developed under theses grants in their
              first year or two will be demonstrated and there will be an opportunity to
              discuss mechanisms for transitioning these laboratory technologies to
              operational production at the participating agencies.  In addition,
              participants will discuss and bring up to date a research agenda for work on
              information technologies in statistical settings
