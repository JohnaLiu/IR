This project will analyze data from repeated
              transects across the 
continental shelf and upper slope off the East Coast of
              the U.S. These 
will be used to study the structure and variability of the
              shelf-break 
front and the flows on either side of this front.  The data
              consist of  
over 700 sections of ADCP data, collected over approximately 9
              years from
a container ship making routine trips between New York and Bermuda,
              
together with XBT data spanning two decades.   In addition to providing
              
information about the short-term variability of the circulation in this
              
region, this unique data set should permit the study of the inter-annual
              
variability of a current system that affects conditions in the 
economically
              important and biologically
