This project is a study of how the dynamics of a
              thermohaline intrusion changes as a function of stratification, shear strength,
              and ambient turbulence.  A particular focus is the interaction between
              salt-fingers and mechanically generated turbulence and the way the two combine
              to produce vertical fluxes.   The study will be carried out in a laboratory
              setting designed to permit the detailed observation of an arrested wedge of
              cold, fresh water in an ambient warm, salty flow.  Experiments will be
              conducted with and without turbulence generated by stationary and oscillating
              grids.   The experiment seeks to obtain a qualitative and quantitative
              description of a ubiquitous oceanic phenomenon that is difficult to observe in
              situ.  If successful, it will provide significant insight into the mixing of
              water masses with different temperature and salinity properties.
