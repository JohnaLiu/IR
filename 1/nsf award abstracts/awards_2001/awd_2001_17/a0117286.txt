This workshop brings together scientists
              from the circumpolar North to compare different approaches to the valuation
              process for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems protected as wilderness. Also
              included are land managers, students, and local decision-makers.  The goals are
              to assess the state of knowledge of wilderness valuation; explore the roles of
              nature tourism, ecological protection, and human-environment relationships
              among local and indigenous societies; compare national, regional, and local
              policy dimensions of wilderness resource use allocation; and develop a common
              framework for analysis of cross-disciplinary, circumpolar wilderness protection
              issues.
