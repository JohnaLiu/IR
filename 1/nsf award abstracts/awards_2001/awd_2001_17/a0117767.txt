This project will complete the data assembly, verification,
              adjustments, examination by data quality experts, documentation, availability
              and archive of hydrographic and tracers data collected by the World Ocean
              Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Program (WHP). As the WOCE program
              winds down at the end of 2002, the WHP Office will complete the clean-up of the
              repeat Hydrography data set, prepare the WHP contents for the final WOCE CD-ROM
              (version 3) and will transition the activities of the office to optimally the
              anticipated needs of the Climate Variability and predictability (CLIVAR)
              program as it ramps up its re-survey activities. The WHP office enables
              discovery and understanding by making the high-quality WOCE data set freely
              available together with the appropriate documentation and tools that also
              facilitates teaching.  This activity not only supports the WOCE community but
              also enables research and teaching more broadly across many areas of physical
              oceanography, the application of oceanographic knowledge to climate issues and
              its application in biological issues.  It enables research and teaching across
              the full spectrum of US institutions and also internationally.
