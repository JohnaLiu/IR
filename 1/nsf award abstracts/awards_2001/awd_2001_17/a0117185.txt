Abstract    :
              Since the 1980s, job stability for American workers has been falling as
              employers pursue increased flexibility in employment systems.  Traditionally
              vulnerable groups such as young workers and blacks have experienced the largest
              decreases in stability, but even hitherto stable workers such as older managers
              and professionals have been affected.  This project investigates the economic
              consequences of frequent job changes for workers who first entered the labor
              market in the early 1980s.  Because worker and labor market characteristics
              shape the relationship between mobility and wages, the economic effects of
              instability are unlikely to be uniform.  The project thus explores the
              conditions under which job instability creates better or worse wage
              outcomes.

Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth from 1979
              to 1998, the analysis identifies how three main contextual factors shape the
              relationship between mobility patterns and wage profiles: 1) workers' reasons
              for changing jobs, 2) patterns of job change, 3) and types of labor markets in
              which the changes occur.  The results offer theoretical insights into the
              consequences of economic change for worker well-being, and policy implications
              for addressing the needs of workers without a permanent employer.
