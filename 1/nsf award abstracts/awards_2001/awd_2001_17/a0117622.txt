Description:  This award supports US-India
              cooperative research entitled "Modeling Flocculation-Dispersion of Colloidal
              Suspensions in a Particle Population Balance Framework."  Flocculation and
              dispersion of colloidal suspensions are important unit operations in many
              industrial activities such as pulp and papermaking, mineral and ceramics
              processing, and water treatment.  The investigators will undertake a detailed
              study of the nine enumerated steps in the flocculation/dispersion process. 
              They will develop a comprehensive mathematical model that includes a variety of
              phenomena such as aggregation, interparticle forces, hydrodynamics and polymer
              adsorption.  Although flocculation processes have been extensively modeled, the
              proposed work will be the first attempt to integrate the various subprocesses. 
              The new model will be validated by comparison with existing experimental data. 
              Predictions from the model will then be tested by performing new experiments.
              

Scope:  The collaborators for this research are P. Somasundaran, Columbia
              University and P. Pradip and P.C. Kapur, Tata Research Design and Development
              Centre, Pune, India.  The PIs are a team of world class scientists that have an
              excellent chance of achieving their research objectives.  Development of a
              comprehensive model to predict the kinetics of flocculation will be very useful
              for water purification, waste treatment, product formulation, mineral
              beneficiation schemes, and environmental remediation. 
This project is jointly
              funded by the Division of International Programs and the Government of India's
              Department of Science & Technology.
