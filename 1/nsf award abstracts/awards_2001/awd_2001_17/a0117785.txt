Abstract    :
              Although China and South Korea share Confucian values, China has a socialist
              economy while South Korea has a market economy.  These different types of
              economic and political systems translate into different policies regarding
              gender equality, women's employment, childcare, and housework in families.  Do
              these different systems and policies produce differences in gender roles and
              family relations in the two countries?  This project addresses that question by
              examining father's participation in childcare, the division of housework, and
              gender attitudes in China and South Korea.  To do so, it uses quantitative data
              from large samples, and qualitative data from small focus groups in each
              nation.  The results not only provide a more detailed description of national
              differences in gender and family roles in Asia, but also offer insights into
              the public policy and economic sources of these differences.
