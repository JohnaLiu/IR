This project is a descriptive
              analysis of the structure of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) system and
              its connection to adjacent southern hemisphere circulation domains.  It will
              use the Southern Ocean sections obtained during the Hydrographic Program of the
              World Ocean Circulation Experiment, as well as historical data sets. The
              analysis will follow five themes: a description of the abyssal circulation,
              including deep and bottom water pathways to mid-latitudes; a study of the
              pathways of exchange of deep water across the ACC; the transformation, by
              ventilation and mixing, of warm water along the ACC; exchange between the ACC
              and subtropical gyres; secular changes in the structure of the Southern Ocean. 
               This work will help determine the role played by the Southern Ocean in
              establishing the density structure of the world's ocean.  It will also provide
              a baseline for later evaluations of long-term change in the structure of the
              Southern Ocean.
