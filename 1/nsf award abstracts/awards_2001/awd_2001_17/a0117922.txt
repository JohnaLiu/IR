              ABSTRACT

OCE-0117922

In this project, researchers at the Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution will develop a technique independent of sediment
              traps for determining  particle flux throughout the oceanic water column. It is
              based on the known rate of production of 230Th  and 231Pa from decay of U
              isotopes dissolved in seawater and is similar in concept to the use of 234Th to
               determine export flux from the euphotic zone. Particles of various size ranges
              will be sampled by large- volume (1000-2000 liters), in-situ filtration and
              analyzed for the two radionuclides and for their major  components (organic
              matter, carbonate, opal, aluminosilicate). The whole water column will be
              sampled,  but a major emphasis will be on remineralization of organic matter in
              the mesopelagic zone (~150 - 1500m), where there is a large decrease of the
              flux with depth but where direct measurement of the flux  with sediment traps
              is difficult and subject to large errors. The Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT)
              Station  ALOHA is the site chosen  for this initial study because it is remote
              from the complicating effects of ocean  margins and because of the logistical
              ease and the supporting data provided by the ongoing time-series  program. The
              proposed method is made feasible by the recent development of high-sensitivity
              analytical  methods for measurement of 230Th and 231Pa in small samples by
              inductively-coupled plasma mass  spectrometry (ICP-MS). If the concept proves
              in this project to be successful, the method could be  applied to other oceanic
              areas and could be extended to a variety of specific elements and compounds.
