Abstract    :
              This project investigates social change in a small town in the same spirit that
              Chicago-school researchers investigated urban communities in the last century. 
              Although it shares the aims and methods of traditional community studies, it
              differs in two important ways.  First, while most ethnographies from this
              period investigate the impact of urbanization, bureaucratization, and
              industrialization on urban life, this ethnography concentrates on a small town.
               Second, while traditional community studies concentrate on cities where crime
              and poverty are serious problems, small towns must deal with different
              problems.  They face a declining agricultural economy, threats to locally-owned
              businesses from chain stores, and shrinking populations and resources.  This
              study therefore examines one town of four thousand people, Viroqua, Wisconsin,
              that has successfully responded to outside forces that have devastated other
              small towns.  In identifying the conditions that enabled the residents of
              Viroqua to overcome the town's problems, the project not only offers insights
              into the nature of community life, but also provides information on improving
              the quality of life of residents in small towns.
