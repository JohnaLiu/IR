              Summary:  This proposal requests support for a study to test a new hypothesis
              on the origin of intermittent transient glaciations of the early and middle
              Miocene (the Mi-events) and possibly the late Oligocene.  New findings suggest
              that the largest of the glaciations (Mi-1) at the Oligocene/Miocene boundary
              coincided with a rare congruence of an extended low-amplitude orbital obliquity
              node with a period of low orbital eccentricity.  The study focus on developing
              isotope records that will test the prediction that similar climate anomalies
              occur at 18.2 and 27 Ma when orbital calculations indicate extended
              low-amplitude obliquity nodes also correspond with intervals of low
              eccentricity.
