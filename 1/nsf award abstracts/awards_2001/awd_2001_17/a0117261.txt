Abstract    :
              
The American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) is an organization
              based in 
Alexandria, Virginia, which has as its members 32 Tribally
              Controlled Colleges and 
Universities (TCUs) from throughout the United
              States. AIHEC has a history of 
administering programs and providing technical
              assistance on a variety of matters.

A Board of Directors composed of the
              presidents of all member colleges governs AIHEC.
A full-time staff is located
              at the AIHEC Central Office in Alexandria, Virginia.

AIHEC has a long-term
              commitment to improving technology and the use of technology at
TCUs. 

This
              application is for a special project award to provide technical assistance to
              TCUs, 
Alaska Native and Native-Hawaiian-serving institutions to be funded
              under NSF's Tribal 
Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP).

Under the
              two-year TCUP technical assistance proposal described below, AIHEC proposes
              
to assist eligible applicants in developing high-quality proposals to the
              TCUP Program 
through a two-day workshop and a web-based technology
              collaborative and to provide
 on-going technical support to ensure achievement
              of TCUP goals and objectives.
