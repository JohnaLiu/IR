Abstract    :
              This ocean sciences technology development project will develop and construct
              three new broadband autonomous seismic instruments to be used for 1) compliance
              measurements on the seafloor, 2) the development and testing of new sensors for
              broadband seismology and other geophysical applications and 3) studies of the
              variations in ocean floor seismic noise in preparation for the installation of
              permanent seafloor seismic observatories.  The instruments will be based on
              STS-2 three component seismometers. The primary work required involves fitting
              the sensors into motor driven gimbals within the glass pressure housings after
              installing a clamp/unclamp system onto the sensors. Broadband seismometers such
              as the STS-2 are very fragile and must be clamped when not on the seafloor. The
              compliance technique can map regions of melt within the oceanic crust and is
              therefore a valuable scientific tool for understanding the formation of the
              oceanic crust. Better instruments are required to continue the development of
              this technique and to extend the use of this technique to new geophysical
              features such as hydrates and hydrothermal areas.  Once developed and
              constructed, the instruments will be placed is a pool of shared-use equipment
              accessible by the whole research community.
