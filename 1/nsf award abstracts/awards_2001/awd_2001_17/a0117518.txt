Abstract    :
              The objectives of this multi-campus research Center are 1) to explore, conduct
              research and to bring about innovation and practical solutions by focusing on
              the industrially relevant research needs; 2) to foster collaborative research
              projects between industrial and academic engineers and scientists; and 3) to
              promote interdisciplinary and intra-university research activities and to
              nurture students through testbed and collaborative projects.

The Center
              proposed four key program areas, namely 1) production equipment e-monitoring
              and e-maintenance systems; 2) web-enabled industrial systems management and
              optimization program; 3) smart business to devices technologies program; and 4)
              web-enabled development tools for e-maintenance application systems
