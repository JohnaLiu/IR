Abstract    :
              This award will enable researchers to develop high-resolution (~10 year
              interval) microfossil and geochemical records from sediment cores recently
              collected from the northern coastal waters of Lake Victoria in East Africa. 
              Preliminary evidence indicates that the cores contain evidence of past lake
              level fluctuations due to climatic changes over the last millennium. 

From
              these sedimentary records, researchers hope to reconstruct the environmental
              history of Lake Victoria over the last 500 years, reconstruct an unprecedented
              high-resolution paleoclimatological record of East African droughts, gain
              insights into the role of century- to decade-scale climate cycles in the
              tropics, investigate how solar variability over time affects African climates,
              and examine the timing and nature of tropical climate responses to the Medieval
              Warm Period and Little Ice Age. 

As an RUI proposal, this award will provide
              a unique opportunity for undergraduate students to participate in high-quality
              research thereby gaining invaluable experience in practical aspects of
              scientific research.
