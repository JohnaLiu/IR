This award supports a planning visit to South Africa by
              Professor Giacomo Bernardi, Department of Biology, University of California,
              Santa Cruz in June 2001.  Professor Bernardi will work with Professor Paulette
              Bloomer, Department of Genetics, University of Pretoria to evaluate the
              possibility of doing a study on fish species whose populations are found across
              the Cape of Good Hope region.  They will determine whether matching
              biogeographic and phylogeographic breaks would be found there.  

The
              mechanisms involved in the formation of species (speciation) in the marine
              environment are poorly known.  Several models have been proposed to explain the
              processes of marine speciation.  One well-studied system, in the southeastern
              United States, emphasized the role of genetic partitioning of populations
              across a defined geographic region (phylogeographic break).  This
              phylogeographic break also matched a region of species discontinuity
              (biogeographic boundary).  This system is now well documented, but so far has
              not been generalized to other systems.  During the planning visit to South
              Africa, Bernardi and Bloomer will try to collect fishes whose populations are
              found on both Atlantic and Indian Ocean sides of the Cape Region and that are
              endemic to Southern Africa.  If successful, they will formulate proposals for
              cooperative research proposals to US and South African funding agencies.
