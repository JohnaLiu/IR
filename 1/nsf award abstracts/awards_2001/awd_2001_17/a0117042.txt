Abstract    :
              0117042  Cutright  The objective of this research is to provide the fundamentals
              needed for the construction of multi-enzyme systems that will affect
              degradation of organic waste streams containing mixed pollutants such as
              trichloroethylene, toluene, dichloroethylene and chlorophenols.  The specific
              objectives of this research include: (1) development of the microbial
              consortium for isolating the multi-enzymatic catalytic system for the treatment
              of polluted wastewater, and (2) demonstrating the feasibility of immobilized
              multi-enzyme systems for degrading chlorinated solvents.  This research will
              also contribute to understanding the interactions among enzymes and cofactors
              involved in the biodegradation pathways. ***
