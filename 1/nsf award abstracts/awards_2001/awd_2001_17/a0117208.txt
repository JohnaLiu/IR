              ABSTRACT

OCE-0117208

In this study, researchers at the State University of
              New York at Stony Brook will attempt to identify and describe the various
              processes that lead to the enrichment  of dissolved organic matter in the
              sea-surface microlayer. The sea-surface microlayer  plays a major role in the
              exchange of matter and energy in the ocean-atmosphere system.  Organic matter
              enriches the surface microlayer and influences its chemical, biological, and 
              physical characteristics.  Different constituents concentrate in the 
              microlayer non-uniformly; consequently, the ratios of many dissolved elements
              and organic  compounds therein differ from those in bulk water.   These studies
              will focus on the transfer of dissolved free and combined amino acids  between
              particulate and dissolved pools under the unique conditions of the interfacial 
              laminar layer.  A number of factors will be considered: increased physical
              stress on the biological  community at the sea surface (e.g., by UV-radiation,
              evaporation, entrapment in spray),  which causes leaching of organic matter
              from the resulting dead or injured organisms;  dissolved organic matter
              decomposition by metabolically active neuston (hydrolysis, oxidation, and
              uptake); adsorption of dissolved matter onto particles which in the microlayer;
              and bubble scavenging from bulk water to the  surface microlayer of
              proteinaceous matter that is dissolved or weakly associated with  particles.
