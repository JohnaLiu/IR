Abstract    :
              Although social scientists have often studied fear of crime, they know little
              about the underlying character and dynamics of that fear, and how it affects
              the social life of urban communities.  This project therefore examines how
              actors socially construct fear of crime as a means of understanding places,
              events, relationships, and groups in society.  In turn, it examines how people
              experience crime and cope with its risks.  The data on these topics come from
              direct observation of and face-to-face interviews with residents of two
              neighborhoods (the Lower East Side and Flatbush/Midwood areas of New York
              City).  The detailed case study of these two areas and their inhabitants not
              only offers information on the sources of fear of crime, but also has
              implications for the vitality, safety, and future of urban neighborhoods.
