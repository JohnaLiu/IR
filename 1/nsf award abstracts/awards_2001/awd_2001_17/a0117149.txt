Abstract    :
              Science Summary:  This proposal requests support for a detailed (millennial to
              centennial scale) multiproxy study of the surface and deep water dynamics along
              the continental margin in the NE Atlantic.  Work will focus in the area
              involving interaction between the Labrador Current and the Gulf Stream. 
              Multiproxy study of high accumulation rate cores  from the Continental Shelf,
              Slope, and Laurentian Fan will allow identification of salinity and temperature
              changes and source of deep waters.  The study will focus on rapid changes
              associated with the Little Ice Age, Medieval Warm Period, the 8.2 ka cold
              event, and the Younger Dryas.
