Abstract    :
              The 2001 meeting of the "Eukaryotic DNA Replication" biennial conference  will
              be held September 5 - 9, 2001, at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.  The
              meeting will be devoted to fundamental research topics related to chromosome
              duplication and structure and function, and will include important topics of
              biological research in the areas of cell cycle and growth control, DNA
              replication, replication-associated gene regulation, and genome amplification.
              The need for this meeting is evidenced by the rapid advances made in this field
              over recent years. The meeting will ensure that recent results will be
              communicated and discussed in an atmosphere conducive to the open, lively, and
              productive exchange of ideas. The participation of younger investigators and
              women scientists will be encouraged.  The areas to be covered by the 2001
              meeting will include studies on the following: 

(1)  The replication of
              virus chromosomes, including SV40, polyomavirus, cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus,
              papillomaviruses, and  Epstein-Barr virus
(2)  Chromosomal replication and
              gene amplification in organisms as diverse as yeast, Drosophila, Xenopus and
              mammalian cells
(3)  Control of DNA replication in the cell cycle 
(4) 
              Structure and function of chromosomal elements such as origins of replication
              and telomeres
(5)  Control of cell cycle progression and S phase specific gene
              expression 
(6)  DNA replication checkpoints and DNA repair. 

DNA
              replication is an essential process in all organisms.  This meeting will help
              disseminate current research findings on this vital topic and will stimulate
              and facilitate further advances. The financial support provided by the National
              Science Foundation will enable students, postdoctoral fellows, and young
              investigators to attend this important meeting.
