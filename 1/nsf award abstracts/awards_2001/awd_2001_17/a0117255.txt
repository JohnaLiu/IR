Research
              Experiences in High-Performance Computing and Communications

In this
              project, our goals are to (1) strengthen our ability to attract and retain
              undergraduate and graduate minority students, (2) increase the numbers of
              talented undergraduate minority students pursuing graduate education and
              high-tech industrial careers,  (3) enhance the research productivity of the
              faculty and students, and (4) provide valuable industry experience to these
              students through industrial internships.

We propose to create a dual-mentor
              partnership program with local industry to enhance the linkage of research and
              high-tech opportunities for our students.  Students selected for this program
              will participate as NSF student scholars and will be provided financial support
              in the form of scholarships and research assistantships. Students will be
              expected to collaborate with a faculty mentor and regional industry research
              partners.

Faculty from the Computer Science Department and the College of
              Engineering, will provide undergraduate student mentoring, work to develop
              student skills in problem solving activities, and create student research
              collaborations with faculty and industry. The research strengths in CS alone
              include: 1) parallel and distributed computing; 2) compiler technology for
              internet and parallel computing; 3) computer network protocols; 4) network
              security; 5) high-speed switching architectures; 6) data mining; and 7)
              biocomputing.
