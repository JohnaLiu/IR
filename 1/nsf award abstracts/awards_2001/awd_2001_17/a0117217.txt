Abstract    :
              Episodes of violence in schools have heightened public concern with school
              safety.  They have also generated scholarly concern with the causes of such
              violence.  Two theories of general aggression among adolescents may help
              explain acts of violence in schools.  One theory emphasizes the importance for
              violence prevention of the social bonds individual youth have with their
              families, schools, and religious organizations.  Another theory emphasizes the
              importance of social control within the school environment for individual acts
              of violence.  Using data on a sample of seventh-grade students from schools in
              a representative sample of counties in Kentucky, this project addresses four
              questions concerning the causes of school violence?  One, what are the effects
              of the bonding of individuals to families, schools, peers, and religion?  Two,
              do the effects of bonding vary across schools?  Three, what are the effects of
              school-level variables such as racial composition, student mobility, and
              financial resources?  And four, does the organization of schools in terms of
              teacher supervision and intervention affect the influence of the school-level
              variables?  The results not only contribute to the understanding of the causes
              of violence, but also help identify effective means to prevent school violence.
