Abstract    :
              This dissertation examines how a nation's defense posture influences its efforts
              and successes at achieving social policy objects.  The maintenance of large
              standing armed forces amounts to a significant state intervention in labor
              market outcomes, influences the need for and commitments to public social
              programs, and confers the politically-salient status of "citizen" on large
              segments of the population.  Despite such connections between military
              personnel policies and public policy, however, the military component of the
              welfare state has received little scholarly attention.  The project addresses
              this gap by examining how the size of the military and the level of defense
              spending affect public spending for social security and family benefits.  The
              data come from two sources:  published figures from19 advanced industrial
              nations over the period of 1960-1994, and from national and state-level data
              for the United States over the period of 1945-1995.
