Abstract    :
              This grant supports a workshop on Environmentally Benign Manufacturing (EBM) and
              Remanufacturing in the Transport Industries, to be held in Ypsilanti, Michigan,
              October 4-6, 2001.  Ford Motor Company and the Integrated Manufacturing
              Technology Initiative (IMTI) are also supporting the workshop.  The objective
              of the workshop is to invite participants from industry and academia to discuss
              future directions and opportunities for research collaboration in EBM that will
              serve as a roadmap for the development of future research projects.  While
              research in the fields of Design for the Environment (DfE) and Life Cycle
              Analysis (LCA) have focused on the product, there is a need to focus on
              processes and their impact both on the manufacturing aspects and on the product
              life cycle.  

This workshop will explore the EBM issues to establish the
              fundamental research needs to address current and future manufacturing
              enterprise.
