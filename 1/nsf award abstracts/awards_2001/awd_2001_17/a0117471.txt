Abstract    :
              Especially at this time of rapidly changing institutions, the normative claims
              of professions raise interesting and important questions to explore.  In 1993,
              the world's two largest associations of those who design, develop, test, and
              maintain software (the IEEE Computer Society and the Association of Computing
              Machinery) formed a joint committee to organize "software engineering" as a
              profession. A product of that effort is a "Code of Ethics and Professional
              Practice" adopted by both IEEE-CS and ACM late in 1998. The writing of the
              code, carried out in substantial part by e-mail, has produced a record of the
              writing of a professional code that is far fuller than that of any other,
              though much of that record is now in danger of being lost. Using interviews as
              well as retrieving electronic information, the project will create a publicly
              acccessible electronic archive of all e-mail, memos, and interviews it can
              obtain relating to the writing of the code. That record, together with
              additional materials, including the interviews with participants, will form the
              basis for a a book length study of the drafting, debate, and ultimate adoption
              of the code. This research can help to engender a more sophisticated conception
              of profession with respect to normative and ethical issues.  The project
              involves a team of researchers including several graduate students at two
              institutions, the Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions (CSEP), of
              Illinois Institute of Technology, with the Software Engineering Ethics Research
              Institute (SEERI), of East Tennessee State University. An advisory board
              provides additional expertise to the project.
