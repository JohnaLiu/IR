Abstract    :
              In industrial America, work careers were structured, organized, and defined by
              traditional employment relationships and the normal age-based transitions into
              and out of work. Because work in the post-industrial era involves more
              flexibility in both employment relationships and life course patterns, it is
              possible for new career patterns to emerge.   This project examines how recent
              college graduates choose among diverse possibilities for organizing and giving
              meaning to their work lives.  To do so, it first uses existing longitudinal
              cohort data on career plans and aspirations for a sample of recent college
              graduates.  It supplements these data with in-depth, semi-structured life
              history interviews that help categorize diverse career strategies and
              experiences, and help reveal the forces behind the diverse strategies and
              experiences.  The results contribute to the development of a theory of how
              highly educated adults construct their work careers in a contemporary context.
