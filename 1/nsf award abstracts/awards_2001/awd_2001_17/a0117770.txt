Abstract    :
              This award establishes a Nanoscience and Engineering Center (NSEC) for Nanoscale
              Systems in Information Technologies (CNS) at Cornell University.  The Center
              will aim to make major advances in the ultra-high performance processing,
              sensing, storage, and transmission of information.  The Center will undertake
              three major nanoscale science and Engineering initiatives to develop and
              expolit the electronic, photonic, and magnetic properties of devices and
              materials at nanoscale.  The largest thrust will be in nanoelectronics where
              new, practical architecture will be developed within which the physics of
              charge confinement and electrostatic energy in nanostructures will provide
              unique benefits for dense information-processing systems and employ embedded
              memory elements as logic.  The Center will collaborate with industry for
              expertise, unique materials, specialized instrumentation, and critical pathways
              to speed results to application.  The collaboration will provide industrial
              experience to the Center's graduate students.  The education, human resources
              development, and outreach activities include:  (1) mentoring program to attract
              and retain a more diverse population of young researchers; (2)
              interdisciplinary curriculum, including a major laboratory component for
              graduate and undergraduate levels; and (3) outreach to secondary education to
              enhance the teaching and student appreciation of nanoscale science and
              engineering topics.
