Abstract    :
              This research will yield the first climatic and environmental records ever
              recovered from the center of the Tibetan Plateau by analyzing two ice cores
              measuring 118.6 and 214 meters that were recovered from the Puruogangri ice cap
              during a joint United States-China expedition between September 10 and November
              10, 2000 funded by the National Science Foundation. 

These unique ice cores
              join other archives of changes in climate on the Tibetan Plateau that document
              an unprecedented warming of the atmosphere in the 20th century. Preliminary
              analyses indicate that both cores contain visible dry-season dust layers and
              may allow annual dating back to ~80 BC and the reconstruction of a history of
              precipitation fluctuations that are likely to reflect variations in the
              intensity of the monsoon system that is affected by El Nino-Southern
              Oscillation (ENSO) events. These cores will be analyzed for stable isotopes of
              oxygen and deuterium and aerosol chemistry to aid in the reconstruction of the
              history of Asian aridity and provide a record of the past temperatures and
              atmospheric circulation patterns for the region.

The ice of the Puruogangri
              contains information that is an essential component in linking long,
              high-resolution records from pole to pole to allow an assessment of the global
              nature of abrupt climate variations. This is important because the Tibetan
              Plateau and surrounding mountain ranges contain the largest volume of ice
              outside the Polar Regions. The meltwater from the climatically sensitive
              glaciers form the headwaters of such important rivers as the Indus, Yangtze,
              Huang (Yellow) and the Ganges.
