This Americas Program award will support the participation of
              U.S. and Latin American students in the Fourth Latin American Symposium on
              Nuclear Physics (IV LASNP) that will take place in Mexico City, Mexico,
              September 24-28, 2001. The award will support a workshop organized by Dr.
              Phillip Cole of the University of Texas at El Paso, Dr. David Ernst of
              Vanderbilt University, and Dr. Efrain Chavez of the Instituto de Fisica at the
              Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.  This award is partially supported by
              the Physics Division of NSF.

The workshop will cover a wide range of timely
              and important issues in nuclear physics such as heavy ion reactions in the low
              to medium-energy range, exotic nuclei, as well as photo- and electron-nuclear
              physics.  The meeting seeks to promote dialog between faculty members of North
              American and Latin-American institutions by finding common interests in
              research and through this effort strengthen existing links and forge new ones
              within the broad scope of the international nuclear physics community. 
              Strengthening this link between the United States and Latin America will foster
              the recruitment of high-caliber graduate-level students to pursue research at
              U.S. institutions and laboratories.
