              ABSTRACT

OCE-0117183

The study will continue the measurement of inorganic
              carbonate parameters (dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC, and titration alkalinity
              TAlk) and include a restoration of pH and surface dissolved (pCO2) measurement
              components of the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT). The continuation of one of
              only a handful of long-term oceanic CO2 data sets would appear essential for
              assessing oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 and informing and interpreting
              the interannual variability in the oceanic global carbon cycle.
