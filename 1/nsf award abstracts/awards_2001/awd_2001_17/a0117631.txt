Abstract    :
              Sociological theories and studies of the welfare state did much to explain its
              unprecedented growth after World War II, but now face another challenge.  They
              need to account for the current period of crisis, retrenchment, and limits to
              growth as well as for previous periods of increasing state capacity.  This
              project addresses this challenge using the methods of comparative historical
              sociology.  Concentrating on the tax revolt in the U.S. during the 1970s that
              led to a series of dramatic legislative victories, it considers why the
              movement emerged when it did, what it did to gain initial policy success, and
              how it affected later political debates about taxes and welfare policy.  The
              methods used involve analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data. 
              First, the project compares the grassroots protests in the United States with
              those in Denmark, and compares both to the lack of such protests in Sweden and
              Britain.  Second, it compares the varied movement success in California, New
              York, and Massachusetts.  Third, it uses quantitative event history analyses to
              explore the adoption of anti-tax legislation in 27 of 50 states. The results
              show how the initial policy success of the tax revolt changed the direction of
              American politics and the effectiveness of later challenges to tax policy.
