              ABSTRACT

OCE-0117062

Two researcher from the State University of New
              York-Stony Brook will continue their research into the effects that
              bottom-dwelling animals have on the rates of diagenetic reactions,
              sediment-water solute exchange and storage of organic/mineral phases in
              sedimentary deposits.  To achieve these objectives, the PIs will focus their
              research along the following three, interrelated experimental efforts:  (1)
              irrigation, diffusion structure and optimal scaling of coupled oxic-anoxic
              reactions; (2) diffusive permeability of burrow linings and mucoid  secretions
              in sediments; and (3) multi-dimensional solute distributions in the bioturbated
              zone.  This team of scientists also plans to add CO2 and specific exoenzyme
              sensors to their radiometric pH/O2 sensor and use these planar sensor
              techniques for in-situ measurements on the REMOTS lander system.  The long term
              goals of this research will be a model that outlines the types of transport and
              reaction balances occurring during early diagenesis in the bioturbated zone and
              an exploration of the corresponding elemental cycling and ecological
              implications.
