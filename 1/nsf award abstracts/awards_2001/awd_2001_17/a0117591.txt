Abstract    :
              The Summer School for Chemical Engineering faculty is organized by the Chemical
              Engineering Division of the American Society for Engineering Education and is
              currently held every five years. The 2002 Summer School will be the thirteenth
              in the series begun in 1931 and will be held on the campus of the University of
              Colorado in Boulder from July 27 through August 2. This Summer School is unique
              amongst the various engineering disciplines as it strives to promote
              development of primarily new faculty with the assistance of established
              faculty, representatives from governmental agencies such as NSF and EPA, and
              industrial participants.

The main purpose of the Summer School for Chemical
              Engineering Faculty is to disseminate innovative and effective teaching methods
              to a wide spectrum of primarily new chemical engineering faculty who will be
              teaching courses and laboratories in undergraduate programs. Additionally, the
              Summer School will introduce new faculty to a number of promising research
              areas from which concepts, principles, problems, and laboratory experiments can
              be incorporated into undergraduate course work. The Summer School also brings
              new faculty together with mid- career and senior faculty to discuss educational
              methods and educational delivery and to provide tested educational materials
              directly to new faculty for use in a variety of courses. Workshops are planned
              in many areas that receive NSF and EPA research support, including molecular
              modeling, nanoparticle technology, bioengineering, green chemical engineering,
              and effective use of computers and educational technology.  The educational
              techniques and extensive course and laboratory materials produced will be
              distributed widely via CD-ROMs and the Internet to the entire chemical
              engineering educational community. It is the objective of the upcoming Summer
              School to have an impact on every single B.S. graduate in chemical engineering
              as early as the spring of 2003, as well as all those graduates who will
              follow.
