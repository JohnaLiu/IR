Discovery Science

This is a standard award to provide funding for 2 plenary speakers
              and up to 10 graduate students attending the fourth conference on Discovery
              Science to be held in Washington DC in November 2001.  The goal of the new
              field of Discovery Science is to automate (as much as possible) the process by
              which scientific insights are distilled from large data sets.  The intellectual
              scope of the field is very broad, covering topics from philosophy, logic,
              automated reasoning and computational learning theory, as well as empirical
              investigations of various implemented discovery algorithms. An important
              contribution of the conferences is that they assemble a wide range of
              perspectives on the process of discovery in the hopes of generating synergy.
              This year's conference will be the first to be held in this country, and the PI
              is the local organizer of the meeting.   Student participants will be selected
              by the Steering Committee from among the student authors, based primarily on
              the rankings of the papers by the Program Committee but moderated slightly by a
              desire to achieve diversity.  The two invited speakers will be senior
              researchers from related fields, chosen by the Steering Committee with a view
              to building bridges to related research communities.
