This project focuses on observing and understanding
              ocean-climate related processes in the North pacific subtropical gyre by
              conducting two additional year of hydrographic sampling at the Hawaiian Ocean
              Time-Series (HOT) to extend the record to 15 years. This work also support the
              biogeochemistry research component of HOT. The analysis of the time series will
              seek to improve our description of ocean climate variability by combining
              observation from HOT with numerical models to understand the causes of this
              variability. In particular, the subduction process at the subtropical front
              will be studied in relation to water mass variability observed at the HOT site,
              including surface layer variations due to air-sea interactions. This project
              will also contribute to the Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR)
              Program.
