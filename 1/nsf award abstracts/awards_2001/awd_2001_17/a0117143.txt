Abstract    :
              In response to changes in public services in recent years, faith-based community
              development organizations have increasingly provided social services such as
              job training, low-income housing, and small business loans.  Although rarely
              studied, these organizations take the form of cooperative collective action or
              social movements.  This projects draws from organizational and collective
              action theories to understand the emergence and outcomes of faith-based
              community development.  In so doing, it evaluates hypotheses concerning the
              growth of bureaucratic structures in these organizations as they grow older and
              larger, and the growing similarity of organizations in their "action frames." 
              Field work in three faith-based community development organizations, including
              interviews with organizational leaders, examination of organizational
              documents, and observations of meetings and activities, provides the data to
              evaluate the theories and hypotheses.  The results help understand an
              increasingly important social movement that the literature has largely ignored.
