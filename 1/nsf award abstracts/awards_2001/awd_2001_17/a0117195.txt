Science Summary:  This proposal requests
              support to complete a high-resolution record of deepwater characteristics
              (Cd/Ca) for all of the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 stadial/interstadial (S/IS)
              events and for all of MIS 5 in piston cores from the Bermuda Rise.  The Cd/Ca
              data will be used to determine if changes in  North Atlantic deep water flow
              are associated with S/IS events and if so, determine the phase relationships
              between the S/SI events and changes in deep water circulation.  Records
              suitable for investigating the links between thermohaline circulation and S/SI
              events  can be developed in cores from the Bermuda Rise because the
              accumulation rates are rapid enough (30cm/1000yrs) to resolve individual I/IS
              events and benthic foraminifers are abundant enough to allow continuous
              measurements of Cd/Ca through the S/IS events.
