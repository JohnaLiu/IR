Abstract    :
              Science Summary:  This proposal requests support to test the hypothesis that the
              millennial changes in Oxygen Mimimum Zone intensity in the Arabian Sea are
              directly related to changes in the intensity of upwelling-favorable winds
              associated with the SW Indian Ocean monsoon.  Past changes in monsoon-driven
              productivity will be traced by measuring a proxy (231Pa/230Th ratio) that is
              insensitive to sediment focusing and to changes in bottom water oxygen content.
               The study will be performed on sediment cores from  the Pakistan margin.
