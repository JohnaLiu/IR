              Abstract

The goals of this proposed study are to better understand the
              behavior of platinum group elements (PGEs) during dehydration of the downgoing
              slab and flux melting of the mantle wedge above it. What are the
              parent-daughter fractionations that occur and how do these contribute to
              creation of mantle heterogeneities. Since the Tonga-Lau basin system is
              intraoceanic, the complications due to continental crust can be avoided.
              Analyses of Re, PGEs and Os isotopes plus 0 and S isotopes will be done for
              existing ODP samples from the Tonga system and old Pacific crust that have been
              characterized for other trace elements and isotope systems. Having a
              well-characterized suite of representative samples should allow an assessment
              of the relative contributions of subducted sediments, altered ocean crust, and
              the mantle wedge in arc and back arc volcanic rocks.
