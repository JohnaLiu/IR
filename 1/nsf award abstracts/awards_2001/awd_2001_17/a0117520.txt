Abstract    :
              The 12th International Conference on Arabidopsis Research will be held at
the
              University of Wisconsin, Madison WI, June 23 - 27, 2001. The aim of
              this
conference is to provide an opportunity for the exchange of ideas
              among
researchers of the international Arabidopsis research community. 
              The
conference will include sessions on genomics, metabolism and
              metabolic
regulation, cell biology, inductive processes, genetic
              mechanisms,
evolution, responses to the biotic environment, responses to the
              abiotic
environment, pattern formation and cell fate, and sex and
              reproductive
development.  An important component of the conference is that
              approximately
40 speakers will be chosen by the session chairs from submitted
              abstracts
for short talks.  The majority of these talks will be given by
              graduate
students, postdoctoral researchers, or PIs at early stages of their
              careers.
 This will ensure presentation of the latest results and provide
              important
career development for the selected speakers.  The conference will
              also
include workshops on topics put forward by the Arabidopsis community. 
              A
workshop to foster international collaboration on Arabidopsis
              functional
genomics and the NSF-supported Arabidopsis 2010 initiative is
              already
planned.  Last year's Arabidopsis Conference at this same site
              attracted
approximately 900 participants.  At least this many participants
              are
expected this year due to the accelerated pace of Arabidopsis
              research
resulting in part from the completion of the genome sequence for
              this
organism, and due to the small number of plant-related conferences
              scheduled
for summer 2001.  Facilities are available to accommodate up to
              1000
participants.
