Abstract    :
              The investigators will organize a workshop to review the current state of
              theoretical and numerical modeling and high resolution observations of several
              important processes in the solar atmosphere, and to develop recommendations for
              future observations. The workshop will focus on physics of small-scale
              processes including those that take place before and during initiation of the
              coronal mass ejections, which are crucial for understanding CME phenomena and
              space weather. The last few years have seen exciting development of numerical
              simulations and theory of small-scale solar processes. However, these numerical
              simulations and theory alone cannot solve the puzzling aspects of many solar
              phenomena - high-resolution observations are crucial. On the other hand,
              observers need "clues" from theorists and modelers on what they shall try to
              observe. This workshop will foster a discussion between theorists and modelers
              on one side and observers on the other and will help to refine the requirements
              for the Advanced Technology  Solar Telescope (ATST). Sacramento Peak Summer
              Workshops are topical meetings sponsored by the National Solar Observatory and
              have a tradition of bringing together an international group of observers and
              theoreticians for productive interactions that are not normally available
              through the format of larger meetings. The intimate setting of the observatory
              in the Lincoln National Forest, combined with the proximity to telescopes and
              observing hardware provides a unique environment for these events. Travel
              grants will be made on a competitive and need basis.
