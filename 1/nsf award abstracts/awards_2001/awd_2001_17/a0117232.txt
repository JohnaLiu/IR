Description:  This project supports a US-Jordan Workshop
              on Modern Power Electronics to be held in Amman, Jordan in May 2002.  The
              co-organizers are Dr. Issa Batarseh, School of Electrical Engineering and
              Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, and Dr. Sadeq Hamaed,
              Faculty of Engineering, University of Jordan, Amman.  The workshop will include
              sessions on power electronics curriculum development, hardware and software
              laboratory support, possibilities for joint research collaboration projects,
              and academic-industry relations in both countries.  It is expected that at
              least 25 US and Jordanian scientists from academic institutions will
              participate.  Representatives from Jordanian industries will be invited.  A
              publication of the proceedings is planned. 

Scope:  This project enables
              eight US scientists to attend this workshop to discuss with Jordanian
              scientists the changes taking place in the engineering curriculum for training
              power electronics engineers in the two countries.  With its focus on
              discussions of detailed course offerings, at both undergraduate and graduate
              levels, the workshop will explore the current industry needs for power
              electronics engineers.
