Abstract    :
              Science Summary:  This proposal requests support for a multiproxy study to test
              the theory that atmospheric cooling beginning about 2000 years ago lead to
              increased production of North Atlantic Deep Water in the western North Atlantic
              primarily through an  increase in Denmark Strait Overflow water. The sequence
              of events in the last 2000 years is very similar to events observed at the end
              of the last interglacial (MIS 5e) and suggests that the increase of deep water
              production in the western North Atlantic marks the beginning of the end of the
              current interglacial.  This study will include detailed analysis of samples
              from cores in separate transects to determine sea surface temperature and rates
              of Holocene and MIS 5e deep water production across the North Atlantic. 
              Proxies to be studied include faunal counts, stable isotope measurements of N.
              pachyderma (left and right coiling), IRD and IRD petrology.  In addition trace
              element analyses (Cd/Ca, Zn/Ca, and Mg/Ca) will assist and check
              interpretations based on faunal and stable isotope data.
