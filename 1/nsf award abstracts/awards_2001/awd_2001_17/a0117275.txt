Abstract    :
              This project assesses the impact of gender mistakes on inequality.  A gender
              mistake occurs when an actor learns that he or she has incorrectly sex
              categorized another.  These gender mistakes may have lingering effects on the
              behaviors and attitudes of the actor who made the mistake, even after they are
              corrected.  For example, when a man is mistaken for a women, he will enjoy less
              of a gender advantage in that interaction, even after the mistake is corrected,
              than he would if the mistake had never occurred.  A women who is mistaken for a
              man, on the other hand, will suffer less of a gender disadvantage than she
              would have if the mistake had not happened.  The project tests these claims
              using an experimental design common in expectations states research.  The
              results suggest that if gender mistakes occur in many interactions, involving
              many actors, they might contribute to reducing gender inequality and the male
              advantage in interaction.  They also suggest that gender equality is maintained
              by clear-cut displays of gender behavior in certain social situations and
              distinct categorization of the sexes.
