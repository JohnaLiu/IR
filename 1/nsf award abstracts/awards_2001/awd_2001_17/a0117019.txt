Abstract    :
              This research will examine a suite of cores from Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana, for
              evidence of a high-resolution (i.e., interannual to millennial-scale) record of
              West African Monsoon dynamics over the last 20,000 years.

Lake Bosumtwi is
              the remnant of a basin formed by a meteor impact approximately 1.1 million
              years ago.  As such, the lake is a well-defined catchment basin that is
              sensitive to small changes in precipitation-evaporation balance, a fundamental
              aspect of climate.

The research strategy is to use a multi-proxy approach to
              analyze cores recovered from the lake under previous NSF funding. 
              Specifically, the researchers will develop annual resolution records of West
              African climate through the last 1,000 years, examine the record of West
              African monsoon variability through the last 20,000 years when climatic forcing
              functions were different than today, and establish detailed chronologies for
              sediments from the lake to examine abrupt climate change events in the region.
