This US-Brazil award will support a planning visit by Dr.
              Loftin of Old Dominion University to travel to Concepcion, Chile, in order to
              plan a collaborative research project with Arquitecto Emillo Armstrong Delpin. 
              The topic of this research is the development of a prototype
              computing/interactive display system for a Virtual Interactive Science Museum. 
              The system would be made available to students via the Education 2000 Internet
              Enlaces project of the Ministry of Education in Chile.

Studying the
              development and impact of the museum on Chilean children in public schools
              should offer insights on culturally and linguistically relevant pedagogies for
              informal education.  Other likely benefits are the diffusion of results for use
              in U.S. public schools and museums, culturally and linguistically relevant
              pedagogies for U.S. Latino populations, drivers for research in the computer
              and information sciences and engineering, and advances in learning science and
              technologies.  One compelling indirect benefit of the collaboration is the
              development of new strategies for international collaboration regarding the
              intersection of technology - and education-related topics.
