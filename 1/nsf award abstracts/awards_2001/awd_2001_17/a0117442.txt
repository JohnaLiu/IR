Abstract    :
              This research will establish the long-term trends, variations, and extremes of
              regional climate by examining variations in annual growth rings of old-aged
              trees in Mongolia and China dating back to 800 A.D.  Mongolia and the
              surrounding region are the center of the Asian High, the most extreme
              atmospheric pressure center of the Northern Hemisphere and a strong influence
              on winter atmospheric circulation.  The goal of the research is to understand
              climate trends that impact global weather patterns.  The effects of changing
              climate may be severe on Mongolia and changes in the Asian High can have
              effects far beyond the immediate region.

The tree-ring samples, obtained
              nondestructively, will be used to develop calendar-dated, annual to
              millennial-length records of climate variations.  Long records are essential
              because recorded information (approximately 50 years) does not reveal the full
              range of variability and trends in climate.

Sampling sites are high in
              mountains or at the edge of dry grasslands where the trees are stressed by
              climate.  Such tree-rings record the effects of warm and cold years in the
              mountains and wet and dry years near the grasslands.  The resulting records
              will yield valuable information about temperature trends, severe winters,
              droughts, floods, and other climatic variations.

The project is conducted in
              cooperation with Mongolian Universities, institutions, and government agencies.
               A Tree-Ring Laboratory has been organized at the National University and
              seminars and workshops are planned to teach and train students and scientists
              for cooperative and independent research.
