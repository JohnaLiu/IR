Abstract    :
               Talley/0117271

This project is an experiment conducted as a rapid response
              to the 
anomalously cold winter conditions over eastern Siberia.  
              Mid-winter
conditions appear to be comparable to those seen in 1976.  The
              goals 
are to discover the depth to which deep convection penetrates under
              
such conditions in the Sea of Japan, the size of a typical convective
              
patch, and the properties of the dense water formed.   The experiment
              
consists of a short cruise into a part of the Sea of Japan south of
              
Vladivostok.  The choice of location is based on survey work conducted 
last
              winter as part of a large ONR-sponsored experiment in the Japan 
Sea, recent
              AVHRR imagery, and recent data from a PALACE float in the 
Sea of Japan.  
              Deep CTD and bottle casts will be made at approximately 
34 stations south of
              Peter the Great Bay.  The endeavor is a 
collaboration between U.S. and
              Russian oceanographers.
