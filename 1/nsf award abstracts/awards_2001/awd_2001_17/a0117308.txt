Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to develop new algorithms and systems for
              effectively discovering knowledge in unstructured textual data. The approach
              first uses trained information extraction systems to obtain structured data
              from unstructured natural-language documents or web pages, and then applies
              rule induction methods to discover interesting patterns in this extracted data.
              Since data automatically extracted from text is noisy, heterogeneous, and
              non-standardized, the project studies two approaches to effectively mining
              extracted data. First, methods are developed for inducing rules that only
              partially match extracted text. Second, methods are developed that
              automatically cluster noisy variations of strings into standardized data items
              prior to mining. Algorithms are also developed for using discovered knowledge
              to further improve the accuracy of information extraction. Developed methods
              are being evaluated on large text corpora in business, medicine, science, and
              technology. The research will contribute to the development of technology
              capable of automatically discovering significant scientific, commercial, and
              industrial knowledge from the ever-growing supply of textual electronic
              information.
