              Summary:  This proposal requests continued funding for ongoing time series
              sediment trap studies  in the Santa Barbara Basin to calibrate climate proxies.
               The continuation of the sediment trap effort will establish a time series that
              is sufficiently long to document how well faunal and isotopic changes in
              planktonic foraminifers record interannual climate variability associated with
              ENSO.
