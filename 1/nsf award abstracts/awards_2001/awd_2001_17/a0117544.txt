Abstract    :
              This project examines how social identities and network ties in Ghana affect the
              success of small-scale entrepreneurs.  Ghana has an uncertain economy where
              warranties on manufactured products are not common.  In order to sell products,
              manufacturers must earn trust from customers and convince them that their
              products are good quality and that they will take good care of them when the
              products have problems.  Like other African countries, however, Ghana is an
              ethnically divided society, and it is often difficult to develop trust
              relationships across ethnic groups.  If such relationships were confined within
              one's own ethnic group, the market would be severely limited.  However, pilot
              study results conducted by the investigator in Ghana indicate that some
              manufacturers have more customers from varied ethnic groups and more total
              sales than others.  One possible explanation is that successful ones rely on
              broad identities based on religion rather that on narrower identities based on
              ethnicity.  Building on data and analyses of the pilot study, the project
              collects and analyzes additional data on ethnic and religious identities in
              Ghana, and their influence on entrepreneurial success.
