Abstract    :
              
This research program aims at understanding the structure,function and
              organization of the Photosystem I reaction center in cyanobacteria and green
              plants.The advances made so far include a biological method to introduce
              alternative quinones into the A1
site,an experimental approach to determine
              whether electron transfer is uni-or bi-directional among the
              symmetrically-located electron transfer cofactors,and a determination of the
              3-dimensional NMR solution structure of unbound PsaC.This,combined with
              newly-available structural information about the 3-dimensional spatial
              arrangement of atoms from X-ray crystallography and the electron spin density
              distribution in cofactors from magnetic resonance spectroscopy,has opened new
              avenues for research in PS I.  One is the effect of biological incorporation of
              alternative quinones into the A1 site for studies of the effect of Gibbs free
              energy changes on rates of forward and backward electron transfer, and for
              studies of the electron density distribution within the A1 - acceptor.  Another
              is the protein-protein interactions at the molecular level between the
              PsaA,PsaB, PsaC,and PsaD subunits,and focuses especially on the changes in
              secondary structure that take place when PsaC docks with its protein partners
              in PS I.The goal is to determine the dynamic interactions that occur among
              these to produce a functional PS I complex.

These studies promise to have an
              impact on the understanding of protein factors responsible for conferring redox
              properties to organic cofactors and on the understanding of protein-protein
              interactions in the assembly of multi-component,membrane-bound
              complexes.Hence,this work should have relevance well beyond the realm of
              oxygenic photosynthesis
