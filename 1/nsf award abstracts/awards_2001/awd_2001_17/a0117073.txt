Abstract    :
              Abstract: The intent of this proposal is to study and exploit to advantage some
              of the properties arising from confinement of electron motion to less than
              three dimensions. The study of confined electron behavior has had tremendous
              technological impact on all semiconductor devices including transistors, light
              emitters, and sensors. Our particular focus is on the design, study,
              fabrication, characterization, and testing of novel optical detectors that use
              altered regime of conduction due to reduced dimensionality to simultaneously
              achieve: a) low dark current due to the effect of the electron cloud, b) high
              responsivity due to the aiding electric field that confines the electron cloud,
              c) high speed due to reduction of absorption depth and inclusion of a Bragg
              reflector that forms a resonant cavity structure, and d) wavelength-filtering
              capability due to Bragg condition. A comprehensive device modeling and
              simulation with particular stress on the study of transient behavior will be
              performed. Next generation devices based on different material systems will be
              constructed and the study of contacts between 3D and 2D will be extended to the
              case of metallic contacts to 1D wires. In short, we propose a fundamental study
              of confined electron effects that contributes to the development of a family of
              novel devices. These devices constitute all the required elements for making a
              complete high sensitivity optical sensor, be it a near infrared detector for
              biological imaging or a gigabit Ethernet receiver.
