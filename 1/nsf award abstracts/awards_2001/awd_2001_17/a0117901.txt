Abstract    :
              In the face of the climate change treaty being negotiated under the United
              Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, oil corporations have responded
              differently.  Some have expressed support for the climate change treaty, while
              most have challenged climate change science and lobbied against mandated carbon
              dioxide and other greenhouse gas emission reductions.  Understanding this split
              in business views on the climate debates offers insights into the importance of
              transnational organizations for international politics, and into the role of
              non-state actors in negotiating international treaties among governments. 
              Using qualitative data on four oil corporations, and quantitative data on the
              50 largest oil corporations, the project thus addresses four questions:  1)
              what climate strategies have the oil corporations pursued, 2) what factors have
              accounted for differences in strategies, 3) how have the oil corporations
              responded to advocacy efforts of environmentalists, and 4) how has the split in
              the oil industry affected the progress and outcomes of the climate change
              negotiations?
