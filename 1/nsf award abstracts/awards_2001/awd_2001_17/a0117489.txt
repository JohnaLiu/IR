Abstract    :
              The long-term objective of this project is to establish effective techniques for
              "fingertip haptics" - the direct fingertip exploration of virtual surfaces.
              This includes "direct" touch of objects as well as distal attribution (touching
              using an intermediate object such as a pencil or knife). In the course of the
              work,  two novel devices will be built and studied,  a tactile-haptic device
              with "contrary motion", and a novel "tangent plane" device, to help achieve the
              tangent position of the operator's finger relative the virtual surface.
