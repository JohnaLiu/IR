Abstract    :
              This project examines the growing importance of finance in the American economy
              and its relationship to state policy.  It defines financialization as the phase
              of capitalist development in which accumulation occurs largely through
              financial channels in the investment, insurance, and real estate sectors.  Such
              growth of the finance sector replaces traditional channels of accumulation
              through trade and commodity production.  The investigator suggests that the
              growth began with the crisis of Keynesianism in 1968 and continued into the
              decade of the 1970s.  To evaluate this argument, the project uses data from
              national income accounts, financial newspapers, federal reserve documents,
              congressional records, and interviews with policy makers to answer three
              questions:   1) To what extent is financialization occurring in the American
              economy in the post-1970 period?  2) What configuration of political forces
              within the state promoted the turn to finance?  3) How has financialization
              altered patterns of state intervention in economy?
