This project will develop and test techniques for
              extracting quantitative data on cross-shore and along-shore currents in the
              near-shore zone from video images.  One of the motivations is to obtain better
              data on shear waves in the near-shore zone.  Results of the video analysis
              algorithms will be compared with in situ data from the same site.  Both video
              and in situ data were collected during an earlier experiment at Duck, N.
              Carolina.   Measurements of currents derived from the video data at ten
              different sites will be incorporated into a numerical model of finite-amplitude
              shear waves in a study of the effects of bottom dissipation and horizontal
              mixing on these waves.
