              ABSTRACT

OCE-0117895

The source functions and geochemical pathways of 26Al
              (half-life 0.72 My) and 10Be (1.5  My) in the sea are closely linked.  These
              radioisotopes, produced mainly by the interaction of  cosmic rays with the
              atmospheric constituents, enter the ocean via wet and dry fallout with a 
              nearly constant ratio and deposit to the seafloor through particle scavenging. 
              The scavenging  time of 10Be is comparable to the ocean mixing time of ~103
              years,but that of 26Al is about 30  times shorter.  As a consequence, 10Be is
              more readily transported to areas of high particle flux  or high productivity
              such as ocean margins, where the deposition ratio of 10Be/26Al becomes  much
              higher than their production ratio.  These features -relatively stable source
              function,  constant production ratio,and high particle reactivity with
              differential removal -render the two  nuclides as a pair suitable for tracing
              geochemical and geophysical processes.

In this project, researchers at the
              University of Southern California will evaluate the utility of the  10Be/26Al
              ratio in sediments as a proxy for paleo-particle flux or  paleoproductivity,
              and the use of the 3He/26Al ratio in sediment cores to probe the factors 
              affecting the flux of earth-bound interplanetary dust particles (IDP) and its
              variation with time.  Measurements of 10Be and 26Al will be carried out on
              samples of seawater, sediment-trap  material, and sediment, and of 3He in
              sediment cores.  Measurements of U-Th isotopes, 27Al,  9Be, opal, carbonates
              and other chemical components will also be made on sediment trap and  sediment
              samples.  Data so obtained will be used to study the spatial and temporal
              variations in  the distribution and flux of 10Be and 26Al and the mechanisms
              causing the variations.  The  influence of particle composition and
              remineralization on the sedimentary 10Be/26Al signals will  be investigated to
              constrain  better the 10Be/26Al proxy which will be applied to sediment cores 
              from the equatorial Pacific and the Antarctic to provide an understanding of
              the productivity  changes in areas characterized by high-nutrients and
              low-chlorophyll of the surface water.  Past  variations in IDP will be examined
              by the coupled measurements of 3He/26Al and 3He/230Th in  sediment cores.
