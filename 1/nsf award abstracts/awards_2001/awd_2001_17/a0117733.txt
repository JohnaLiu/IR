Abstract    :
              The project addresses an important, and somewhat neglected so far, topic in
              robotics - long reach robots. Cable-based robotic devices will be explored,
              covering questions of configuration design, trajectory planning, feedback
              control, fine motion control, and metrics for intelligent design.  Experimental
              validation will be performed on an eight degrees-of-freedom cable robot built
              in the PI's laboratory. The PI has adequate access to outside resources
              critical for the project.
