Description:  This award supports US-India
              cooperative research entitled "Microbe-Mineral Interaction Mechanisms Relevant
              to Precious Metal Extraction with Environmental Control."  The PIs will
              investigate bioprocessing for the enhanced  recovery of precious metals such as
              gold, silver and platinum and will focus on the mechanisms by which certain
              microbes adhere to different mineral surfaces and alter  interfacial
              properties.  These mechanisms are as yet not very clear.  During leaching,
              metal ions accumulate; some of which may confer toxicity to bacteria.  There is
              need to understand the toxic metal tolerance of selected bacteria and develop
              more efficient metal tolerant strains. 

Scope:  The collaborators for this
              research, P. Somasundaran, Columbia University and K. Natarajan, Indian
              Institute of Science, Bangalore, have worked successfully in the past and have
              published in major international journals.  Due to growing environmental
              awareness during the past decade, the use of  biotechnology has become
              attractive as an environmentally benign, cost and energy efficient means for
              mineral beneficiation and environmental control.  This project is jointly
              supported by the Division of International Programs and the Government of
              India's Department of Science & Technology.
