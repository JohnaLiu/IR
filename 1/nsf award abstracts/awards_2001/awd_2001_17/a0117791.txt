Abstract    :
              This project examines a long-overlooked source of educational disadvantage in
              inner-city communities - the increased involvement of youth in general and
              urban minority youth in particular in the juvenile justice system.  On one
              hand, juvenile justice systems have long attempted to include education in its
              rehabilitative mission.  One the other hand, criminalization of youth may make
              school achievement all the more difficult.  The project thus investigates how
              arrest and detention of juveniles exert positive and negative effects on
              academic performance.  To do so, the investigator first analyzes quantitative
              data on 876 poor and minority Chicago youth arrested or detained between 1992
              and 1999.  Second, the investigator conducts face-to-face informal interviews
              with a random sample of 20 youths ages 18-19 to obtain qualitative data on
              experiences in school before and after criminal sanctions.  The results from
              both data sources provide unique insights into how the juvenile justice system
              shapes the experiences and educational outcomes of juvenile offenders.
