Abstract    :
              This research will examine a suite of cores from the Peten Lakes District in
              Guatemala to examine the pre-Holocene record of climate change in tropical
              lakes that did not dry out in the last glacial.  The sediments of these lakes
              contain the potential for preserving a unique and full record of rapid climate
              change from an area of the world with few continuous climate records.
