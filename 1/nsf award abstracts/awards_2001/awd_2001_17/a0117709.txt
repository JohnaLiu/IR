Description:  This project supports a US-Egypt Workshop on
              Research and Development in Telecommunication Technology to be held in Cairo,
              Egypt, December 2001- January 2002.  The organizers are Dr. Magdy Iskander,
              Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake
              City, and Dr. Ayman El-Dessouki, President, Electronics Research Institute
              (ERI), Cairo, Egypt.  Dr. Fatma El-Hefnawi, ERI, will also help plan the
              meeting.  Discussions will focus on advances in telecommunication technologies
              and R&D needs for next-generation telecommunication systems.  Example of topics
              to be discussed include:  multidisciplinary research, MEMS technology, low-cost
              phased area antennas, innovative device designs based on photonic band gap
              structures, and advanced propagation models.

Scope:  This award encourages
              discussion among US and Egyptian scientists on an area of great importance to
              both countries.   Potential collaborative research areas will be identified. 
              Dr. Iskander has successfully managed an NSF program to promote wireless
              communications research in the United States.  Dr. El-Dessouki is the head of
              the largest research organization in this field in Egypt and will invite
              persons from academia, industry, and government labs to the workshop.  Several
              junior scientists will be among the US workshop participants.  This workshop is
              also funded the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to
              scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out collaborative
              activities, by funds from the Division of International Programs and from the
              Division of Electrical and Communication Systems.
