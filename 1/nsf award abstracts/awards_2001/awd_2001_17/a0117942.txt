Abstract    :
              Information about the species of the earth resides in a wide variety of
              databases scattered over the earth.  Four institutions that each support
              environmental and species information across many taxa will do a feasibility
              study on the development of software tools that will enable cross platform
              querying and virtual integration of the data.  The team will use common data
              exchange standards to insure the broad utility of their developed software. 
              The consortium will develop this prototype infrastructure framework for
              retrieving and disseminating comprehensive information on species of the world.
               This prototype can then be extended to other species related data resources
              and may form the basis for future development of a widely accepted standard for
              species data exchange.  All of the documents generated will be available on the
              Species2000 web site.
