Science Summary:  This proposal requests support for a study to test
              the hypothesis that reorganization of atmospheric circulation and,
              specifically, changes in upwelling-favorable winds, was a major factor driving
              millennial variability in the intensity of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) off
              the west coast of North America.  The study will employ measurement of
              231Pa/230Th and 10Be/230Th ratios in samples from cores forming a north-south
              transect along the continental margin to deduce past changes in wind-driven
              productivity.  The proxies were selected because they are insensitive to
              sediment focusing and to changes in bottom water oxygen content and thus should
              be reliable indicators of local productivity variations.
