This grant provides support for 12 US and 13 African chemists
              to participate in a three-day US-Africa workshop on Environmental Chemistry and
              Water Quality:  Exploring Collaborative Opportunities for Research,
              Applications, and Education, to be held in Dakar, Senegal, July 26-28, 2001.
              The workshop is being jointly co-organized by Drs. John Malin and Bradley
              Miller, of the Office of International Activities at the American Chemical
              Society, and Dr. T. M. Letcher, with the Department of Chemistry at Natal
              University, Durban, South Africa.  The workshop will precede the 8th Annual
              International Conference on Chemistry in Africa and the 2nd Congress of the
              African Association for Pure and Applied Chemistry. There will be a total of
              approximately 30 participants, with expertise in chemical research and
              remediation methods, analytical techniques, and higher level chemical
              education.  US presenters include investigators from academia, and governmental
              and industrial institutions.  The majority of African participants will be
              chemists in the early stages of their careers. 

Having adequate quantities
              of high-quality water is a critical component for Africa's social and economic
              development.  Within the workshop's overarching theme of environmental
              chemistry, the main focus will be on the specific advances in the chemical
              sciences that can be applied to problems of water quality in Africa.  Attendees
              will share information on their current activities and identify mutual areas of
              research interest for future collaborative projects.  They will also explore
              ways to build partnerships across chemically related sectors associated with
              pollution prevention and control.  This workshop will serve as a catalyst to
              provide fresh knowledge of environmental chemistry's strengths and weaknesses
              in the region.  The project supports the participation of two junior US faculty
              members. 

This workshop is jointly supported by the Division of
              International Programs and the Division of Chemistry.
