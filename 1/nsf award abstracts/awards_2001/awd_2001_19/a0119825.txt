Abstract    :
              The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries play a vital role in maintaining
              and promoting a healthy population, and constitute a major sector of the US
              economy.  These industries have evolved from the empirical treatment of disease
              to a sophisticated approach for drug development which requires a deeper
              understanding of the biochemistry of life processes.  As a consequence, the
              accurate description of biomolecular interactions has become a central element
              in understanding disease mechanisms, and now is an essential ingredient for
              devising safe and effective pharmaceuticals.  A variety of instruments and
              methods are used to characterize biomolecular interactions.  This I/UCRC will
              enable pharmaceutical and biotechnological, and instrumentation companies to
              work together toward the development of advanced technologies for
              characterizing molecular interactions.
