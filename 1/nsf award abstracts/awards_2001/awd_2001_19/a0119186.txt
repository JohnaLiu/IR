Abstract    :
              As the amount of information available in online data sources explodes, there is
              a growing concern about the consistency and quality of answers to user queries.
              This project addresses the issue of using logical integrity constraints to
              gauge the consistency and quality of query answers. Although it is impractical
              to enforce global integrity constraints across different data sources and
              correct integrity violations by updating individual sources, integrity
              constraints capture important semantic properties of data. This project studies
              the formal notions of database repair and consistent query answer: a consistent
              answer is true in every minimal repair of the database. The information about
              answer consistency serves as an important indication of its quality and
              reliability. A variety of procedures for computing consistent query answers in
              the context of the relational data model and SQL are developed, and their
              computational complexity analyzed. The procedures exploit the properties of
              specific subsets of SQL and specific classes of integrity constraints. By
              providing information about query answer consistency, such procedures will
              enhance the functionality of existing DBMS in a non-intrusive way, particularly
              in the context of data integration applications.
