Abstract    :
              The response of the Earth's magnetosphere to the effects of the solar wind is
              complex and non-linear.  The behavior exhibits features characteristic of
              coupling over multiple spatial and temporal scales.  This project will develop
              models of the magnetosphere based on the framework of phase transitions and
              multi-scale coupling.  Data from ground-based and spacecraft-based instruments
              will be used to study the time evolution of various features in the
              magnetosphere.  Techniques such as nonlinear filters, multifractal spectra,
              mutual information, and multi-scale singular spectrum analysis will be used to
              characterize the observed features.  These studies will complement models based
              on first principles.
