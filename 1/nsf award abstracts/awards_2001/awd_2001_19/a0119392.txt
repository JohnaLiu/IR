The objectives of this project are: (1) to encourage
              undergraduate electrical, mechanical, computer engineering, and Allied Health
              students to conduct senior-year design projects in rehabilitation engineering,
              and (2) to focus such design projects towards the needs of specific individuals
              with orthopedic and/or neuromuscular disabilities. Students are recruited from
              the class rosters of the Departments of Allied Health, Occupational Therapy
              (OT), and Electrical Engineering, and elective course registrants from the
              mechanical, industrial and computer engineering departments. It is expected
              that 7 design projects will be completed each year of the three year program.
              

Clients have been identified in the greater Milwaukee area who would
              benefit from the proposed senior design projects. The significance of the
              program is (I) exposing undergraduate engineering students to the field of
              rehabilitation engineering at a formative stage in their educational
              development might sensitize them towards the role of this profession in a
              rehabilitation setting; (II) exposing occupational therapy students to more
              in-depth characteristics of assistive technology device performance in order
              for them to be able to determine demands imposed on a device by a person with a
              disability; (III) by forming small design groups that comprise engineering and
              OT students, engineering students may grasp the physiologic and functional
              limitations necessary for effective problem formulation and solution; (IV) the
              students from Allied Health should learn why certain engineering components are
              used and to acquire the knowledge necessary to deal with vendors of assistive
              technology; (V) the students will be rewarded in contributing towards solving
              limitations imposed by physical impairments, and; (VI) the client will benefit
              by having the specialized technology that could enable independence, potential
              employment, or completion of schooling.
