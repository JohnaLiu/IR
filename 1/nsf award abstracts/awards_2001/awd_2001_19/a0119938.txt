Abstract    :
              The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem has been described as both the quintessential
              American wilderness and a battle zone that pits humans against nature. 
              Controversial issues range from socio-economic concerns (e.g., rural
              development and subdivisions) to basic ecology (e.g., the relationship between
              elk and vegetation).  The future health of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem
              depends as much on human decision-making dynamics as on biophysical processes
              and environmental change.  The long-term goal of this project is to integrate
              biophysical and decision-making models into a framework that allows exploration
              of future scenarios that include likely social and environmental stressors. 
              This incubation project will enable a team-building and data-gathering exercise
              as part of the larger effort to couple mass balance and bioenergetics models
              with cognitive models that represent the decision making process.  An
              interdisciplinary research team will be assembled to guide model design, and
              stakeholder perspectives will be collected during the project.
