The PANGA consortium will install 8
              continuously operating GPS stations in Puget Sound in a rapid response
              deployment to the Nisqually earthquake. This enhancement of PANGA is aimed at
              gathering basic data to answer opportune scientific questions. It also provides
              a demonstration of the ability of the Plate Boundary Observatory community to
              master the technical challenges of a post-earthquake response in a
              collaborative manner.
The continuous GPS observations will further our
              understanding of these scientific issues:
1. Is the series of slab deformation
              events recorded in 1939,1946 and 1949 a typical sequence, and will we observe a
              similar sequence in the 1999 Grays Harbor, 2001 Nisqually, and some near term
              future event(s)?
2. How is deformation propagated from a down going slab
              through a viscoelastic lower lithosphere, to surface deformation? What are the
              rheologies that govern this complex scenario and how is deformation propagated
              or dissipated? 
3. How do these processes reveal the budget of seismic vs.
              aseismic slip? 
4. Is there a causal relationship between intra-slab
              earthquakes and deformation in the brittle upper crust?
5. How does the
              concentration of deformation across the Puget Lowlands, where fore-arc
              migration ends in a zone of concentrated strain, relate to arching of the
              down-going slab and its consequent deformation?
6. Is there an observable role
              between deeper, slab events with their broad deformation field, and
              teconomagmatic deformation?
