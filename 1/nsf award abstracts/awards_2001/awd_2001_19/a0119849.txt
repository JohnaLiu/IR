INGEOS Indians into Geological Sciences


This program
              establishes, develops, and enhances INGEOS (Indians into Geological Sciences). 
              INGEOS is designed to build collaboration between a tribal college (White Earth
              Tribal and Community College, Mahnomen, Minnesota) and a major geoscience
              research institution (the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, North
              Dakota).  INGEOS inititates a three-year pilot, dual-institution (major
              research university and tribal college), co-principal investigator-managed
              program specifically designed to bring Indian students up to and above the
              baccalaureate and masters level in the geosciences and to prepare them
              competitively for successful geoscience careers.  INGEOS initiates an
              eight-point approach to academic success in a comprehensive retention-oriented
              program.  These eight points include: mental health and challenge, physical
              health, social integration, financial management, technical exposure and
              experience, research exposure and experience, teaching experience (graduate
              students), and conference attendance.
