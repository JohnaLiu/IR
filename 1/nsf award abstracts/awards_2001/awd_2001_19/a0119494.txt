The development of a technology for performing endoscopic cellular
              level imaging inside the body would have a powerful impact on biomedical
              research and health care. This program is a collaboration between investigators
              at UCLA specializing in MEMS optical technology and investigators at MIT
              specializing in biomedical optical imaging. The investigators propose to
              develop new microscanning MEMS devices and endoscopically integrate them with
              optical coherence tomography, confocal microscopy, and optical coherence
              microscopy, creating a new technology for internal body imaging.  Vertically
              integrated studies combining novel MEMS device design with biomedical imaging
              and clinical feasibility studies will be performed.
