Abstract    :
              	This project will complete an extensive database on the personal, social,
              economic, career, and political attributes of judges who served on the U.S.
              Courts of Appeals.  Under a prior NSF award, SBR-9311999, information was
              assembled for all judges who were commissioned from 1801 through 1992.  This
              project will now add the judges appointed by Bill Clinton.  The database will
              include conventional social background variables, such as appointing president,
              religion, political party affiliation, education, and prior experience, along
              with unique items such as the temporal sequence of prior career experiences,
              the timing of and reason for leaving the bench, position histories, rating by
              the American Bar Association, and net worth.  This project will also merge the
              appellate court database with a parallel database on U.S. district court
              judges.  The merged data will contain the widest range of information on all
              lower federal court judges to serve from 1789 to 2000.
