Abstract    :
              This SGER will explore the development of algorithms that abstract biological
              information processes into software.  The algorithms will work on different
              computer systems using CORBA middleware technology and agents.  The abstraction
              of biological complexity will enable the modeling of high level objects.  The
              original focus will be on developing graphical interfaces and modeling genomic
              objects and computational models of emotion. The choice of the model systems
              was determined by considering how many different areas of science might have
              input and get something out of the tools that are developed. The results will
              feed into learning issues at both the computational and pedagogical levels, as
              well as how biological objects interact from a computer science perspective. 
              This in turn will enable research into gene regulatory networks, functional
              genomics and signal encoding in ensembles of neurons.
