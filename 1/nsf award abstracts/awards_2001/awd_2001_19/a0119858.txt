Title:   Catching Up:  A Longitudinal Study in Latino Participation
              in the Information Economy  

This award provides support for a 3-year study
              to better understand the factors relevant to Latino's involvement in
              Information Technology (IT) careers.  The study will examine various factors
              influencing the attenuated representation of Latinos in IT jobs, career paths,
              and appropriate educational experiences.  The research approach will be
              longitudinal using a cross-sectional approach to gather quantifiable as well as
              qualitative data that encompasses the many decisions and influences that occur
              between late-adolescence and early IT careers.  The research approach will also
              be multi-level examining the decisions and behaviors of Latinos as affected by:
              (1) family dynamics including socioeconomic standing, role models, and
              immigration history; (2) school structure, policies, student population, and
              programs, at three levels within K-16; (3) community characteristics and
              dynamics; and (4) regional economies and markets.  Data will be gathered from
              four metropolitan areas with high concentrations of Latino residents: Los
              Angeles, Houston, Chicago and New York.
