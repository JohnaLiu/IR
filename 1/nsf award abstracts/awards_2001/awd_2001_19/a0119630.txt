Pruning Techniques for More Expressive Planning



This is the first
              year funding of a two year continuing award.   Solving more expressive planning
              problems is important because many practical problems fall in this category.  
              It is important to be able to control search in the synthesis of these plans. 
              This project involves development of various pruning techniques for more
              expressive planning.  These are based on identifying various flaws in partial
              plans and the costs of resolving them.  An efficient conjunctive planner and an
              efficient disjunctive planner will be modified to handle universal quantifiers,
              functions, metric time and continuous variables.   These planners will use
              pruning techniques developed in this project.   The results of the project will
              improve understanding of efficient synthesis of plans in more expressive
              domains like NASA's Deep Space One mission.
