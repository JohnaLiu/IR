              ABSTRACT

BUILDING ON OUR SUCCESS: A PROPOSAL TO ENHANCE AND IMPROVE MINORITY
              STUDENT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION IN THE GEOSCIENCES AT THE UNIVERISTY OF NEW
              ORLEANS

For the past 27 years, the Department of Geology and Geophysics at
              the University of New Orleans (UNO) has managed a program for recruiting and
              graduating BS and MS African-American and Hispanic geoscientists.  The primary
              tools for minority student recruitment have been a summer field trip for
              outstanding high school juniors and seniors, and scholarship support.  This
              program emphasizes not only recruitment of outstanding high school students,
              but also the training and certification of local teachers through a Masters in
              Science Teaching (MAST) program.

This award will expand and enhance the
              existing program of recruitment, retention, and graduation of minority students
              and teachers by taking actions that will also help to it become self-sustaining
              at the end of the period.  Creating an advisory panel that consists mostly of
              former UNO minority-student graduates, now employed in local industry,
              academia, and government agencies is an important first step.  The panel will
              assist in mentoring middle-high school, undergraduate and graduate students,
              and serve as a resource to faculty to better understand recruitment issues. 
              The award will also expand a competitive, high school level summer program in
              environmental science open to local students in their freshman through senior
              years of high school.  The outreach program will be expanded to include local
              middle schools where earth science is taught.  A visiting scholars program will
              also be established.
