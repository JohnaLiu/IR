Abstract for Project "Collaborative Research: Field
              Investigation of Transient Effects of the 2001 Republic Day, India
              Earthquake"

Field seismological and geological studies of the devastating
              earthquake of January 26, 2001 in India are being carried out to collect
              information about transient phenomena, including aftershocks and surface
              effects. This earthquake, called the Republic Day earthquake, had a magnitude
              of about 7.7 and was an unusual earthquake. It occurred in western India, far
              from the plate boundary between India and Eurasia. The Republic Day earthquake
              was an intraplate earthquake, with unusual characteristics. A network of about
              two dozen seismographs is to be operated for a period of 3 to 6 months to
              record and locate aftershocks. Related field geological studies are to be done
              to learn about the liquefaction and other surface effects produced by the
              mainshock. The hypocenter of the mainshock was relatively deep in the crust for
              such a large earthquake (25 km) and no surface faulting has been found from it.
              Recordings from the temporary network will help confirm the depth of the
              mainshock as well as information about the mainshock fault mechanism.
