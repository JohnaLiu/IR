The objective of the proposed research is to develop a method of
              optically imaging proteins.  This research will adapt newly developed methods
              for peptide/protein ligation for labeling various proteins and imaging them via
              improved fluorescence or other molecular imaging probes.  The ability to study
              proteins in situ has come from the introduction of the green Fluorescent
              protein (GFP).  The goal of this research is to generate reporters that share
              the power of GFP, but without its limitations.  The specific goals of this
              research are to generate reporters that: (1) can be genetically engineered into
              proteins, (2) are significantly smaller than GFP, (3) have a narrower emission
              spectra than GFP, (4) emit further in the red range or have a larger Stokes
              shift than GFP, (5) are more photostable than GFP, (6) can be used to
              simultaneously label and distinguish different proteins in living cells, and
              (7) can be used to track proteins or cells as they move throughout an animal's
              body.
