              ABSTRACT
Reaching Out to Kids and Community with Science in San
              Francisco

The "Reaching Out to Kids and Community with Science in San
              Francisco (SF-ROCKS)" program at San Francisco State University (SFSU) aims to
              increase the number of traditionally underrepresented students who enter
              college as geoscience majors through a multi-faceted collaborative research
              project that will provide teacher training, student education, and several
              tiers of mentoring relationships. The activities include: (1) strengthening
              partnerships with the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) by engaging
              high school teachers and their students in supervised environmental research
              projects and training; (2) building bridges between SFSU and City College of
              San Francisco (CCSF), where many underrepresented students in San Francisco are
              first introduced to geoscience at the college level; and (3) fostering
              mentoring relationships among SFSU geosciences faculty, undergraduate students,
              and high school students through guidance and supervision of field projects.
              SF-ROCKS also partners with local community groups and government agencies for
              project support and mutual benefit. 

The collaborative program has a
              research base at SFSU and satellite centers at CCSF and five high schools in
              eastern San Francisco in the Islais and Mission creek watersheds. At each
              satellite center, instructors responsible for teaching earth and environmental
              science work with SFSU Department of Geosciences project scientist to develop a
              community- centered, multi-layered, hands-on mapping and sampling partnership
              to identify and to monitor environmental hazards and watershed characteristics.
              Each satellite center focuses on the area around their school, with connections
              to the other centers via teacher workshops, interactions with the SFSU research
              base, and a comprehensive interactive web site.
