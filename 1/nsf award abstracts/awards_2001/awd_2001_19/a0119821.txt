Abstract    :
              This planning grant supports activities that will lead to a full research
              proposal on the interactions between land use change, land cover change, and
              climate change at the regional scale in East Africa.  Plans include a workshop
              in East Africa, concept development for modeling, and a concept paper.  The
              grant will enable team members from the U.S., Africa, and the U.K. to
              collaborate effectively in these activities and to establish modalities for
              collaborative preparation of the full proposal and implementation of the
              research project.  Foreign partner institutions include the University of East
              Anglia, U.K., and the International Livestock Research Institute, located in
              Nairobi, Kenya.  The research proposes application of methods, models, and
              analytical frameworks used in Climate Change analysis and Land Use/Cover Change
              studies for integrated assessment of climate and its interactions with land
              use.  The scientific focus will be on examination of the linkages between
              climate and land-use change, between land-use change and land-cover change, and
              between land-cover change and regional climate modeling.  Important issues
              fundamental to an understanding of these linkages include interactions between
              spational and temporal scales, indirect and non-linear affects, and uncertainty
              and complexity.  A more effective understanding of these linkages will have
              societal benefits under climate change, providing guidance for land and
              resource managers in East Africa and elsehwere.  The project will facilitate
              development of international interdisciplinary collaborations, with education
              and training opportunities for U.S. and African graduate students.

This
              project is an award emanating from the FY 2001 special competition in
              Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural
              and Human Systems.
