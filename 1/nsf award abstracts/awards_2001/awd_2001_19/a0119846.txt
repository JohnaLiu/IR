Abstract    :
              This work will investigate the details of how the plasma transported by the
              solar wind interacts with the plasma inside the magnetosphere near the dayside
              magnetopause.  The study will use semi-global, three-dimensional hybrid
              simulations in which the electrons are treated using a fluid approximation, but
              the ions are treated using a kinetic particle description.  The 3-D simulations
              will provide a study of the magnetopause with more realistic boundaries than
              have been studied in the past.  Shear flow, curvature of the boundary, and
              coupling of boundaries and the motion of boundaries will all be included.  The
              regions of study will include the bow shock, the magnetosheath and the
              magnetopause.
