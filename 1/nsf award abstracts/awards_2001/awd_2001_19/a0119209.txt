Abstract    :
              This award is funding to permit the History of Science Society (HSS), Society
              for the History of Technology (SHOT), Philosophy of Science Association (PSA),
              and Society for Social Studies of Science (4S) to provide travel awards to
              graduate students and independent scholars--with no access to funding--to
              attend the annual meetings of the societies during the five-year period
              2001-2005. It also asks for travel funds to allow the respective president,
              secretary, and editor of each society to meet each year in order to foster
              cooperation among these five societies.
