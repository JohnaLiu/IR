Abstract    :
              This workship will bring together biologists, anthropologists, and
              archaeologists engaged in research on etnobiology, together with applied
              mathematicians, to identify future directions to facilitate growth and
              maturation on the field.  The workshop will be organized in two parts:  an
              initial 3-day workshop of the organizing committee of mid-career leaders in the
              field, followed by a widely advertised seminar to which attendance will be
              open.  The workshop will attempt to define and focus research objectives;
              explore modern methodology appropriate for studying plant/animal-people
              interactions; assess and strengthen techniques for quantitative analyses of
              multidisciplinary data; develop interdisciplinary education models to train
              students and practicioners of ethnobiology; and develop strategies to improve
              access to academic funding sources.  International research partners from the
              International Society of Ethnobiology will attend.  The participants will be
              pledged to apply the insights and collaborative linkages developed in the
              workshop to preparing competitive proposals in etchnobiology to submit to
              relevant programs in NSF.  The output will be a bulletin defining the
              intellectual imperatives in ethnobiology, which will be broadly distributed to
              professional societies, universities, government agencies and nongovernmental
              organizations.

There are a variety of practical problems that would benefit
              from a more holistic and theoretically strong ethnobiology discipline.  Due to
              the global nature of the workshop and the involvemente of foreign participants,
              the impact on research and education could be global in scope.

This project
              is an award emananting from the FY 2001 special competition in Biocomplexity in
              the Envionment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems.
