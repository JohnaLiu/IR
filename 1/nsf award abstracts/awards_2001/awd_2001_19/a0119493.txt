The objective of the proposed research is to develop and build
              compact absorption spectrometers and fluorescence measurement systems with the
              capability to test and identify the composition of picoliters of analyte.  The
              approach is to integrate microfabrication techniques for both microfluidic and
              photonic devices in order to create monolithic analysis "chips" for
              bio-analysis applications.  Specifically, three optical technologies will be
              developed and integrated into microfluidic systems: (1) Fabry-Perot optical
              resonators with high-finesse for optical spectroscopy, (2) photonic crystal
              nanocavities for interferometric sensing with high sensitivity, and (3)
              development of manufacturable solid immersion lenses for high numerical
              aperture examination of microfluidic samples.
