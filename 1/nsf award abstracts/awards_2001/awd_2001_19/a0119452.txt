Abstract    :

Fujimoto
The development and application of biomedical imaging
              technologies such as multiphoton confocal microscopy and optical coherence
              tomography are critically dependent on the availability of ultrashort pulse
              laser light sources. The lack of compact and low cost ultrashort pulse light
              sources is a critical factor which limits wider spread research and clinical
              applications of many of these imaging technologies. The objective will be to
              develop a third generation ultrashort pulse laser technology which achieves
              shorter pulse durations, broader bandwidths and broader tunability, as well as
              being one order of magnitude lower in cost than current technology. The design
              principles that are developed will be applicable to a wide range of different
              solid state laser materials. This proposed project is a continuation of an
              ongoing collaboration between Profs. Fujimoto and Kaertner at the Massachusetts
              Institute of Technology. Professor Franz Kaertner is currently at the
              University of Karlsruhe, but will be joining the faculty in the Department of
              Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology in the Summer of 2001.
