This Americas award will support a planning visit by Dr.
              Scott E. Ishman of Southern Illinois University-Carbondale to finalize a
              cooperative research project with Drs. Ruben E. Martinez of the National Museum
              of Natural History, Rodolfo Martinez of San Pedro Nolasco College and Luis A.
              Chirino of Museo Fonck, all in Chile, respectively.  The researchers will meet
              in Antofagasta and Santiago, Chile and will do site visits to localities in the
              Mejillones region of Chile.

The northern region of Chile provides a unique
              geographic setting to investigate the oceanographic and climatic sensitivity of
              the eastern South Pacific to significant changes in Antarctic ice volume change
              as interpreted from sea-level records.  The Mejillones Basin is ideal for this
              research.  It represents a shallow marine setting developed on an active margin
              with nearby volcanism and other significant tectonic features.  Results from
              this proposed project will provide a better understanding of the
              interconnection between Antarctic ice volume change, oceanographic and
              atmospheric circulation, and the impacts these have on recurring oceanographic
              and meteorological events such as El Nino, which have global and economic
              significance.
