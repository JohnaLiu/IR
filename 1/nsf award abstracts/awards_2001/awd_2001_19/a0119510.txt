Abstract    :
              A Proton-Transfer-Reaction Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS) instrument will be
              purchased and used for real-time, in-situ measurements of concentrations and
              fluxes of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in particular, terpenes. These
              compounds play an important role in the tropospheric photochemistry of forested
              regions. In situ concentrations and flux measurements carried out with the
              PTR-MS coupled to the eddy covariance method will be compared to measurements
              using gas chromatography coupled to relaxed eddy accumulation. Extension to
              ecosystem scale fluxes will be attempted. The PTR-MS will also be used for in
              situ measurements of oxidation products of terpenes. In addition, the PI will
              collaborate with the research group of Prof. John Seinfeld at Caltech on
              laboratory studies of VOC oxidation processes by using the PTR-MS as a product
              analysis tool.
