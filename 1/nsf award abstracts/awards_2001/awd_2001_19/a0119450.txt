Abstract    :

This proposal brings together scientists from very
              diverse areas with the goal of developing new photonic probes and contrast
              agents for highly sensitive and selective detection of pre-cancers in vivo . 
              Dr. Andrew Ellington will use the approaches of combinatorial chemistry to
              develop a library of aptamer molecules specific for biomolecular targets on the
              surface of cervical cancerous and pre-cancerous cells.  He will use
              well-established cervical cell lines at different stages of cancer development
              provided by Dr. Lotan.  Drs. Brian Korgel and Konstantin Sokolov will develop
              new photonic probes based on quantum dots (BK) and metal nanoparticles (KS).
              They will utilize both the aptamers developed by Dr. Ellington as well as
              well-known antibodies currently used in clinical histopathology.  Dr. Rebecca
              Richards- Kortum will test the conjugates as molecular specific contrast agents
              using optical microscopy and spectroscopy. She will use cervical cancer cell
              lines provided by Dr. Lotan, three-dimensional tissue phantoms and fresh
              cervical tissue slices from Dr. Follen.  Experiments with all three biological
              systems representing properties of normal and neoplastic cervix at different
              levels of complexity will be used to assess and refine the performance and
              detection scheme for the new contrast agents. This refinement will include
              preparing bioengineered aptamers with high affinity to cancer specific targets,
              tailoring optical properties of metal nanoparticles and quantum dots,
              optimizing conjugation procedures, and developing optimal imaging geometries.
