Abstract    :
              Due to the inherent instability of protein/peptide drugs in aqueous solution,
              the successful formulation of these compounds in lyophilized form has become an
              important activity within the pharmaceutical industry.  However, the extent to
              which the stability of a given protein/peptide is improved in the amorphous
              solid-state depends on many variables including moisture, temperature, the
              viscoelastic properties of the solid, chemical nature of the excipients and
              impurities present, and the nature of the degradation pathways.

Molecular
              dynamics simulations are uniquely suited to the exploration of various
              molecular details which are important in the degradation of proteins/peptides
              in amorphous solids.  The researchers will investigate how changes in molecular
              mobility and conformational flexibility in amorphous matrices influence both
              the formation of reactive intermediates and the subsequent partitioning of
              these reactive intermediates to products, which depends on the relative
              translational and rotational mobility of either the protein itself or smaller
              molecules which may be participants in the overall reaction.
