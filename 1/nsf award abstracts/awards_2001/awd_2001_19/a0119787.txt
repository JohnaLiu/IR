Abstract    :
              The Center for Informal Learning and Schools (CILS) is a five-year collaborative
              effort between the Exploratorium in San Francisco, the University of California
              at Santa Cruz, and King's College London.  The purpose of the Center is to
              study the intersection of informal science learning that takes place in museums
              and science centers and formal learning that takes place in schools, and to
              prepare leaders in informal science education.

Through the efforts of the
              center, new doctoral level leaders will be prepared who understand how informal
              science learning takes place and how informal institutions can contribute to
              science education reform.  A Ph.D. program will be offered to 16 individuals at
              King's College London (two cohorts of eight) and a post-doctoral program to six
              scientists interested in issues of learning and teaching in informal settings. 
              A doctoral program is planned at the University of California at Santa Cruz for
              24 students, 12 whose interests are primarily in education and 12 who come from
              the sciences.  In addition to doctoral level training, there will be a
              certification program for existing informal science professionals to better
              enable them to support teachers, students and the general public.  That program
              will provide 160 informal science educators 120 hours of professional
              development experiences, and an additional 24 informal science educators with a
              master's degree in informal science education at UC Santa Cruz.   A Bay Area
              Institute will be developed to serve as a central focus for all CILS
              activities.  It will bring together researchers and practitioners; it will
              offer courses and workshops for graduate students; and it will provide a
              central location for reporting research findings and methodologies that focus
              on how informal learning institutions can best contribute to science education
              reform.
