Abstract
The McMurdo Dry Valleys in southern Victoria
              Land, Antarctica, are the most expansive tracts of ice free land on the
              Antarctic continent.  Since March, 1995, two workshops have been supported by
              the National Science Foundation to address environmental concerns in the Dry
              Valleys and to begin to formulate a management plan for the area.  Increasing
              scientific activity as well as the potential for increased tourism have been
              the motivation for developing a more systematic approach to protection and
              management of activities in the Dry Valleys.  The first workshop produced a
              Code of Conduct that was recommended for use in planning and implementing
              activities in the Dry Valleys.  The workshop participants also recommended that
              a management plan be developed and that the plan be both interdisciplinary and
              international in nature.

The second workshop dealt primarily with
              environmental impacts on the lakes in the Dry Valleys.  The participants
              strongly recommended that the McMurdo Dry Valleys should be designated as an
              Antarctic Specially Managed Area (ASMA).  This proposal is for a workshop that
              brings together a small group of individuals, representing the various
              scientific and international interests in the area, to develop a draft ASMA
              plan that could then be vetted through appropriate channels for consideration
              within the Antarctic Treaty System.
