ITR: Measuring
              and Sustaining the New Economy

The Board on Science, Technology, and
              Economic Policy will conduct a study designed to identify and address the
              policy issues associated with the development and growth of the New Economy,
              stimulated by the growth of information technology.  The Board will identify
              and evaluate key issues associated with the measurement and analysis of the New
              Economy, the technologies underpinning its development, and the
              government-industry collaboration and regulatory framework necessary to sustain
              its growth.
