Ecologically healthy urban landscapes, including wetlands
              and natural areas, can help maintain water quality, water quantity, and
              biodiversity and fulfill human social and aesthetic needs.  However, some of
              the functions we desire urban wetlands to perform can impair the ability of
              these urban wetlands to perform other desired functions well.  This project
              will establish partnerships among public agencies, educators, and
              interdisciplinary teams of scientists from three regions of the US to summarize
              the state of our knowledge of wetlands in the urban landscape, and propose
              directions for future research.  A product of this research will be improved
              understanding of complex relationships among wetland functions, as well as an
              understanding of social systems and community characteristics of urban areas in
              which wetlands are included and valued in the urban landscape.  This knowledge
              may assist planners in efforts to achieve optimal functioning of urban wetlands
              and natural areas at a landscape scale.
