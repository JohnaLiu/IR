Abstract    :
              This award will provide partial support for the Stig Lundquist Research
              Conference: "The Advancing Frontiers of Condensed Matter Physics".  The
              Conference will be held in Trieste, Italy, July 2-6, 2001, under the
              sponsorship of the Abdus Salam International Centre of Theoretical Physics
              (ICTP.  The theme of the Conference is Non-Conventional Systems and New
              Directions".  Funds will be used to support the travel and local expenses of
              advanced graduate students, postdocs and young faculty from the United States. 
              Core support for the Conference will be provided by the ICTP, with additional
              support provided by the Office of Naval Research.  An excellent agenda and
              speaker list will address major developments taking place in "hard" and "soft"
              condensed matter physics, and the interface between physics and
              biology.

This award will provide partial support for the travel and local
              expenses of advanced graduate students, postdocs and young faculty from the
              United States to attend an international Conference in Trieste, Italy, July
              2-6, 2001.  The Conference deals with the frontiers of condensed matter
              physics, and will address traditional areas of solid state physics, such as
              superconductivity, as well as areas of soft condensed matter, like colloids,
              polymers, rheology, etc.  These topics relate to biological materials such as
              bone minerals (hard materials) and tissue (soft materials).  Thus the interface
              between physics and biology will also be addressed during the
              conference.
