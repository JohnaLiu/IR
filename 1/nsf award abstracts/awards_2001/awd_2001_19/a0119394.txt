Abstract    :
              The National Science Foundation supports the Boston University Conference on
              Language Development to be held at Boston University, 2-4 November, 2001. The
              conference is an internationally recognized meeting for researchers in the
              areas of first and second language acquisition, bilingualism, language
              disorders, and literacy development. It is attended by 400-500 researchers from
              around the world. Its presentations are chosen by anonymous peer review, and
              its proceedings are published by Cascadilla Press. This year's keynote speaker
              is Susan Carey; this year's plenary speaker is Daniel Dinnsen. Since 1976, the
              faculty and students of Boston University's Applied Linguistics Program have
              organized and run the conference. Dr. Shanley Allen leads this year's team of
              students and faculty.
