Abstract    :
              This project will examine the potential effect of climate warming on the annual
              storage and/or release of carbon dioxide from tundra on the western Alaska
              North Slope.  The measurements will be made with eddy flux towers in Barrow,
              Atqasuk, and Ivotuk Alaska and the results compared to remote sensing data from
              the MODIS satellite instruments.  This study represents a continuation and
              expansion of a long-term examination of terrestrial responses to climate change
              on the Alaska North Slope.  This phase of the study will examine variations of
              carbon dioxide flux in response to oscillations of the Arctic Oscillation on
              seasonal, annual, and decadal time scales.  The regional results will be used
              in computer simulations of the ecosystem in order to build a predictive
              capacity to the research as more is known about climate change in the region.
              The acclimation of the ecosystem and soil moisture from temporal changes in net
              ecosystem carbon flux will be determined over varying time-scales.  The study
              is important to understanding regional and annual patterns, particularly the
              variability, of carbon dioxide flux from tundra ecosystems at a time when
              climate warming appears to be affecting the terrestrial environment.
