              Innovation: Enhancing the CS Undergraduate Curriculum to Include Data Mining
              and Information Retrieval

This project involves the development (and
              introduction into the undergraduate computer science curriculum) of two new
              courses: Data Mining and Information Retrieval. In this sequence, students
              build systems that implement key data mining and information retrieval
              algorithms and learn how to apply these algorithms to solve real-world
              problems. At the end of this sequence, students understand and use the
              fundamental algorithms and existing state-of-the-art in web search engines,
              intranets, data mining, and customer relationship management. Two significant
              group projects provide students with experience as participants of a software
              development team. These projects enable larger implementation achievements that
              further the understanding of algorithms, implementation trade-offs and software
              project management. In addition, such a group project is a critical experience
              that future employers and graduate schools look for.
