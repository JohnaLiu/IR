Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

This proposal requests funds for an international conference called
              "Climate and Biota of the Early Paleogene," which will bring together
              scientists from multiple disciplines.  including climate and ocean modeling,
              paleoceanography, a variety of subdisciplines in paleontology, stable isotope
              and trace element geochemistry, paleosols, stratigraphy,
sedimentology and
              tectonics. During the 2  days of talk and poster sessions participants will lay
              out the most recent results of their research, and discuss avenues for research
              in the next decade. During the 1  days of field trips, participants will be
              guided through the classic continental sequences of Paleocene-Eocene rocks in
              the Bighorn Basin by the researchers who have done the primary work in this
              area. Participation by international scientists from a variety of disciplines
              is key to integrating records of climatic and biotic change from different
              parts of the world, and to broadening the perspectives of all participants.
              Three published products will result from this meeting: 1) an abstract volume
              to be published privately and distributed at the meeting to all participants; 
              2) a series of papers on the paleontology and geology of the Paleocene-Eocene
              sequence in the Bighorn Basin, along with a field guide and road log for the
              field trips to be published as a University of Michigan Paper on Paleontology;
              3) GSA Special Papers may also publish a proceedings volume from this meeting.
