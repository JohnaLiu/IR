Abstract    :
              The principal investigators (PIs) will investigate the mechanisms of tropical
              cyclone (TC) initiation and their roles in the maintenance of synoptic
              wavetrains observed in the Northwest Pacific. They hypothesize that the Rossby
              wave energy dispersion from northwest moving TCs induces equatorward and
              eastward synoptic wave disturbances. Through convective-circulation feedback,
              these disturbances have the potential of forming new tropical cyclones and
              repeating the cycle, thus maintaining the synoptic wavetrains. A
              three-dimensional, high-resolution tropical cyclone model, developed by one of
              the PIs, will be used to study this mechanism and related issues. An ocean
              model will be coupled with the TC model to investigate the effects of ocean
              feedback.  

This planned research holds promise for resolving a
              long-standing problem in tropical dynamics by identifying the processes
              responsible for the coexistence of tropical cyclones and wave-like
              disturbances. Resolution of the pertinent issues would expand our knowledge of
              tropical circulation systems.
