Gamma ray burst sources have been observed by
              gamma ray sensitive instruments onboard spacecraft for several years. The
              nature of these sources remain a mystery.  It has been known for sometime that
              there may be an optical event associated with the source that emits the Gamma
              Ray burst.  This optical event associated with the Gamma ray burst source has
              not been confirmed. Light curves of this optical event will reveal basic
              physical processes and the high spatial frequency sampling will provide
              information sufficient to provide positions accurate enough for rapid
              follow-up.  This experiment may enable the detection and characterization of
              the Gamma Ray burst source in the optical and infrared region of the
              electromagnetic spectrum and thus lead to a critical analysis of the engine
              responsible for the burst.
