SGER: Biogeochemical response mechanisms
              controlling nitrogen export from defoliated forests in the Eastern U.S.

The
              excessive leakage of dissolved nitrogen (N) from forests defoliated by insects
              has water quality ramifications for small acid-sensitive streams as well as for
              downstream receiving waters such as Chesapeake Bay. Controlled laboratory
              experiments have shed some light on these mechanisms, but they are of limited
              applicability to actual forest ecosystems. Few field studies have been
              conducted, primarily due to the relative unpredictability of defoliation
              outbreaks. The goal of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research project is to
              take advantage of the recently-forecasted reoccurrence of extensive gypsy moth
              defoliation in western Maryland. The investigators will conduct a detailed,
              process-based study of the biogeochemical mechanisms controlling N leakage from
              disturbed forests in this area by comparing rates of key biogeochemical
              processes controlling N leakage in forested plots subjected to gypsy moth
              defoliation with rates in plots not defoliated. In addition, the investigators
              intend to compare concentrations of dissolved N species in streams draining
              defoliated and reference watersheds and use remote sensing imagery to detect,
              map, and estimate the regional-scale extent and intensity of gypsy moth
              defoliation during the 2001 growing season.
