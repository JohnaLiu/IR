Abstract    :
              The research is focused on high speed coating of optical fibers, a step in the
              draw process that is critical to the quality and low cost fabrication of
              optical fibers for telecommunications and other applications.  It involves four
              main aspects (a) modeling and simulation of the transport processes within
              coating applicator/die systems, (b) experimentation with a laboratory off-line
              system developed previously, allowing measurements with different operating
              conditions, (c) experimentation on a full-scale draw tower, and (d) measurement
              of specific properties (thickness, concentricity, integrity, presence of
              bubbles, etc) of coatings produced under controlled conditions.  The models
              will be validated by experiments on the two facilities, particularly at large
              speeds.  The dependence of coating characteristics on the operating conditions
              will be established.  This approach will therefore provide a quantitative,
              systematic, and validated means to predict and control fiber-coating
              characteristics.
