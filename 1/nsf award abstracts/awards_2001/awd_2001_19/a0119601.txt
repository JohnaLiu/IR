Abstract    :
              The conference, Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology, provides a general
              forum for disseminating the most recent developments in bioinformatics.
              Bioinformatics has become an increasingly important tool for understanding
              biology, driven by genomic sequence efforts and other large data sets in
              biology. The meeting brings together scientists from computer science,
              molecular biology, mathematics and statistics.  The systems include
              cutting-edge software and database technologies.  Emphasis is placed on
              validation of methods using real data sets, on practical applications in the
              biological science and on development of novel computational techniques. The
              funds will provide travel support for students and young investigators who
              submit applications and are required to present either a paper or poster at the
              meeting.
