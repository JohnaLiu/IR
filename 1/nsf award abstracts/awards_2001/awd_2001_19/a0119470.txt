The objective of the proposed research is to develop a new
              method for laser photothermal phase-contrast imaging (LPPI) which has high
              absorption sensitivity and high resolution for sensing nano-scale
              non-fluorescent structures at the cellular and sub-cellular levels.  The
              specific research objectives are to: (1) evaluate spatial resolution and
              sensitivity of LPPI in a time-resolved mode by calibrating LPPI by using
              nano-scale liposomes as photothermal (PT) probes, (2) examine the effects of a
              laser pulse on a cell visualized by LPPI by comparing the time-resolved
              PT-image structure as a function of pump laser energy and wavelength with
              conventional biochemical data, and (3) develop cell PT spectral lifetime
              imaging and algorithms of PT time-resolved analysis of complex nano-scale
              absorbing structures verified with a multi-color PT probe model.
