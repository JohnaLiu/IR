Abstract    :
              This project is to build the institutional capacity and partnerships needed to
              develop a full center for teaching and learning at the University of Alabama at
              Birmingham.  A full center as it is envisioned will focus on issues of
              importance for teaching middle school science and mathematics in an urban
              setting.  Included are such issues as the recruitment of second career
              professionals, upgrading the knowledge and skills of existing teachers through
              improved professional development programs, learning how to take advantage of
              the abundant resources of informal science institutions that tend to be located
              in urban settings, and improving the undergraduate preparation of science and
              math teachers.  During this developmental project relationships will be
              developed with business, industry, the military and other sources of
              second-career teachers; a program will be developed to provide high school
              students with opportunities to teach science and mathematics to younger
              students; a leadership training program will be established to begin building
              the capacity to provide professional development to the teachers of Birmingham;
              and relationships will be developed with the McWane Science Center, existing
              outreach programs at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and the
              Birmingham Public Schools.
