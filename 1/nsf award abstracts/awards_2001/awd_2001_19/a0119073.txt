Abstract    :
              This is an experimental and theoretical investigation of the structure and
              extinction behavior of gaseous diffusion flames at low stretch rates.  The
              low-stretch condition is created by bottom-burning of a fuel mixture discharged
              from a porous axisymmetric burner of very large radius.  Fuels studied include
              methane, hydrogen, carbon monoxide/hydrogen, and carbon monoxide/methane. 
              Spatially resolved species, temperature, and velocity profiles are measured
              with laser diagnostics.  Flame radiation and burner-surface radiation are also
              examined.  Corresponding theoretical models are developed incorporating a
              narrowband radiation model.  The study consists of five elements:  (1)
              experimental determination of the flammability limit boundaries as functions of
              stretch rate and the amount of fuel dilution with emphasis on the radiation-
              induced extinction; (2) experimental exploration for the existence of
              "flamelets"; (3) experimental mapping of flame structure including
              hydrodynamic, thermal, and species profiles and radiation intensities from the
              flame and burner surface; (4) detailed modeling of low-stretch diffusion with
              detailed chemistry, transport properties, and flame/surface radiation; and (5)
              development of detailed radiation models including flame-surface interaction in
              a spectral manner and reevaluation of mean band parameters.
