Abstract    :
              This  project provides three years of partial  core support of the Board on
              Mathematical Sciences (BMS) and full core support of its Committee on Applied
              and Theoretical Statistics (CATS), both  groups  being committees of the
              National Research Council.  The BMS is the only  prominent  group in the United
              States wherein representatives from all the mathematical   sciences---core 
              mathematics,  statistics,  applied  mathematics, operations  research,  and
              scientific computing---regularly meet to discuss ways to  ensure and improve
              the intellectual vigor of the field.  CATS is perhaps the premier  assemblage 
              of  statistical  researchers  in  the  country,  and  it is similarly 
              concerned with the intellectual vigor of its field.  Both the BMS and CATS 
              actively promote that vigor by organizing workshops and studies that focus
              attention  on  research  opportunities that are ripe for exploration and,
              often, help  to  build  links  between  the  mathematical  sciences and other
              fields of science, engineering, and medicine.  To a lesser extent, they
              occasionally study policy issues that directly affect the health of the
              mathematical sciences.  The requested core funding provides for two meetings
              each year of both CATS and BMS, an  annual  Department Chairs Colloquium,
              initiation of all projects, continuous oversight  of  all activities, and
              continuing cognizance of issues that need the attention of BMS and/or CATS.
