Abstract    :
              This grant supports a continuation of the analysis of lightning flash and stroke
              characteristics across the United States using data from the National Lightning
              Detection Network (NLDN).  These data extend back to 1983.  To the American
              data will be added data from the Canadian Lightning Detection Network (CLDN),
              which was established in 1997.  The two networks combined comprise 187 sensors
              and provide data extending from 25 degrees to 60 degrees N latitude and from 50
              degrees to 135 degrees W longitude.  The number of recorded flashes on these
              networks exceeds 300 million.  The data are used for characterizing different
              properties of cloud-to-ground lightning, including flash polarity, the number
              of flashes per unit area, the peak current, and stroke multiplicity.  Studies
              are under way on the variation of these quantities with season and geographical
              location, and their dependence on local features such as mountains and cities. 
              There is already evidence of increased flash rates over urban areas, explained
              perhaps by increased convection over heated cities or by microphysical effects
              of pollution aerosols.  Other findings to now are that the highest peak
              currents are in the upper Midwest and the highest percentage of positive
              flashes to ground are along the West Coast of the United States.  Physical
              explanations for these findings will be sought as part of the project.
