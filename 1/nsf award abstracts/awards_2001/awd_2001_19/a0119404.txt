Abstract    :
              This developmental proposal aims to create an integrated South
Texas CLT.  The
              three institutional partners are The University of Texas --
Pan American, The
              University of Texas -- San Antonio, and The University of
Texas -- Austin. 
              The CLT will work primarily with school districts in San
Antonio and the lower
              Rio Grande Valley of south Texas.  More than 70% of the K-12
students are
              economically disadvantaged and almost 80% are Hispanic.  During
the
              developmental phase they will explicitly assess the regional
              science,
mathematics and technology  (SMT) educational needs and the
              specific
responsibilities of the participating institutions for meeting those
              needs
within a CLT.  They will also evaluate relevant existing models and
              project
strategies dealing with defined goals and objectives (e.g.,
              recruitment,
professional development, and/or pipeline infrastructures/career
              pathways
for SMT educator preparation) especially those appropriate for
              the
preparation of teachers of Hispanic students from bilingual, bicultural
              and
low socio-economic environments.  Part of the developmental process
              will
focus on developing models appropriate for meeting these goals and
              for
identifying other institutional partners including community colleges
              and
professional organizations.
