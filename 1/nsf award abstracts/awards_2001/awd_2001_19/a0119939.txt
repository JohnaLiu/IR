              ABSTRACT

Enhancing Diversity through the Penn State Weather
              Camp

Minorities are poorly represented in the geosciences in general and in
              the atmospheric sciences in particular.  Research experiences such as summer
              science camps are an effective means of introducing minority students to
              science.  The Penn State Weather camp provides an excellent opportunity to
              increase exposure to the atmospheric sciences of students from traditionally
              underrepresented groups.

This award will provide travel and registration
              costs for students from traditionally underrepresented groups to attend the
              Penn State Weather Camp during the 2002-2004 period.  Two one-week sessions are
              expected during this time period.  This camp provides a hands-on opportunity
              for students entering grades 8 through 10 to learn about fundamental aspects of
              meteorology.  Highlights of this camp include forecast contests, balloon
              launches, weather analysis, role playing as policy makers for climate change
              and creating a short TV broadcast.  On-camera meteorologists from the Weather
              Channel Inc. and WeatherWorld will train students.  Students from traditionally
              underrepresented groups will be surveyed at the camp and tracked afterward to
              determine if the camp has directly led to these students entering the
              geosciences or sciences.
