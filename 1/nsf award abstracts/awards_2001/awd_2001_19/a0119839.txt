Title:   Multiple Pathways towards Gender
              Equity in the Information Technology Workforce

This ITWF award provides
              support for a study of graduates of an information systems graduate program
              (MSIS) at Northeastern University, as well as men and women currently working
              in Information Technology (IT) positions, to understand the factors that
              influence entry and persistence of women in IT positions.  The MSIS program was
              designed for adult learners who wished to make a career transition to the IT
              field.  The research team will use the longitudinal data collected in the study
              to develop and validate a model that will predict women's IT career pathways.
