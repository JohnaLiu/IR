Abstract    :
              The relative importance of human and biophysical factors in vegetation change is
              often not apparent in the case of slow vegetation degradation processes.  One
              form of vegetation degradation common to rangelands is bush encroachment, which
              can result from chronic grazing and fire suppression.  The investigators in
              this project have chosen to study an encroached landscape on the Botswana-South
              Africa border.  The PIs will map historic bush encroachment and fires using
              historical aerial photographs and satellite images, and statistically relate
              these observations to several human and biophysical factors that vary spatially
              across the study area.  They will then develop a computer model that can
              simulate the complex interactions between the important human and biophysical
              factors over time, in a manner the reproduces observed patterns in bush
              encroachment.  This adaptive management model could prove helpful for guiding
              land management decisions not only in this study area but also similarly
              degraded rangelands elsewhere.
