Abstract    :
              This research aims to understand and automate the mechanisms by which language
              can emerge among artificial, knowledge-based and rational agents that interact
              in open, heterogeneous, and distributed environments. The intent is to design
              and implement agents that, upon encountering other agent(s) with which they do
              not share an agent communication language, are able to initiate creation of,
              and further are able to evolve and enrich, a mutually understandable
              communication language. The novelty of this research is that it enables the
              agents to develop and evolve, on their own, the capacity of communicating via a
              common language, as opposed to relying on this ability to be pre-designed and
              built into the agents by their designers. This research is supported by two
              streams of research, 1) the design of rational, socially competent artificial
              agents, and 2) the mechanism of negotiation as developed in game theory and
              automated in artificial intelligence research. This work will contribute to
              fundamental research in heterogeneous and open multiagent systems, effective
              communication among artificial agents in realistic settings, practical
              multiagent system design and the training of undergraduate and graduate
              students.
