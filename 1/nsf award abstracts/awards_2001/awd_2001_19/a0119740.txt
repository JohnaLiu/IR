              ABSTRACT

Online Weather Studies: Promoting Diversity and Collegial Faculty
              Development in Undergraduate Institutions Serving Minority Populations

The
              American Meteorological Society (AMS) proposes a project that will enable
              thousands of undergraduate minority students who would not otherwise have the
              opportunity to be introduced to studies in meteorology.  In cooperation with
              the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS), the Department of Geosciences at
              Elizabeth City State University, NC as focal point for a broad HBCU initiative,
              faculty members at numerous other minority-serving institutions across the
              country, and the highly regarded UCAR SOARS Program, the AMS proposes to
              increase access and opportunities for the educational and research
              participation of significant numbers of undergraduate students who are members
              of groups underrepresented in the geosciences.

This project will attain this
              goal by making available to minority-serving colleges and universities Online
              Weather Studies, an existing NSF-supported AMS-developed distance-learning
              course on the basics of meteorology, coupled with substantial faculty
              professional development and student mentoring programs.  Faculty development
              in this project features scientific and pedagogical components, along with
              in-depth treatment of diversity issues, appropriate to offering compelling
              meteorological student learning experiences.  Highly motivational learning
              experiences are designed to encourage students to consider additional study in
              the geosciences leading to scientific or Earth science teaching careers.
