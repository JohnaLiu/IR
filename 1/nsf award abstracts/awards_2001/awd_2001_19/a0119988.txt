This award provides support for one year of funding to
              construct and operate a biospectrologger (BSL) in a borehole in polar ice. 
              Such an optical device has already been developed and tested for measuring dust
              in polar ice.  The same general principle can be exploited to study microbes
              and biomolocules as a function of depth in glacial ice.  Microbes adapted to
              oligotrophic, low-temperature environments are found in glacial ice, frigid
              lakes, in permafrost and in cold, deep ocean water and sediments.  Polar ice
              contains the lowest concentrations, from a few hundred to about 104 cells/cm3,
              probably transported by wind into the atmosphere, precipitated with snow, and
              compacted into ice.  The great majority are dormant or dead.  With varying
              success, cultivation of microbes recovered from ice cores yields colony-forming
              units in a fraction (~10-4 to ~10-2 ) of dormant cells.  Chemical, physical and
              biological arguments indicate that as many as 103 microbes/cm3 can extract
              enough energy from acids confined in narrow liquid veins in otherwise solid ice
              to survive for a few thousand years (or a smaller population for a
              correspondingly longer time).  No search has yet been carried out for living
              bacteria in liquid veins.  The biospectrologger will be field tested at Siple
              Dome, Antarctica during the 2001/02 field season as part of an existing
              borehole logging program there.
