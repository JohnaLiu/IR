Abstract    :
              This proposal is to build the institutional capactiy and partnerships needed to
              develop a full center for teaching and learning at West Virginia University.  A
              full center as it is envisioned will focus on issues of importance for teaching
              science and mathematics in rural settings.  These issues include aspects of
              geography, the importance of indigenous knowledge, infrastructure needs and
              limited financial resources.  The center will also focus on ways to integrate
              and coordinate the various sciences, mathematics and technology content areas
              at the middle and high school levels, both within and across subject areas. 
              During this developmental project a study group will be formed to assess the
              needs at each of eight regional math and science consortia (RMSCs) and another
              set of study groups will be formed to study issues of  concern to the project. 
              These include research on learning and teaching in rural settings,
              characterizing indigenous knowledge, ways to provide learning support to
              students with special needs, legislative and industrial support, barriers to
              implementation, professional development programs and interdisciplinary math
              and science content.
