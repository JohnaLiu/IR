The Pls propose to hold a Gordon Research Conference on
              the Interior of the Earth from June 10-15, 2001 at Mount Holyoke College in
              South Hadley, Massachusetts.  As discussed in detail in the proposal, the
              conference is being held to bring together an interdisciplinary group of
              experts to discuss major unanswered questions about the composition, structure
              and dynamics of the Earth's interior.  Funds will be used to cover travel and
              accommodations to enhance participation of student and early-career scientists.
               It is expected that a broad and interdisciplinary cross-section of researchers
              from academia, government labs, and the broad international community will
              participate in the conference.
