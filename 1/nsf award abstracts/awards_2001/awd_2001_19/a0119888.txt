Invasive organisms pose serious threats to ecological and
              socioeconomic systems but in many cases can be controlled or at least managed
              through the use of an integrated analysis designed to consider the network of
              complex interactions among natural, economic, political, and cultural systems. 
              In this research, the investigators examine the coupled natural and human
              system controlling the dispersion of the glassy winged sharpshooter, an insect
              carrying the deadly bacterial Pierce's Disease currently infesting Californian
              wine-producing regions.  The project goals are to:  (1) conduct a workshop in
              which an international group of experts will gather to discuss factors
              controlling the organism's dispersal, and (2) based on these discussions,
              develop a proof-of-concept model to simulate sharpshooter dispersal.  The final
              product will be a modeling framework with which to test the effect of policy
              decisions on organism dispersal.  This approach, focused here on the
              sharpshooter, is designed to be applicable to invasive organism in general.
