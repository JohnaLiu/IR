Abstract    :
              The Oklahoma Teacher Education Collaborative (O-TEC) has developed a systemic
              approach to the recruitment, training, and retention of science and mathematics
              teachers in Oklahoma. In this follow-on project, a long term summative
              evaluation is being conducted that is 1) documenting the effectiveness of the
              original grant activities, and 2) contributing to the CORE evaluation project
              that is serving all projects funded in the NSF Collaboratives for Excellence in
              Teacher Preparation Program. The evaluation is guided by the CORE research
              questions and use instruments and protocols developed by that project. As
              triangulation, the evaluation is employing several tests and measures specific
              to Oklahoma students that have been part of previous evaluations and are
              closely associated with educational advancement and curriculum reform. Four
              higher education institutions will sevre as evaluation sites to facilitate data
              collection.
