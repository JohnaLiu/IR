This award provides partial support to complete development
              of technology necessary for measuring the abundance of two rare krypton
              isotopes, Kr-81 and Kr-85.  These isotopes, whose concentration in the
              atmosphere is stable and known, are potentially ideal tracers for a variety of
              environmental studies.  Kr-81, with a 229,000 year half-life, can determine how
              long ancient ice or ground water has been isolated from the atmosphere in the
              20,000 to 1,000,000 year time range.  Similarly, Kr-85, with its 10.8 year
              half-life, can determine isolation times in the 1 to 50 year time range.  These
              type of measurements can, for instance, provide important insight into the
              movement of groundwater, identify pathways for pollution infiltration, and
              provide input to overall resource management.  Being chemically inert, it is
              anticipated that the krypton isotopes will provide more reliable results than
              other, chemically active tracers, by eliminating the complexity of interactions
              with the underground environment.  The work sponsored by this grant includes
              completion of the necessary improvements to existing instrumentation, and
              application of the technique to several important groundwater problems to
              highlight its utility.
