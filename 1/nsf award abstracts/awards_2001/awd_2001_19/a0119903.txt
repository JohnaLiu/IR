The objective of the proposed research is to focus on the
              measurement of the emission and transport of biological aerosols (focusing on
              pollens) in the atmosphere.  Several instruments that cover the size range of
              microns for the particles themselves to particulate dispersal over many
              kilometers will be developed.  The behavior of individual pollen particles and
              the emission of pollen from the plant will be observed and modeled.  At the
              larger scales, particulate dispersal will be studied in a wind tunnel and in
              field studies, and the experimental results will be used to refine large eddy
              simulation models.  The field studies will be carried out at four sites in the
              Chesapeake Bay region.  Pollen transport is of interest because of species
              cross-fertilization and genetic diversity concerns that have arisen due to
              human disruption of the natural landscape, as well as concerns about transport
              distances of genetically altered pollens.
