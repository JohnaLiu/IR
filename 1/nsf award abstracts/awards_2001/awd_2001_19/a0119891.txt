              ABSTRACT

THE CSULB GEOSCIENCE DIVERSITY ENHANCEMENT
              PROGRAM
(G-DEP)

Underrepresentation of minorities in the geosciences is a
              recognized problem, and little is known about the specific cause of or
              solutions to the problem.  The California Sate University, Long Beach (CSULB)
              Departments of Geological Sciences, Geography, Archaeology, Anthropology, and
              the Environmental Sciences and Policy degree program proposes to created an
              innovative, collaborative partnership with several community colleges and local
              high schools to improve the research and educational experiences of
              underrepresented students in the geoscience disciplines.

The G-DEP model
              leverages the resources arising from of CSULB's involvement in the Long Beach
              Educational Partnership.  In addition, G-DEP builds on interdisciplinary
              activities among CSULB's Geography, Geology, Archeology, Anthropology and
              Environmental Science disciplines to create a working prototype for a
              comprehensive, integrated Earth Sciences program.  Underrepresented students
              will be encouraged to learn science by actively participating in geoscience
              research.  They will be more adequately prepared to become undergraduates, and
              more sufficiently supported as they matriculate.  With a firm commitment to
              dissemination of lessons learned, G-DEP will advance the literature on models
              that promote participation for underrepresented groups in geoscience research
              and education, particularly for the comprehensive, urban university.
