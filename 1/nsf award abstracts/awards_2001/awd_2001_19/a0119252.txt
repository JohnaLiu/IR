Abstract    :
              The award provides support for a two-day workshop on the plant hormone cytokinin
              to be attended primarily by U.S. and Czech scientists. The workshop will be
              held in Prague on June 28 and 29, prior to the meeting of the International
              Plant Growth Substances Association (IPGSA) in Brno, to maximize participation.
              The objective is to enhance existing and initiate new collaboration,
              particularly between junior faculty, postdoctoral students, and graduate
              students, with the goal of extending research partnership to the next
              generation of scientists. The funds will be used for organization of the
              workshop and for travel of young scientists (faculty, postdoctorals, and
              graduate students) to the workshop and the IPGSA meeting. The program will
              include reviews of recent advances in cytokinin research and discussions of
              future opportunities. Recent findings in selected areas will be introduced by
              lead scientists, followed by round-table discussions and small group sessions.
              The subjects will include: (1) biosynthetic and metabolic pathways; (2)
              receptors and signal transduction pathways; (3) genomics and proteomics; (4)
              genetic and functional analyses including mutants, knock-outs and transgenics;
              (5) methods and significance of cytokinin quantitation; (6) antibodies and
              immunology; and (7) regulation of cytokinin levels and physiological
              significance. This workshop should promote innovative research through
              collaborations between U.S. and Czech laboratories.
