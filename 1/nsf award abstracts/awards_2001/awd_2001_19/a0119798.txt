Abstract    :
              This workshop brings together a range of researchers, including graduate
              students and junior faculty, from a variety of natural and social science
              disciplines to understand the Human Dimensions of the Arctic System (HARC). 
              The close linkages between people and the environment, the great variability in
              both human and natural systems, and predictions that the polar regions will
              experience large impacts of global change make the Arctic a compelling region
              for research in to the dynamics of coupled natural and human systems.  The
              workshop will include strong participation from the Arctic indigenous
              community.  Research partnerships between disciplines and among researchers and
              indigenous representatives will be fostered by the opportunity to discuss
              pressing environmental, social, and cultural concerns.  This project is an
              award emanating from the FY 2001 special competition in Biocomplexity in the
              Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems.
