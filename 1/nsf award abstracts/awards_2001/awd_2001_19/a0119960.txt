Abstract    :
              Due to the sensitivity of ecosystems at the land-water interface and our
              dependence on them, it is increasingly imperative that we understand how they
              function and manage them wisely. This will require the combined efforts of
              physical, social and natural scientists, mathematicians, and modelers. Yet
              graduate students are not trained to interact across these disciplines. To add
              breadth to graduate training, this project will bring together established
              leaders in the social and natural sciences and recent graduates to design a
              capstone educational program. The objective of the educational program is to
              better prepare graduates for interdisciplinary careers dedicated to
              understanding, prediction and management of environments and resources at the
              land-water interface. The recommendations of the assembled group will be used
              to develop a model program to enhance interdisciplinary understanding,
              leadership training and networking.
