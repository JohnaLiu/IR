Title:   Culturally Situated Tools

This award provides support
              for Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) to develop culturally-situated
              design tools to motivate ethnic minority students to learn mathematics and to
              pursue careers in Information Technology.  The tools will be integrated into
              standard curricula for use by approximately one thousand middle school students
              in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's local GEAR-UP program (the U.S.
              Department of Education's Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for
              Undergraduate Program).  The use of the design tools will be evaluated over a
              3-year period and the results will be disseminated widely.
