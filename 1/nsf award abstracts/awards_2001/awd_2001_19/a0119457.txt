Abstract    :
              This action funds a one-year renewal for support of the US Committees for the
              bioscience unions that are part of the  International Council for Science
              (ICSU) and  administered through the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

The
              U.S. biology community is represented by NAS in five international scientific
              unions:  the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS),  the
              International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS), the International Union
              of Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB), the International Union of
              Microbiological Sciences (IUMS),  and the International Union of Biochemistry
              and Molecular Biology (IUBMB).  There are two overarching issues to which the
              five committees of U.S. scientists who represent U.S. interests in these
              international organizations have assigned high priority.  The first is the need
              for new, inclusive, multidisciplinary, and integrative approaches to biological
              questions.  The second is the need to build human and research capacity in
              developing countries.  This award will permit the NAS to continue to manage
              U.S. participation and assert U.S. leadership in these bioscience unions. 
              Further it provides dues have to the five international organizations and funds
              to support the activities of the five corresponding U.S. National Committees. 
              This award will also fund a new US National Committee for DIVERSITAS, an
              international cooperative research program on biological diversity under the
              sponsorship of the IUBS.
