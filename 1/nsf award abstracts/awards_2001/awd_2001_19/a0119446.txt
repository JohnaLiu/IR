Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for student participation at the upcoming 2001 OSA
              sponsored conference on the Applications of High Field and Short Wavelength
              Sources, to be held in Palm Springs, CA, from 21-24 October, 2001.    The funds
              will be used to waive graduate student registration fees and will aid in
