John K. Brown, Liberal Studies and the
              Integrated Engineering Education of ABET 2000: A Planning Conference at the
              University of Virginia


Under the impetus of new accrediting guidelines and
              goals (EC 2000), America's engineering colleges are poised to embark on
              far-reaching curricular innovation, responding especially to the new standards'
              insistence on integration across the curriculum and their determination to
              merge technical and humanistic studies. But the difficult work has barely
              begun: How will educators translate the inspired goals of EC 2000 into
              integrated courses, holistic design experiences, and comprehensive degree
              programs? In particular, how can liberal studies educators take a leadership
              role in fostering a truly integrated education for undergraduate
              engineers?

With a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), this project
              involves a planning conference that explores specific obstacles, goals, and
              models in achieving this curricular revolution. The holistic approach of EC
              2000 builds upon some highly useful precedents in integrative education
              developed at a range of engineering schools, some well known and others that
              have worked largely in isolation. The conference takes these scattered reform
              efforts, develops new concepts for integrative education, and traces out their
              benefits, limits, and adaptability to other institutions and contexts. The
              gathering draws upon the expertise of leaders from five groups with a vital
              interest in engineering education today: engineering school deans, faculty from
              the technical disciplines of engineering, liberal studies educators, engineers
              and managers employed in industry and government, and historians of technology.
              Each group has a vital stake in assuring the success of EC 2000, while each
              comes to the table with unique perspectives necessary in forging realistic
              plans to achieve that success.

This project is intended as the first step in
              laying out the parameters and approaches for a broader effort to provide
              information and guidance for engineering and liberal studies and spocialscience
              faculty seeking to integrate the techical and non-technical elements of 
              engineering curricula and educational experiences.
