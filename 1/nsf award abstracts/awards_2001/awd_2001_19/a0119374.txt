Abstract    :
              The project will take aerial photographs of the same terrain photographed
              approximately 50 years previously to examine changes in the environment,
              particularly the expansion of areas dominated by shrubs.  Shrub size, density,
              and extent will be compared between the old scenes and the new photographs to
              see if previous results from a pilot study are applicable to a wider area of
              the North Slope.  The northward expansion of shrubs is an expected response to
              climate warming and will have important implications for global change research
              in an area expected to experience the first impacts from global warming. 
              On-site measurements of vegetation indices (e.g. vegetation age, size,
              dimensions, composition, spacing, growth rates) will be used in comparison with
              temperature history to assess the impacts of warming climate on shrub
              growth/expansion in the region.
