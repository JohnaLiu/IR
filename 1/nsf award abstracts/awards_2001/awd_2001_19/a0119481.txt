The objective of this project will be to use LGDW to deliver
              vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-coated microspheres to
              undifferentiated multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) to induce the
              endothelial (blood vessel lining) cell phenotype locally.  The particle
              materials to be studied will include polystyrene and polylactic-glycolic acid
              with sizes ranging from 1-10 um. VEGF will be covalently immobilized to the
              particles via commercially available surface chemistry.
