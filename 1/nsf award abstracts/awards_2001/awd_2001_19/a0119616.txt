Abstract    :
              This project is investigating the thermodynamic properties associated with the
              growth of small aerosols (approximately 3-50 nm) in the laboratory as a
              function of composition, temperature and size.  At present, very little is
              known about very small particles that serve as the critical nuclei for
              nucleation and input for models of aerosol formation and growth in the
              atmosphere and large discrepancies exist between model predictions and field
              observations.  This work is expected to lead to a greater understanding of the
              Kelvin effect (particle surface-tension effect) on particle phase transitions
              and the new particle formation of pure aerosols.  During the final phase of the
              study, size-selected field samples will be collected and analyzed for
              comparison with the laboratory results.
