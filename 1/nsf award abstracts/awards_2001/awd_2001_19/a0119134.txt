              ABSTRACT

OCE-0119134


A researcher from Woods Hole Oceanographic
              Institution will participate in the cruises and field experiments of the
              Coastal Ocean Advances in Shelf Transport (COAST) project funded by the Coastal
              Oceans Processes (CoOP) program.  The participation of this PI in the study
              will add a phosphorus component to the project thereby allowing the coupled
              dynamics of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling in the coastal system off
              Oregon to be resolved.  Taking advantage of the high temporal and spatial
              resolution provided by the COAST sampling plan, the PI plans to carry out the
              following research:  (1) determine the 3-dimensional distributions of dissolved
              organic phosphorus (DOP) and particulate organic phosphorus (POP), and how they
              relate to distributions of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic
              carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), particulate organic nitrogen and
              other biological parameters; (2) ascertain the dynamic variability of the C:N:P
              ratios of the dissolved and particulate organic pools; (3) assess the short
              term (during transect re-sampling on each 21-day cruise) versus seasonal
              variations in coupled DOC, DON, DOP; and (4) evaluate the effects that
              topography has on DOP and POP cycling and cross-shelf transport.  In addition,
              DOP bioavailability will be evaluated by monitoring the extent of enzymatic DOP
              hydrolysis in field samples.  The nutritional status of in-situ phytoplankton
              with regard to phosphate stress will be determined by bulk and cell-specific
              Enzyme Labeled Fluorescence (ELF) Alkaline phosphatase (APase) and the
              species-specific response of phytoplankton to induced or alleviated
              P-limitation will be assessed using ELF-APase in shipboard nutrient amendment
              incubations.
