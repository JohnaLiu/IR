Abstract for NSF Proposal
              0119281

Request for Travel Grant for Graduate Students to Attend a
              Conference on the Structure and Mechanical Properties of Nanostructured
              Materials

This proposal requests funds to support 5 graduate students to
              attend a United Engineering Foundation Conference.  The title of the conference
              is Structure and Mechanical Properties of Nanostructured Materials:  Promoting
              a Synergy Among Computer Simulations, Experiments and Theory.    The students
              will be paired with an equal number of prominent senior attendees.  The
              graduate students will thus not only increase their professional and scientific
              education by attending an international conference on their thesis subject but
              also begin to network with leaders in their field. The scholarship offer would
              be limited to US citizens and permanent residents, and special consideration
              will be given to increase the diversity of the awardees to include women and
              underrepresented minorities.
