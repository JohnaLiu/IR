The goal of this proposal is to develop new tools that will
              ultimately allow in vivo sensing of multiple protease activity.  The project
              will focus on specific proteases prominently involved in angiogenesis,
              cancerogenesis, metastasis and which are being pursued as therapeutic drug
              targets, i.e., cathepsin B, cathepsin D and matrix metalloproteinase.  This
              newly developed technology may be applied to tumor detection, localization,
              metastatic characterization and evaluation of anti-tumor therapies.
