Abstract    :
              An advanced numerical cloud model will be used to simulate the types of storms
              observed in the Severe Thunderstorm Electrification and Precipitation Study
              (STEPS) of the summer of 2000.  The three-dimensional dynamic simulation model
              includes detailed microphysical, electrical, and lightning parameterizations
              and produces realistic storms and lightning in simulations of several types of
              thunderstorms.  Observations during STEPS were among the most complete ever
              taken for electrification studies.  They included polarimetric radar
              measurements, dual-Doppler measurements, three- dimensional lightning flash
              patterns obtained by the Lightning Mapping Array, in-situ cloud and electrical
              measurements obtained by instrumented balloons and a storm-penetrating
              aircraft, and surface observations from a mobile mesoscale network.  The data
              will be compared with simulations to improve the understanding of interactions
              among kinematics, precipitation production, and electrification in severe
              storms.  Examples of the topics to be investigated are (1) the influence of
              vertical air motions and precipitation on the production of lightning; (2) the
              influence of storm type (e.g., unicell, multicell, supercell) on flash rates
              and other lightning characteristics; (3) conditions attendant to the production
              of unusual lightning activity, such as exceptionally high flash rates or
              positive cloud-to-ground lightning.  It is expected that the research will lead
              to ways of using lightning data to help diagnose and forecast severe weather.
