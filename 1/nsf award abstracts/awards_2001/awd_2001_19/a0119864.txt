              ABSTRACT
SACNAS: Initiatives for Equity in the Geosciences

This project of
              the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science
              (SACNAS) seeks to recruit Native American and Chicano/Latino undergraduate
              students in the geosciences, environmental sciences, earth sciences, and
              astronomy each year for the next five years to attend and to participate in the
              SACNAS National Conference.  The project also supports a session at the annual
              SACNAS conference that will focus on advances in the geosciences.
              

Prospective student candidates are contacted and informed of the SACNAS
              initiative and offered financial assistance in the form of travel and lodging
              grants to attend the National Conference.  At the conference, students attend
              small group workshops, present research posters, participate in scientific
              symposia, and exchange ideas in meaningful one-on-one interactions with
              scientists, teachers, engineers, and professionals.  In an effort to theorize
              and measure the impact of outreach efforts SACNAS will add a tracking dimension
              to the model for purposes of demonstrating whether programmatic efforts impact
              student decisions to continue their education into graduate school and beyond. 
              The tracking system will survey students at the end of each academic year and
              after graduation across a number of educational variables and academic
              practices.  Ultimately, this project increases the representation of Native
              American and Chicano/Latino geoscience students and scientists within
              NSF-supported research and education
              initiatives.
