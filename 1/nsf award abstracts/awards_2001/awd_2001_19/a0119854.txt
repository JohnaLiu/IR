              ABSTRACT
Our Ocean: Enhancing Minority Education in the Marine Sciences at a
              Caribbean HBCU

The project is conducted by faculty in the Marine Sciences at
              the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI), a predominantly undergraduate,
              Historically Black university with campuses on the islands of St. Thomas and
              St. Croix. 
The project takes advantage of the strengths of UVI-the accessible
              tropical marine environment of the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean, high
              academic standards, and a strong track record of preparing minority
              undergraduates for postgraduate study in the sciences. The program works
              synergistically with other programs, including an NSF Historically Black
              Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program cooperative agreement
              (HRD-9979896) to address the education, economic, and cultural barriers to
              entry into the marine sciences that Virgin Islanders face. 

This project
              increases the number of minority Virgin Islanders entering into the marine
              sciences at the undergraduate and graduate levels by reducing educational,
              economic, and cultural barriers to entry and retention. Specific activities
              supporting this goal include: enhancing the interest and preparation in the
              marine sciences of minority high school students through a six-week, on-campus
              summer enrichment activity; increasing enrollment and retention in UVI's Marine
              Biology BS curriculum by providing one new 4-year tuition scholarship to a
              minority Virgin Island student each year for 3 years; strengthening preparation
              for post-baccalaureate study and/or careers in marine sciences by supporting
              mentored undergraduate research projects per semester for three years; and
              developing programs to increase awareness and interest in marine fields.
