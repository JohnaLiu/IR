The objective of the proposed research is to design,
              synthesize, and evaluate novel Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD) peptide-dye
              conjugates for optical imaging of tumor angiogenesis.  This will be
              accomplished by targeting integrin receptors which are overexpressed in
              malignant tumors.  The conjugation on near infrared carbocyanine dyes to
              integrin receptor-avid RGD peptides would yield novel tumor-specific optical
              contrast agents.  The bioconjugates will be evaluated in vitro to determine
              their receptor binding affinity, and in vivo to compare the efficacy of
              integrin receptor-specific and nonspecific optical contrast agents.  If
              successful, this research could develop new infrared fluorescent probes for
              cancer detection.
