Abstract    :
              Land-use continues to change throughout the world as economies and populations
              grow. Land-use change often has large adverse impacts on natural capital and
              the ecosystem services that this capital provides. The long-term goals of this
              project are 1) to improve understanding and prediction of land-use change and
              its effects on biocomplexity in watersheds, and 2) to improve the capacity of
              decision makers to use this information in their efforts to foster both
              economic well being and preservation of natural capital.  In this incubation
              activity, the investigators will work at the watershed scale toward integrated
              biophysical/economic systems models that respond to thresholds and episodic
              events.  This is a significant departure from the approach taken by much
              preceding work, in which information has been analyzed using regression
              relationships based on continuous functions that cannot handle threshold and
              episodic events. The investigators plan to hold three workshops for team
              development, assessment of the state of knowledge, and the articulation of the
              conceptual framework and methods for a larger and more in-depth study.
