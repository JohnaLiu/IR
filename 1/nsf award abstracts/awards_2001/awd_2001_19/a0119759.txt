Abstract    :
              Two interdisciplinary workshops will focus on ecological change and human
              impacts during the Holocene on the Aleutian Islands.  The Aleutian Islands
              represent a model ecosystem to track human-environment interactions over the
              past 10,000 years.  The Aleutians contain a 9,000-year record of human
              occupation. For most of the Holocene, the archipelago has formed the boundary
              between the North Pacific Rim and Bering Sea.  The region is a rich ecotone
              with ocean fisheries, large sea mammal populations, thick kelp forests, complex
              near-shore ecosystems and intertidal zones, spawning streams, and a highly
              diverse avian fauna.  The workshops will be used to (1) identify existing
              oceanographic, climatological, geophysical, and biological data that document
              complex environmental change in the Aleutians; (2) identify research areas and
              investigators needed to provide additional data necessary to reconstruct
              environmental change in the Aleutians; and (3) correlate existing data from the
              physical and biological sciences with the recorded history of human occupation
              of, and adaptation to, the island chain; and (4) design a research strategy to
              provide a more precise temporal framework for Holocene environmental change and
              concomitant human responses.  This project is an award emanating from the FY
              2001 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the
              Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems.
