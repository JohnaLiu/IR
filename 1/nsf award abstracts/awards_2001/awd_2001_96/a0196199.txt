This proposal is divided into three parts. The first one deals with a
              linkage problem closely  related to the search for ideals having
              Cohen--Macaulay blowup algebras.  The second one analyzes the comparison
              between the Cohen-Macaulayness of the Rees algebra and the one of its
              associated graded ring.  The methods used to understand this  relationship
              involve a deep study of the necessity of conditions on the reduction number,
              which in turn are equivalent to explicit formulas for the core of an ideal. 
              Whenever such conditions are satisfied, the PI would like to describe a set of
              defining equations of the Rees ring.  The last part of the proposal attempts to
              find numerical conditions that imply lower bounds on the depth of its
              associated graded ring.

This is a project in commutstive algebra that is
              motivated by algebraic geometry.  In general, by studying systems of equations
              and their structure one can learn more about geometry.  This topic is also
              suitable for introducing undergraduates to mainstream research.
