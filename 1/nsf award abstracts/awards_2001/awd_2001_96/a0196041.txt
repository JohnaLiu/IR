This research involves a variety of new data-analytic
              techniques for processing and modeling high dimensional data that arise from
              many scientific disciplines.  These range from varying-coefficient models from
              epidemiology and environmental statistics, time-inhomogeneous diffusion models
              from finance, curves and images data from ophthalmology, marketing and
              biostatistics, to wavelet applications in statistics and engineering.  The
              research enhances significantly the availability of tools and software for
              analyzing these complicated high-dimensional data.

The research covers a
              wide array of methodological developments and foundational research.  In
              particular, four inter-related topics are focussed.  Firstly, a two-step
              strategy is proposed for efficient estimation in varying-coefficient models. 
              This is particularly useful when coefficient functions admit different degrees
              of smoothness.  The proposed methods will be justified by carefully formulated
              asymptotic theory and simulations.  The proposed methods extends to
              longitudinal studies and likelihood-based models such as generalized linear
              models.  Secondly, time-inhomogeneous diffusion models are proposed to model
              term-structure dynamics and asset pricing.  These nonparametric models aim at
              addressing inadequacy of over simplified parametric models.   Various
              data-analytic modeling techniques are proposed and justified by both
              theoretical studies and empirical research.  Thirdly, wavelet applications to a
              variety of statistical problems are discussed.  The proposed approaches derive
              from statistical modeling prospective and are based on penalized likelihood
              idea.  Our aim is to expand the applicability of wavelets in statistics and to
              improve efficiency of some existing techniques.  In particular, likelihood
              based models, robustness, denoising correlated data and additive modeling are
              proposed for investigation.  Finally, some statistical inference problems
              arising from processing curves and images data are investigated.
