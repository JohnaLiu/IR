The primary questions of this study will address are: 
              what are the scale lengths of topography on the 410 and 660 km discontinuity? 
              And how much does scattering induced by this topography bias estimates of the
              topography, amplitude, and sharpness of these discontinuities?  Also, when
              topographic scattering is minimal, what are the details of the velocity
              profiles across the 410 and 660?  As a pilot study, 46,000 radial and
              tangential receiver functions from the most data-rich global stations were
              made.  To search for lateral variations, the converted S-wave piercing points
              at each station are binned into 40 km square patches at the 410 and 660, with
              only bins with more than twenty high quality receiver functions being studied. 
              The effects of discontinuity topography scattering will be studied by analyzing
              the effects of varying the bin size and frequency content.  Preliminary
              analyses indicate that up to 60 km of topography on the 410 and 660 km
              discontinuity can be found.
