Abstract    :
              This project will develop prototype quantitative indicators that measure access
              to information technologies (IT) in the United States.  These indicators will
              measure access to IT in terms of point of access (i.e., work, home, and
              libraries), demographics (i.e., income, education, race and ethnicity), and
              technological capability (i.e., computer and modem speed, internet access,
              software and media).  The PI will utilize data from government, commercial, and
              non-profit sources.  These indicators will help in the evaluation of the
              so-called "digital divide"--the social and economic disadvantages of lacking
              access to information in a knowledge-based economy.  These indicators are of
              particular significance to the National Science Board, the Divsion of Science
              Resources Studies, the broader U. S. policy community, and scholars.  The
              project will aim to synthesize the theory and empirical evidence regarding the
              impacts of information inequalities on information and society, develop
              prototype indicators of IT equity in the United States, and evaluate the
              potential for an IT equity indicators program.  The key expected outcomes are a
              set of prototype IT equity indicators and detailed instructions about the
              construction of the measures, the data available to calculate the measures, and
              the institutional and data collection requirements for an on-going effort in
              this area.
