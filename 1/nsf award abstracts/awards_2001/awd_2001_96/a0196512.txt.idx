Abstract    :
              9971922 Phillips       An important set of problems in the analysis of the
              thermophysical properties of materials  surround the question of how to base
              this analysis on an understanding of the underlying defect mechanisms taking
              place within a material.  For example, in the context of plastic deformation,
              though it is well known that plasticity is often mediated by the motion of
              dislocations, as yet, the goal of constructing models of plasticity based
              directly on the physics of dislocations has been largely unfulfilled.  Part of
              the reason for this is the operation in problems of this sort of multiple
              length and time scales.  The work proposed  here has two key thrusts: 1) the
              development of new computational tools for the investigation of problems
              involving a hierarchy of length and time scales and 2) the application of these
              hierarchical tools to the analysis of the nucleation, motion and interaction of
              dislocations.  Our methodological work will center on the extension of the
              quasicontinuum method to three-dimensions with a full capability for carrying
              out dynamical simulations at finite temperature and including both mesh
              refinement and mesh coarsening.  The application of these ideas to the physics
              of dislocations will include an analysis of the kinetics of dislocation motion
              and the strength of junctions
