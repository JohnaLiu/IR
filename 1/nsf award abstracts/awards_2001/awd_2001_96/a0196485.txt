Abstract    :
              Optimization is the process of finding the smallest (or largest) value that a
              function can return. The demand for advanced optimization software tools is
              increasing sharply as the importance of optimization methodology in
              engineering, basic science, and finance is becoming more widely recognized. The
              dramatic increase in computing power, and the improvements in supporting
              technologies such as modeling languages and automatic differentiation, are
              fueling demand for optimization codes. These codes must solve more and more
              computationally challenging problems, including integer programming and
              nonlinear optimization problems.

This project will develop new algorithms
              and advanced software for large-scale nonlinear, nonconvex constrained
              optimization, with special emphasis on interior-point methods. Specific goals
              include (1) fundamental research on interior-point methods that have appealing
              convergence properties and robust behavior; (2) development of modern software
              that is well suited to implementation on advanced computing platforms and
              interoperable with relevant high-performance software; (3) integration of
              interfaces to modeling languages and automatic differentiation tools; and (4)
              free distribution of the software to the manufacturing, engineering, and
              scientific community through the NEOS web site.
