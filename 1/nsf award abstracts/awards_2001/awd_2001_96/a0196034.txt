Abstract    :
              9971794
     The goal of the research funded by this Small Grant for
              Exploratory Research is to examine multi-criteria decision making in the
              broadest context of engineering design, including both product/process/service
              and organization design for their realization.  This research builds upon
              Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, which essentially states that all multi-criteria
              decision making approaches are flawed.  The first objective will be to explore
              and, if possible, develop a theory of decision making that will minimize flaws
              causing worrisome decisions.  The second objective will be to view
              organizational design also as a decision-making process and to apply the
              multi-criteria decision-making principles to this as well.
     If successful,
              this research will provide insights into the flaws present in most extant
              approaches to engineering design decision making, and it will lead to methods
              for the minimization of the impacts of such flaws.  These decisions affect
              nearly a trillion dollars worth of American enterprise, and even small
              improvements will have enormous economic benefit.
