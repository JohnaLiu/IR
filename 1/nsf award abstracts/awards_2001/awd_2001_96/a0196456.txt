The proposed research focuses on the development of
              analysis methods and tools that increase the fault-tolerance and security of
              distributed software by helping programmers to debug, systematically test, and
              (when feasible) verify such software. Verification techniques based on
              state-space exploration apply directly only to finite-state systems.  However,
              many distributed software systems have unbounded parameters (e.g., the number
              of client processes).  The proposed research develops reductions that exploit
              partial independence between regions of the state space, so that verification
              of a finite-state system yields conclusions about the original unbounded
              system.  Most state-space exploration tools force the user to construct and
              analyze simplified models of software.  The proposed tool aims to analyze
              programs written in general-purpose languages, such as Java.  The tool's basic
              design follows that of VeriSoft: state-space exploration is performed without
              storing the set of visited states, with optimizations to reduce the redundant
              computation (multiple visits to a state) that this may cause.  The proposed
              research extends this approach to handle systems that use cryptography. 
              Software used in undergraduate and graduate operating systems courses will be
              enhanced with the form of state-space exploration just described, providing
              students with powerful support for finding synchronization errors and other
              bugs.
