The Sino-Korean craton is a rare example of an Archean craton
              that shows
evidence for loss of its refractory mantle root.  In the
              Paleozoic,
diamondiferous kimberlites erupted through the craton carrying
              minerals and
xenoliths indicative of the presence of a 200 km thick
              refractory
lithosphere, equilibrated to a cool geotherm.  In the Triassic,
              refractory
garnet peridotite was uplifted in the Sulu region during the
              collision of
the Yangtze and Sino-Korean cratons.  These peridotites may
              indicate the
presence of the cratonic root at this time.  In contrast,
              Cenozoic
rift-related basalts carry fertile mantle xenoliths that record
              high
equilibration temperatures and sample to depths of only 80 km. 
              These
observations have been interpreted to reflect the loss of the cratonic
              root
beneath the Sino-Korean craton, sometime after the Ordovician and
              it's
replacement with more fertile peridotite, typical of off-craton
              regions.
Outstanding questions include: 1) whether all of the cratonic mantle
              was
removed, 2) when it was removed and 3) the mechanism by which it
              was
removed.  We seek to address these questions through a
              systematic
petrographic, geochemical and Re-Os isotopic study of the three
              types of
mantle samples described above.  Re-Os analyses of chromites from the
              Sulu
peridotites and whole rocks from the basalt-borne peridotites will be
              made
in order to determine 1) the origin and age of the tectonic slivers and
              2)
when the present lithosphere (as sampled by the Cenozoic basalts)
              formed.
These dates will allow us to estimate the timing of lithosphere
              removal,
assuming that it must have occurred shortly before the present
              lithosphere
formed.  Given this, it may be possible to infer the mechanism of
              removal
of the cratonic lithosphere.
