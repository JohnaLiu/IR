Abstract    :
              9704644  Ruoff    This    research    project   emphasizes   the   synthesis   
              and  characterization  of  the  chemical and  physical  properties  of 
              periodic  arrays  of  carbon   and metal  carbide  nanotubes  and  nanorods. 
              This is the first time these types of arrays have been  synthesized and
              chararcterized. The nanotube arrays will be grown  from  a  periodic  array of
              catalytic metal  particles  of  well-  defined  sizes  arranged  in  a 
              predetermined  spatial  pattern.  Properties  such  as  mechanical strength, 
              field  emission,  and  chemical reactivity will be determined, and nanotube
              arrays  will  be  studied  with  matrix materials such as  polymer,  metal,  or
               ceramic. A significant understanding of the nucleation and growth  of very
              small diameter carbon nanofibers  and filaments will also  be obtained.  %%% 
              Basic knowledge regarding  the fundamental synthesis of nanotubes  and  
              nanoarrays,  together  with  their  chemical  and  physical  properties,
              underpins several focused areas of high technological  interest  to  industry. 
              These include high thermal  conductivity  carbon  fiber  / carbon matrix
              composites, vacuum microelectronic  devices, fiber-reinforced composites, novel
              membrane and catalyst  materials, and new magnetic materials for high-density 
              recording  media.   This  project is supported under an initiative  entitled 
              Grant  Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry  (GOALI),  and it is
              funded by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of  the  Directorate for
              Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and  the  Solid  State  Chemistry and
              Polymers Program of the  Division  of  Materials Research.  ***
