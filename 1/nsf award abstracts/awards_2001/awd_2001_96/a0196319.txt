              Faculty Fellows Program. The award to Dr. Margaret M. Carreiro is to establish
              a research and education program in the area of the ecology of natural
              ecosystems embedded in urban and suburban landscapes. Dr. Carreiro will mentor
              and guide the research of a postdoctoral fellow, two graduate students, one
              undergraduate student, and two high school students over the five-year period
              of this award. She also will develop a course in urban and suburban ecology at
              Fordham University.
