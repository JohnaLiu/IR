Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    Cristian Popescu  University of Texas at Austin  98 01267   
              Professor Popescu will study connections between Stark's conjecture for
              L-functions and the construction of Euler systems.  The investigator will study
              the functorial behavior of the conjectures concerning  higher order of
              vanishing,  looking for refined versions of these conjectures, and consider
              their connections with Euler systems.      One of the most important
              mathematical ideas of the second half of the century, is that analytic formula 
              often encodes discrete information. For example, one might want to count the
              number of solutions of a particular equation, but discover that the solutions
              are very hard to find. On the other hand, you might want to count the number of
              solutions to a sequence of equations and have the answers as a sequence.
              Mathematicians call these kind of problems 'discrete'. The functions that
              appear in calculus, and for which calculus works so well, are not 'discrete',
              but 'analytic.'  Amazingly, the right kind of analytic function can contain the
              answer or answers to the discrete examples about.  This project involves
              L-functions which were among the first examples of this kind of analytic
              function.  In the past thirty years, a number of people including H. Stark have
              found new ways L-functions encode discrete information. Because many of these
              connections are still only conjecture, L-functions are very important in
              current mathematics.
