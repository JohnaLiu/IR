Abstract    :
              Professor Krishnan Balasubramanian at the Department of Chemistry and
              Biochemistry, Arizona State University, is supported by a grant from the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform relativistic quantum
              chemical studies of semiconductor clusters.  The systems being studied include
              Group III, IV, and V clusters as well as species involved in gallium nitride
              chemical vapor deposition.  Electron correlation and relativistic effects are
              explicitly treated in order to obtain accurate energetic, geometric, and
              spectroscopic properties for these heavy-atom systems. 

The work under this
              grant is directed toward resolving questions about a wide range of properties
              of semiconductor and main group clusters containing heavy atoms.  Clusters
              constitute a vital bridge between molecules and solids. However, they also
              exhibit interesting and technologically useful properties in their own right. 
              In this project, the systems studied have relevance for semiconductor
              processing and for chemical vapor deposition.
