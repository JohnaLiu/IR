Abstract    :
              The first cellular step in vision is phototransduction, when light energy is
              captured by molecular mechanisms that finally lead to a nerve signal to the
              brain.  A cascade of biochemical reactions occurs in the photoreceptor cell,
              and one of the key steps is the activation  of a class of proteins called
              G-proteins.  The activation occurs by phosphorylation, the addition of a
              phosphate group to the protein; subsequent deactivation involves
              dephosphorylation.  One of the proteins regulating the rate and amount of
              phosphorylation is called arrestin.  While much research has studied the
              activation of the light signal, few have worked on the way the signal is turned
              off, and that is the focus here.  This collaborative project combines
              approaches from molecular biology, biochemistry and cellular physiology to
              investigate the up- and down-regulation of G-protein linked membrane receptor
              molecules.  The system used is the photoreceptor of the horseshoe crab,
              Limulus, which has been a model for invertebrate photoreception for decades and
              also provides excellent comparisons to our knowledge of vertebrate
              phototransduction.    Results from this work will add critical understanding
              about regulation of visual processes, and have an impact extending beyond
              photoreception and vision to signal transduction in cell communication and to
              cellular biology in general.
