              Algorithms for Automating the Animation of Human Motion    (This award supports
              CES associate Nancy Pollard.)  Realistic simulation of human motion remains an
              elusive goal.  Although recent systems have demonstrated dynamic tasks such as
              running, cycling, diving, and vaulting, one specific flaw in most current
              systems is that they cannot automatically adapt to changes in the simulated
              scenario.    The goal of this work is to develop efficient parallel algorithms
              for adapting biomechanical simulations of human motion to changes in task
              conditions and to changes in the size and proportions of a moving character. 
              This research will develop scaling laws and search procedures to automate
              adaptation of simulations to a range of situations.  The search techniques will
              be computationally intensive due to the complexity of modeling and simulating
              human motion.  As one means of addressing this complexity, parallel search
              algorithms will be implemented and tested on different hardware configurations
              to gain insight into the effectiveness of various architectures for creating
              realistic simulations.  This research should contribute necessary data for the
              development of low-cost parallel architectures that will make sophisticated
              human simulation capabilities widely available to animators and researchers in
              fields ranging from biomechanics and ergonomics to education and entertainment.
