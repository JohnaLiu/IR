Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT - Koylu        This is a study of soot formation in laminar flames that
              are forced by a controlled time-varying flow field.  A counterflow burner is
              used with a loudspeaker on each side to impose unsteady strain rates on the
              flames.  Measurements are made on steady and unsteady flames including volume
              fraction of translucent and mature soot particles, particle/aggregate sizes,
              soot morphology, particle velocity, flame temperature, molecular fluorescence,
              and radiative losses.  Experimental techniques include laser scattering and
              extinction, thermophoretic sampling with examination by transmission electron
              microscopy, visible absorption spectroscopy, laser Doppler velocimetry,
              two-wavelength pyrometry, thermocouple measurements, laser-induced
              fluorescence, and total radiation heat flux.  Fuels used include methane,
              propane, propylene, and acetylene; strain rates are varied in the range of
              20-200 sec -1.  Computational predictions of soot and flame properties are made
              and compared to the experimental observations.    This is an attempt to bridge
              the gap between laminar (which is easily studied) and turbulent (reflecting
              practical systems) nonpremixed  combustion of hydrocarbon fuels.  The long-term
              goal is perfection of methods to control soot formation in a range of
              applications including internal combustion engines, gas turbines, and
              industrial furnaces.
