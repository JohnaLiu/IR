Abstract    :
              David Beratan is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational
              Chemistry Program to study response properties of   biomolecules including
              electron transfer reactions and Raman   spectroscopic probes of chirality.  The
              goal of the proposed work is to   develop a general new tool that will enable
              the theoretical exploration   of biochemical structure-function and reactivity
              relations by exploiting   the local nature of chemical interactions.  An ab
              initio   divide-and-conquer method is proposed, tailored to describe the  
              electronic and vibronic response properties of macromolecules.  The   methods
              will be developed in such a way that they can be used to: 1)   establish a link
              between 3D structure and electron transfer rates in   proteins and DNA; 2) 
              assist in relating molecular structure to   chiroptical properties critical for
              drug discovery and protein structure   determination, and 3) expand the
              structure-property interpretations of   proteins available via Raman
              spectroscopy.  The actual implementation of   this strategy involves the use of
              an effective Hamiltonian, and Greens   function theory to determine the
              relevant response function.  A quantitative molecular-level description of
              biological function will   arise from a detailed description of macromolecular
              electronic and   vibronic structure.  Yet, reliable electronic structure
              calculations are   possible on systems of only modest size.  Beratan's research
              program will   enable the theoretical exploration of biochemical
              structure-function and   reactivity relations at the molecular level for
              macromolecular systems of   biological interest.
