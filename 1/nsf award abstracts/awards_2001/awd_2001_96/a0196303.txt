Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a collaborative effort between  Utah State
              University and Pennsylvania State University for the development of innovative
              curriculum in the areas of distributed collaborative manufacturing, including
              Internet based collaboration and remote manufacturing. A new course is proposed
              for graduate students in manufacturing engineering curriculum programs.  In
              addition, modules related to these topics will be introduced in senior level
              manufacturing engineering courses for students in mechanical and industrial
              engineering programs.  This course is a needed addition to existing
              manufacturing courses as it deals with a subject area that has been
              revolutionizing the entire manufacturing community worldwide.  A changing
              global manufacturing environment necessitates that engineering institutions
              educate their students in the associated new concepts/principles and help them
              acquire skills which will enable them to adapt to their changing manufacutring
              work environments. Students at Utah State and Penn State will work on
              inter-university collaborative class projects under the framework of an
              innovative 'Collaboratory'.  Multi-media course modules, interactive learning
              modules and internet based projects will be designed and implemented.
