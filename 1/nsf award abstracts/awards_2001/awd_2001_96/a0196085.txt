Abstract    :
              The investigators propose to continue an atmospheric sampling program that was
              initiated in winter 
1997-98 with a pilot program at 10,600 feet altitude at
              the summit of the Greenland Ice Cap. The 1997-98 pilot project was the first
              attempt to measure atmospheric chemistry during the winter season and the first
              attempt by NSF to support a science team at the Summit station during winter
              conditions.  The scientific success of the pilot project and the logistics
              lessons learned prove that the proposed continuation of a winterover sampling
              program is a viable method for determining the variables that control the
              transfer of the atmospheric chemistry into the ice core record. The calibration
              of the atmospheric chemical record with the snowfall record will be used to
              determine how the atmospheric record is transferred into the ice record.  The
              ultimate goal is to interpret the past atmospheric chemistry using samples of
              the Greenland Ice Sheet Two (GISP2) project ice core that was collected
              previously at the site. The100,000 year annual record of the GISP2 ice core
              will provide the opportunity to examine the record of atmospheric changes from
              both natural and anthropogenic causes.
