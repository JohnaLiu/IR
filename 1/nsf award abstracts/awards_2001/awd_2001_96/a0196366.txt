Abstract    :
              This project combines research developments in computational  geometry and
              biology.  Accurate and robust methods have been  developed for computing shapes
              and topologies of macromolecules.  Complex computational methods have been
              developed for studying  molecular recognition and rational drug design. 
              Geometric tools  have been applied to compute areas, volumes, cavities, and 
              interfaces in proteins with a high degree of success.    The goal now is to
              accomplish the important step of modeling and  rapidly computing the shape of
              binding pockets.  This approach is  novel and based on a recent theoretical
              breakthrough in the  geometric modeling of shape and complementary space.  The 
              geometric methods will be combined with newly possible methods  for computing
              interaction energetics between proteins and  substrates.  The primary focus is
              on providing accurate and  efficient computational tools for the rational
              exploration of  substrate and drug binding pockets in proteins, and aiding 
              rational drug design.
