This grant will provide partial support for the acquisition
              of a new design of dilution refrigerator that uses a pair of
              computer-controlled sorption pumps to achieve millikelvin temperatures with
              reasonable cooling power (> 50m W at 100mK), without the use of external
              mechanical pumps to circulate the 3He/4He mixture.  This novel design offers
              greatly simplified operation, and the possibility of significantly reduced
              vibrational heating.  Both of these features are important to the research and
              educational programs in our laboratory, as described below.  The best-supported
              and most reliable version of this new design includes a vapor shielded dewar,
              10/12 T superconducting magnet, gas handling, and control electronics.  Two new
              research projects will benefit directly from the new dilution refrigerator. 
              (1) Adiabatic Quantum Pumping of Charge; and (2) Nanoscale
              Electroplating.

The dilution refrigerator will be located in the expanded
              laboratory facilities in the Laboratory for Advanced Materials to assure that
              both graduate and undergraduate students have an opportunity to run their own
              experiment.  "Run" in this sense typically means fabricate their own samples,
              usually using the NSF Stanford Notification Facility-several undergraduates
              from our lab in fact now have user grants in this facility-carry out the
              low-temperature measurements, analyze the data, compare to theory, and write up
              a report, presumably for publication.

The equipment will significantly
              enhance the research capabilities and educational opportunities of faculty and
              students.
