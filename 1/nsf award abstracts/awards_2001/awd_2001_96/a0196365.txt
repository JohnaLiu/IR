This project deals with the design and development of
              parallel
algorithms, computation model, and runtime support tools for
              efficient
execution of multimedia applications on multithreaded
              computing
platforms. In particular, applications that employ
              irregular
computation structures and data dependent communication patterns
              are
studied and used as a vehicle to investigate algorithmic
              and
implementation issues related to multithreaded computing.  While
existing
              computation models lack in capturing the architectural and
computation
              characteristics of the multithreaded paradigms, a new
model is investigated to
              be used as a platform for algorithms'
development. Load adaptive parallel
              algorithms and implementations are
developed by taking advantage of the
              computation and communication
overlapping characteristics of the multithreaded
              computing
paradigm. The executions of the programs based on the
              proposed
algorithms are supported by dynamic schedulers and load
              balancers
designed as runtime support tools.  The application area focussed in
              
this  project consists of multimedia signal/image processing
applications,
              particularly those based on non-linear signal processing
techniques. This
              project has a wide-spread impact on real-time
multimedia processing tasks in
              defense, scientific and commercial
applications.
