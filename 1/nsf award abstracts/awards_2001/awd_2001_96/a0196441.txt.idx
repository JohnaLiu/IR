Abstract    :
              This award provides support for five years of funding to determine the mass
              balance and accumulation rate of  ice along the traverse routes of the U.S.
              International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition (US ITASE) program.  The
              rate of ice sheet thickening or thinning will be measured along flow lines,
              along ice divides and along elevation contours in West Antarctica using a
              method which measures the vertical velocities of markers buried in subsurface
              ice.  This method uses the Global Positioning System (GPS) and surveying
              techniques to determine the precise location of these markers.  Vertical
              velocities so obtained are compared with long-term rates of snow accumulation
              and the difference in the two is a measure of  ice sheet thickness change.  A
              series of recording instruments will be installed to provide continuous records
              of firn densification and snow surface elevation change.  These instruments
              will be deployed at selected sites to link transient changes in snow surface
              elevation, as measured by altimeters, to long-term rates of ice thickness
              change. Ice motion at drill sites, upglacier topography and upglacier gradients
              in accumulation rate will be measured and used to calculate ice flow-induced
              accumulation rate variations and remove them from the ice core records.  This
              work will provide the capability to deduce true past climatic variations in
              accumulation rate from the US ITASE ice core records.
