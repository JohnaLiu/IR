Abstract    :
              Engineering - Civil (54)  The pressures on undergraduate science, math,
              engineering, and technology (SME&T) education and the recommended actions to
              overcome these problems are well-documented. Miller and Cooper, in work at the
              University of Washington under the auspices of the Engineering Coalition of
              Schools for Excellence in Education and Leadership (ECSEL), have developed a
              multi-faceted suite of educational materials for engineering mechanics courses
              that incorporates many of these suggestions.   This project at Louisiana
              State University is: 1. adapting and implementing the University of Washington
              Mechanics of Materials educational suite  2. evaluating the effectiveness
              Miller and Cooper's various components 3. institutionalizing these materials
              to ensure sustainability 4. disseminating all findings and materials to the
              engineering education community  This project adds to Miller and Cooper's
              materials by introducing a wireless network of laptop computers into the
              classroom. Having computers distributed throughout the classroom affords
              greater flexibility in developing hands-on activities. Also, multimedia modules
              are modified and improved, hands-on activities are expanded, and student
              presentations are expanded to incorporate digital movie making. The results of
              these modifications and the effectiveness of the various components of Miller
              and Cooper's approach are being assessed by mixed mode (quantitative and
              qualitative) evaluation instruments developed in conjunction with this project.
