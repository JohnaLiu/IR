Abstract    :
                9730596  Iskandarani    The project is for numerical and theoretical study of
              the  role of gravity waves in the long-time evolution of the  global oceanic
              circulation.  The model used is SEOM  developed at Rutgers University, and an
              multiple-pressure-  variable approach will be implemented.  It would lead to an
               order-of-magnitude enhancement in the efficiency of SEOM,  thus allowing
              extended high-resolution ocean simulations  that include adequate
              representation of free-surface  phenomena.  The model will first be used for
              two-dimensional  simulations of tidal circulation in the global ocean.  After 
              the model is optimized, extended three-dimensional  simulations of the global
              wind-driven circulation will be  performed.
