Abstract    :
              The research explores techniques for the coordination and control  of dynamic
              systems, both natural and human-made.  Techniques will  be  developing that
              allow the development of robots and simulated  creatures  with  many degrees of
              freedom that can  control  their  actions in unpredictable environments.  In
              particular, algorithms  will be developed for dynamic error recovery in legged
              robots and  for the simulation of human motion.
