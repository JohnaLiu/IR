Abstract    :
              9720641 Martins  The "comparative method" is used throughout biology to uncover
              historical patterns across diverse groups of organisms. Today, it is widely
              accepted that any statistical analysis of comparative or interspecific data
              should be conducted in a phylogenetic context. Although several phylogenetic
              comparative methods (PCMs) have been developed for conducting such analyses,
              these methods suffer from a number of technical problems which make them
              difficult to apply.   In this project, Emilia Martins and colleagues will use
              computer simulation and theoretical development to correct several of the
              statistical difficulties involved in the application of PCMs. They will also
              continue development of a package of computer programs, COMPARE, which will
              make PCMs freely accessible to all biologists over the internet.  The primary
              goal of the education component of this project is to expose undergraduates to
              research. This will be done by 1) further developing our summer program for
              minority undergraduates in biology, 2) developing the use of the internet to
              allow undergraduates in my courses to interact with researchers from other
              campuses, and 3) expanding a course on phylogenetics to include a project in
              which the students collect and analyze data and prepare the results for
              publication in a scientific journal.
