Abstract    :
              To understand mathematical cognition both as it develops in the young child and
              as it is taught in school, one must understand the cognitive systems from which
              it is constructed and the processes by which those systems are coordinated to
              produce new concepts and skills.  Based on previous research, we hypothesize
              that elementary school mathematics builds on three representational systems:  a
              system for representing exact small numerosities, a system for representing
              approximate large numerosities, and natural language with its system of number
              words and other quantifiers.  The proposed research investigates each of these
              building block systems and their interactions through experiments on human
              infants, non-human primates, preschool children learning counting, elementary
              school children learning arithmetic and fractions, and adults.  	To study the
              building block cognitive systems directly, experiments investigate spontaneous
              number representations in human infants and in untrained adult monkeys, using
              in each population the same three converging behavioral measures: looking time
              to arrays of different numerosities and to addition or subtraction events
              (building on the finding that both infants and monkeys look longer at novel
              arrays or unexpected events), manual search (building on the finding that the
              number of times that an infant or monkey will search in a container depends on
              the number of objects it represents within the container), and locomotor
              approach to containers with different numbers of attractive objects (building
              on the finding that infants and monkeys will approach the container with the
              greater number of objects).  Further experiments investigate how preschool
              children assemble these components in learning number words and the counting
              routine, by using verbal and pointing tasks to assess developmental changes in
              children's understanding of number words and counting procedures.   To uncover
              the neural substrates underlying mathematical cognition, both behavioral and
              neuroimaging experiments investigate whether and how human adults use each of
              the three representational systems in performing numerical comparisons and
              elementary arithmetic.  Finally, experiments investigate number concepts and
              arithmetic learning in elementary school children.  Training studies in which
              children are taught new facts or concepts and then are tested on a range of
              related problems will serve to investigate the subsystems involved in this
              learning, to probe the processes by which those subsystems are assembled to
              meet new educational challenges, and to explore ways of enhancing mathematics
              learning in elementary school.    	This research promises to shed light on the
              teaching and learning of mathematics through coordinated, laboratory-based
              studies in which monkeys, infants, children and adults are given the same
              stimuli and often the same tasks.  This coordinated effort should provide a
              broad portrait of the sources of mathematical thinking, from its phylogenetic
              and ontogenetic origins to its culmination in educated adults.
