Abstract    :
              This proposal will investigate, design and deploy a suite of novel multicast
              protocols aimed primarily at ad hoc networks.  The investigators maintain
              that, due to the inherent broadcast capability, wireless networks are well
              suited for multicast communication.  The contributions of the proposed suite
              of multicast packet routing and forwarding protocols (IMAHN) can be summarized
              as follows: (1) design, evaluation, prototyping and deployment of a suite of
              multicast routing and packet forwarding protocols for ad hoc networks, and (2)
               development of an integrated multicast routing solution for the mixed-media
              internetwork of the future; this includes investigation, evaluation,
              prototyping, and deployment of mechanisms providing seamless multicast
              service.  IMAHN will emphasize the following: (1) robustness vs efficiency:
              many existing multicast routing approaches rely on state in routers to
              keep track of multicast group members. This, coupled with the high volume
              of routing information exchanges and slow convergence, makes
              traditional multicast approaches untenable in highly dynamic ad hoc networks
              (AHNs) composed of anemic (low-power, low storage capacity) hosts. We propose
              a new technique, adaptive flooding, that stresses rapid and robust
              delivery. IMAHN will consist of a suite of adaptive protocols addressing a
              range of AHNs and mobility patterns. In constantly changing AHNs,
              redundant broadcasting may be appropriate, while, in less dynamic AHNs, a
              range of more bandwidth-efficient multicast protocols will be considered;
              (2) adaptability: hosts should be able to (and will) migrate freely among
              ad hoc, fixed-infrastructure mobile, and traditional wired networks.  In
              order to function appropriately -- when faced with changes in the
              underlying infrastructure -- hosts need switch on-the-fly among multiple
              multicast mechanisms; (3) unlimited mobility: some existing solutions are
              geared towards discrete mobility where periods of movement are interspersed
              with periods of rest. Others assume certain limits on direction, speed
              and number of simultaneously moving hosts. In contrast, we stress
              universal, unlimited mobility of all network components; (4) integrated
              multicast: multicast solutions for AHNs will most likely differ substantially
              from those for fixed networks (one of the main reasons is the marked
              difference in transmission rates). In order to offer seamless and integrated
              multicast service for the mixed-media internetwork of the future, IMAHN will
              develop novel mechanisms for inter-operation of fixed and wireless
              multicast solutions.
