With a Small Grant for Exploratory Research, Georgia Tech
              Research Institute will identify and measure the properties of spatial layout
              that affect visitors' exploration and exposure to information in science museum
              exhibitions.  It is the nature of museum learning that it is associated with
              movement in space.  The ways in which displays are arranged in spatial
              sequences, the ability to simultaneously view different objects, the grouping
              of objects in space, the rate of change in directions, the relative distance
              between one display and another, all become powerful aspects of the
              presentation of knowledge that are far more important in the museum than they
              are in any other learning environment.  This study will apply new techniques
              for spatial analysis to provide rigorous, quantitative descriptions of spatial
              layout.  These descriptors will then be used to understand how layout affects
              visitor movement patterns in exhibitions.
