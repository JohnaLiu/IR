Abstract    :
              EIA-9871478  Megherbi, Dalila  DeLyser, Ronald R.  University of Denver    MRI:
              Development of State-of-the-Art Instrumentation for Advanced Distributed
              Computing Systems for Research and Research Training    This proposal outlines
              the development of a major state-of-the-art instrumentation for
              research/reserach training as well as integrated research/education within the
              departments of Engineering, Mathematics/Computer Science, and Chemistry at the
              University of Denver.  In particular, the proposed research instrumentation,
              identified in this proposal, deals with the development and construction of a
              High Distributed and Parallel Computing Engine composed of a cluster of
              advanced workstations (6) and a collection of multiprocessor PC-class machines
              (10) connected by a fast 16-port ATM switch.  The proposed instrumentation will
              support projects in several areas including: the design, study and application
              of distributed/parallel systems; application of 3D medical imaging and
              visualization; autonomous navigation of distrubuted intelligent multi-agents in
              unstructured and unpredictable environments; interactive distributed systems
              and networks and their relation to human perception and reasoning;
              electromagnetic digital calculations; simulation of large neural networks with
              application to Alzheimer's disease; electron high frequency structure
              simulation and calculation for electron paramagnetic resonance in paramagnetic
              images; numerical heat transfer; numerical stress and field calculation; and
              modeling and simulation of optoelectronic devices and optical systems.
