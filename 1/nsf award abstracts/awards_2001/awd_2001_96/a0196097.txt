This project will examine the maintenance in nature of
              two distinct plumage and behavioral forms of the white-throated sparrow,
              Zonotrichia albicollis.  One morph invests heavily in reproductive effort,
              while the other invests heavily in parental effort.  The genetic basis of these
              forms is known.  Finally, the species mates disassortatively (i.e. opposites
              form pairs) and this leads to both form persisting in the population.  This
              study will investigate why the unusual mating system has been maintained in
              nature, by employing captive breeding, artificial insemination, and the
              development of molecular markers.  The white-throated sparrow system may prove
              to be a classic vertebrate example of how variation in nature persists and it
              will provide a wealth of information that can be applied to studies of other
              systems.
