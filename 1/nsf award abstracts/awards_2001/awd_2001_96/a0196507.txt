Abstract    :
              9634925  Fridley  Wood structures are subject to sustained dead and live  loads,
              and the creep response of the wood under sustained  loads tends to increase
              deflections over time.  The  transverse deflections in wood beam-columns will
              likewise  increase under sustained load due to creep, thus increasing 
              secondary moments.  Creep has long been acknowledged as a  factor which must be
              considered in the design of wood  structures; however, the effect of creep on
              the combined  load behavior of wood members has not been studied  adequately
              nor has the effect been included in design  equations.  The objectives of this
              research, are to (1)  experimentally evaluate and model the effect of creep on
              the  combined load behavior of structural wood members, (2)  evaluate the
              subsequent effect on member reliability, and  (3) propose factors for use in
              design equations to account  for such behavior.  ***
