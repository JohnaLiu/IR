This U.S.-Poland Cooperative Research award is for a
              project on "The Structure and Spectroscopy of Lanthanide Complexes in Solids,
              Solutions, and Gels" between research groups headed by Dr. James P. Riehl of
              Michigan Technological University and by Professor Janina Legendziewicz of the
              University of Wroclaw.  These two research groups have common interests in the
              study of the molecular and electronic structure, excited state energetics, and
              solution dynamics of lanthanide complexes.  The long term goal for this
              research is the development and exploitation of lanthanide based materials as
              probes of biochemical structure, as luminescent assays, and as therapeutic
              agents. The research projects involved synthesis and characterization of
              lanthanide compounds, and complementary spectroscopic investigations at the two
              sites. 

This research in chemistry fulfills the program objectives of
              bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine
              complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and
              competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of
              benefit.
