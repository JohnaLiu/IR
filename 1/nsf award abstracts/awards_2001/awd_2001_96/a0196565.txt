Abstract    :
              The Proposed study is designed to combine observational results from a variety
              of spacecraft with computational models.  The purpose is to develop a better
              understanding of the processes in the magnetosheath.  These processes divert
              the flow of shocked solar wind plasma around the magnetosphere.  Understanding
              these processes is critical to understanding the complex physics that
              determines the coupling of energy from the solar wind to the earth's
              magnetosphere and eventually to its dissipation in the ionosphere.
