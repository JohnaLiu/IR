Abstract    :
              9732978  Jacko  This research seeks solutions to the technical challenges of 
              designing computer interfaces for user populations  possessing diverse visual
              capabilities.  The theoretical  contribution of the research will be an
              empirical link  between clinical and functional assessments of human vision 
              and the behaviors and strategies exhibited by partially  sighted computer users
              while performing tasks requiring use  of graphical user interfaces.  The
              practical contribution of  the research will be the identification of more
              systematic  approaches to matching users with software and hardware 
              combinations that will accommodate individual users' visual  profiles.  This
              research will be integrated into  undergraduate courses in industrial
              engineering and computer  science, and will enhance the development of new
              graduate  courses in industrial engineering that center upon the  design of
              advanced technologies for people who are visually  challenged.  ***
