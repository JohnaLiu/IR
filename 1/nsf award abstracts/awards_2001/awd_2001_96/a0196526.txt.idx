Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT      The principal investigator proposes to study three problems
              in the area of partial differential equations, namely the nonlinear two-phase
              elliptic free boundary problem, symmetrization for diffusion equations with
              bounded measurable coefficients and symmetric behavior of solutions of
              nonlinear parabolic equations. These problems defy  the standard treatments
              which succeed in solving linear problems or equations in divergence form
              because of their nonlinear or non-divergent structural nature. Therefore,
              solution of these problems will not only contributes knowledge about these
              partial differential equations, but also inspires new ideas which will most
              probably prove useful  in studying other nonlinear partial differential
              equations or equations of other types. The suggested methods in this proposal
               either successfully solved part of the problems or are motivated by  the
              ideas that are most likely to lead to the solution of these problems.     
              The study of the theory of nonlinear elliptic and parabolic
              partial differential equations and diffusion processes becomes
              increasingly important in the area of partial differential equations. The
              problems studied by the principal investigator in this project motivate
              ideas that lead to the creation of some methods that might succeed in
               treating other partial differential equation problems as well. Solving these
              problems gives affirmative answer to the question of the well- posedness of
              these mathematical models which originate in physics and other disciplines. In
              addition, the theoretical treatment of these problems will shed light on the
              numerical solution of these and related problems. Taking into account the
              origins of these problems, one is liable to believe applications of the theory
              about these problems can be sought in disciplines other than mathematics.
