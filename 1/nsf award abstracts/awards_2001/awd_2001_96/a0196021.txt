Abstract    :
              9702871  Van der Weide  Rising clock rates and densities of computational
              integrated circuits engender severe difficulties in inter-chip communication
              and testing.  The research in this CAREER program will explore micromachined
              antenna structures to achieve zero-skew clock  waveform distribution and
              localized excitation and testing of these circuits, even those exhibiting
              quantum effects of electron confinement.  The educational goals of this program
              seek to extend these localized field measurements to a larger scale, making
              planar high-frequency circuits come alive to students, particularly through
              laboratories accessed via near-real-time Web-based instrumentation.  ***
