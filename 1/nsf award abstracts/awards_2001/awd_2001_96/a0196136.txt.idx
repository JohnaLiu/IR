Abstract    :
              985559 smith, c.  Electrical and Optical Monitoring of Facilitation
              Mechanisms in Chromaffin Cells.  	Certain cells of the endocrine and nervous
              system release chemical substances such as hormones and neurotransmitter in
              response to electrical stimulation. These released chemical substances travel
              to target cells or tissues and effect a response. Knowledge of the regulated
              release of hormones and neurotransmitters is critical to our understanding of
              the normal, and abnormal, function of the endocrine, nervous and cardiovascular
              systems, yet remains limited. This proposal outlines a series of experiments
              designed to furnish a more detailed description of the release process, and its
              regulation. It is the goal of this research to elucidate mechanisms by which
              cells control the amount of hormone or neurotransmitter released, and how the
              cells then ready themselves for subsequent activity. Electrical, optical and
              computational techniques will be employed to measure the stimulation-evoked
              release of hormone and neurotransmitter from single cells, as well as to
              quantify and describe the single steps along the release process. 	In a
              broader sense, understanding how biological systems transport and deliver
              molecules to cellular compartments may aid in the future design of
              nanotechnologies for the targeted delivery of bio-active compounds. The
              expansion of this research program at the Medical College of Georgia will
              facilitate training of scientific personnel in these state-of -the-art
              technologies. Finally, the capital investment in this research will strengthen
              the scientific infrastructure required for the further development of
              biotechnologies
