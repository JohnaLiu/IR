SGER: Novel mathematical approaches for
              determining ecosystem structure and dynamics

This SGER proposes to
              investigate the organizational properties of ecosystems with novel mathematical
              approaches.  The investigators will conduct complexity, dimensionality and
              entropy analyses using established mathematical techniques and apply them to a
              multi-variable, long-term ecological data set for an estuary.  The state
              variables (ammonia, chlorophyll a, and salinity) will be evaluated for how they
              change with respect to each other and with time. The objective is to define the
              organizational properties of these ecosystems in such a way that changes in
              microbial community structure can be related in quantitative and predictable
              ways to changes in the trajectories and connectivity of the state variables.
              Ultimately, this work may lead to a better understanding of the processes
              responsible for harmful algal blooms and other emergent phenomena.
