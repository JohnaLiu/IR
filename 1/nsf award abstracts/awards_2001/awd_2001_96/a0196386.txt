The proposed research seeks to empirically connect low
              frequency climate variability to nonstationarity in the frequency of flood
              occurrence. The primary focus is on regions in the Western United States where
              the extreme flood regime is dominated by winter/early spring snowmelt and
              rainfall. Zonal atmospheric flow mechanisms coupled to the planetary jet
              stream, rather than convective thunderstorms determine such events. 
              Nonstationarity of floods in this region has been recognized. The American
              River has experienced 7 floods since 1945 larger than the 100 year flood
              estimated on the basis of the previous 40 years.  Sacramento, California may
              thus have significantly less than 100 year flood protection. The floods have
              come earlier in the year, and there are indications of corresponding changes in
              the seasonality of temperature, precipitation and the snow line. A
              hierarchical, Bayesian framework for relating at site and regional flood
              processes to structured low frequency climate variability will be developed. 
              Hypotheses that relate flood potential to basin precipitation and temperature
              seasonality, to atmospheric circulation patterns, and in turn to modes of the
              ocean-atmosphere system and to anthropogenic climate change will be developed
              and tested using historical hydroclimatic data and ensemble simulations from a
              coupled ocean-atmosphere General Circulation Model.
