Abstract    :
              This proposal presents a radically new multicast model for ad hoc wireless
              networks.  In this model, the content of the multicast data determines the
              receiver set for the data and the receiver set changes dynamically as the
              content of the multicast changes.  Delivering the multicast to intended
              receivers while minimizing the message overhead and reducing battery
              consumption is a challenge made harder because of node mobility.  The content
              of the multicast is specified as time and distance information about the
              evolving situation in a disaster site or in a battlefield.  Here, information
              needs to be multicast to receivers to enable them to construct a completed
              picture of threats and resources in their neighborhood.  However, because some
              receivers may be moving at high speed while others move more slowly, the
              definition of the "neighborhood" varies dramatically thus complicating the
              conduct of the multicast.  The ideas contained in the proposal have a
              significant impact on the efficient distribution of information in ad hoc
              networks by ensuring that only receivers that really need information receive
              it.  Finally, an application on the multicast model to the internet is also
              presented.
