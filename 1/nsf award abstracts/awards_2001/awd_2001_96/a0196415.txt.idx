Abstract    :
              The widespread availability of the personal computer, local area networks, and
              the Internet in work organizations has fostered extraordinary growth in the
              collection of information about workers. Increasingly, organizations use
              networked computer systems in conjunction with specialized hardware and
              software to test, track, and monitor their employees. Wireless technologies
              even facilitate data collection on employees whose work takes them physically
              outside the work premises. Using technology to collect and process information
              about workers raises numerous value-laden questions. An organization's legal
              and financial needs may conflict with workers' autonomy, dignity, privacy, and
              trust in the organization. These opposing needs virtually guarantee conflict.
              The overarching goal of these efforts is to document how technology is and will
              be used to collect data about workers and to understand how these uses of
              technology shape the relationships among workers, managers, and organizations.
              The CAREER award will support a diverse set of research studies, curriculum
              development for undergraduate and graduate students, and the creation of
              publicly available resources to promote examination and awareness of
              organizational technology issues.  The research will focus on individual
              attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Studies will assess these variables from the
              perspectives of both employees and managers. From both perspectives, the
              research will examine privacy beliefs, perceptions of control over personal and
              performance information, trust in the organization, and linkages of these
              factors to fairness beliefs. From the managerial perspective, the research will
              also assess managerial actions and decisions about worker data technology
              within an ethical decision-making framework. A third element in the research
              will contrast employee and manager belief systems. Results from these studies
              will contribute to development of a psychological framework about worker
              information. Finally, a three-year longitudinal study will examine the adoption
              and use of worker data technology in one organization, and its effects on
              managers, employees, and the organization. In addition to the survey methods
              typical to organizational research, the proposed projects will use qualitative
              methods including in-depth interviewing and ethnographic investigation of
              organizational technology use.  The educational component of this CAREER
              award is symbiotic with the research. Ethical management of data about people,
              a cornerstone of research and practice in psychology, is  under-emphasized in
              the curriculum (especially in undergraduate training). Since many psychology
              majors graduate into positions with responsibilities for managing data about
              people, relevant ethical training is needed. The principal investigator has
              both graduate and undergraduate teaching responsibilities, which provides the
              opportunity to develop and test teaching material and methods pertaining to the
              ethical handling of data about people.  In addition to standard scholarly
              outlets, instruments, findings, and norms from the research studies together
              with materials from the curriculum development will serve as the basis for a
              web-based resource center. A toolkit of organizational assessments will be
              publicized to promote further research on worker data technology and related
              topics. Exercises, cases, and other curricular materials on ethical issues
              related to technology and privacy in the workplace will also be publicized.
