Abstract    :
              It has been documented that African Americans and Latinos do not perform as well
              as Whites on standardized tests and in school. Explanations for this problem
              typically point to economic, cultural, and educational factors, and sometimes
              even to group differences in intelligence. However, these factors do not fully
              account for the observed differences because the differences persist even when
              students of different ethnicities are equated in their preparation, skill, and
              socioeconomic status. Other factors must be involved. The PI has documented the
              influence of a powerful psychological factor operating in academic and testing
              situations. This factor -- stereotype threat -- is an apprehension about
              confirming widely-held stereotypes alleging the academic inferiority of certain
              people (e.g., Blacks, Latinos) or of certain people in specific situations
              (e.g., women in mathematics domains). Stereotype threat can arise any time a
              negative stereotype is relevant or pertains to an academic or achievement
              setting (e.g., taking an intelligence test, being called upon in class). In
              past research, testing conditions designed to induce stereotype threat
              dramatically lowered the standardized test performance of African Americans,
              whereas conditions designed to minimize stereotype threat boosted performance.
              The current research uses carefully controlled laboratory experiments to
              examine (1) the factors that give rise to stereotype threat, (2) situational
              factors that can minimize or exacerbate it, (3) the psychological processes
              that govern its influence on achievement, and (4) possible long-term
              consequences stereotype threat on people's achievement-related behaviors and
              self-concepts.
