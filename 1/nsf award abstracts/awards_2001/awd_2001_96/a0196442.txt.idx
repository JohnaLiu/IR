Abstract    :
              The research has as its goal the development of efficient, scalable and 
              portable algorithms that allow learning and limited reasoning over very  large
              repositories of data.  The goal is to combine these algorithms into  an
              environment that supports summarization of very large streams of data  (data
              mining) and  the drawing of reasonably accurate conclusions from  these
              summaries, using probabilistic reasoning where appropriate.   The  following
              areas are being investigated:    (1)  Efficient algorithms for reasoning in
              probabilistic networks;   (2)  Efficient induction of provably accurate
              generalized decision trees; and  (3)  Incorporating knowledge in memory-based
              reasoning methods.    Of particular interest are reasoning algorithms that
              perform queries and  updates to data extremely efficiently, perhaps in time
              which is sublinear  to the size of the original database, and learning
              algorithms that provide  performance guarantees on the accuracy of the answers
              by giving a  confidence rating with the answer to a query.  The availability of
               high-speed, reliable, intelligent algorithms for learning and reasoning  from
              data will have important applications in digital libraries, medical  care,
              process control, and resource allocation, among other areas.
