This is a multi-pronged
              collaborative investigation of stellar open clusters.  The goal is to provide
              useful clues and constraints on a variety of astrophysical problems such as: 
              (1) the shape of the Initial Mass Function and its universality or lack
              thereof;  (2) the extent of convective overshoot in stellar cores; and (3) the
              metallicity gradient in the Galaxy.  The project will also result in a database
              of high quality astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic data for a carefully
              chosen sample of open clusters.  

This grant supports the astrometry portion
              of this investigation.  Positional information, proper motions and cluster
              membership determinations will be acquired for 8 key open clusters to at least
              6 apparent magnitudes (~250x) fainter than previous surveys, while maintaining
              current limits of proper motion accuracy (~0.005 "/yr).  The collaborating team
              will conduct the photometry portion of this investigation.  It will yield UBVRI
              apparent magnitudes and color indices for cluster members to ~1% internal
              precision for all stars in the astrometric database, as well as fainter stars
              in these 8 clusters and 6 additional clusters.  From this data, a 'present day
              mass function' will be determined for a wide range of cluster ages, richness,
              galactic position and metallicity.
