The seismic cycle requires that faults re-strengthen
              between earthquakes. Frictional healing (as evidenced by increasing static
              friction during quasi-stationary contact) is considered the most likely
              mechanism of interseismic strength recovery. However, the mechanisms of
              frictional healing are poorly understood. This proposal is to study the
              physical and chemical mechanisms of fault healing and frictional aging in
              simulated granular fault gouge. The results of the experiments will have
              significant implications for understanding the distinction between time- and
              slip-dependent friction evolution. Recent theoretical studies of dynamic
              rupture indicate that this distinction plays a key role in determining seismic
              characteristics such as frequency-magnitude scaling and the mode of rupture
              expansion (as a classical, self-similar crack or a self-healing slip pulse).
              Thus, the results will connect in an important way to other studies of
              earthquake source physics including theoretically-based studies and those based
              on field observations.
