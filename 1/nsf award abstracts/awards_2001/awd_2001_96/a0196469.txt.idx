Abstract    :
              9981394 Dorit  This project proposes to re-evolve a critical component of the
              metabolic machinery of all living cells, the ribonucleoprotein RNaseP.  The
              experimental evolution system that permits replacement of the naturally
              occurring RNaseP found in the E. coli bacterium with alternate, engineered
              versions.  These synthetic versions, derived either from the variants of RNaseP
              present in related bacteria, or designed in the laboratory, are placed on a
              plasmid vector and used to displace the endogenous RNaseP.  Repeated
              generations of in vivo experimental selection result in the evolution of fully
              functional alternatives that can then be compared and contrasted to their
              naturally occurring counterparts.  This study is one of the first explicit
              attempts to uncover the existence of alternate functional versions of important
              metabolic components that are not seen in the natural world.  While the
              versions of RNaseP present in contemporary organism are the exquisite result of
              billions of years of natural evolution, they likely represent but a small
              subset of possible solutions to the catalytic challenges facing bacteria.  This
              system delves into these roads not taken, and explores the space separating
              existing solutions to a given catalytic challenge.  In so doing, the relative
              roles played by contingency, chance, and selection can be understood.  This
              system also provides a general tool with which to probe the functional
              flexibility of any component of the metabolic machinery, as well as a method
              for testing the performance of engineered alternatives to naturally occurring
              proteins and nucleic
              acids.                   H:\popbio\abstracts\fy2000\9981394
