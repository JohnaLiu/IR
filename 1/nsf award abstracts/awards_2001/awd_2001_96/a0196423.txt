Abstract    :
                Towle  9807539         Euryhalinity, the ability to tolerate a breadth of 
              environmental salinities, is a property of a small number of  plant and animal
              species. However, some euryhaline species  may be very prolific, exemplified by
              the blue crab in the  Chesapeake Bay. The PIs goals are to discover the
              molecular  mechanisms that enable euryhalinity, focusing on a group of  closely
              related animals that exhibit an array of adaptations  to salinity. The blue
              crab Callinectes sapidus is itself  extremely euryhaline, thriving in fresh
              water and lagoons  more concentrated than normal sea water. Its close relative,
               Callinectes similis, however, cannot survive dilute  salinities. The PIs will
              study these plus a third  intermediate species, the green shore crab Carcinus
              maenas,  to describe the genes and proteins that make euryhalinity  possible.  
               The PIs will focus on three candidate transporter proteins  that may regulate
              the uptake of sodium by the gill. The PIs  hypothesis is that the genes coding
              for important proteins  will be active in tolerant species but inactive or less
               active in intolerant species. All of the candidate  transporter proteins have
              been implicated in salt handling    by kidneys of mammals and other
              vertebrates. If the PIs are  able to demonstrate salinity-related activation of
              one or  more of the transporter genes, the PIs  will embark on a  search for
              the hypothetical regulatory "sodium uptake  response element" ("SURE").
