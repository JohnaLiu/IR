Abstract    :
              Soil moisture is a key controlling factor for numerous ecological and
              biophysical processes.  While diverse techniques are available to make point
              estimates of soil moisture, spatially extensive surveys can be logistically
              difficult and fraught with problems of interpolation.  Remote sensing of soil
              moisture offers the possibility of  exhaustive spatial  sampling.  The efficacy
              of microwave sensors (both active and  passive) in measuring soil moisture is
              well-studied.  However, little research has focused on patterns  of radar
              imagery of natural landscapes.  Yet, there is a distinct need to assess the
              potential of  Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for routine environmental
              monitoring of land surface processes.  Environmental monitoring of vegetated
              landscapes will increase during the next decade as data from  spaceborne SAR
              platforms become more readily available.  The project involves the use of SAR
              data  from the European, Canadian, and Japanese orbital platforms to address
              the variation in canopy and  soil moisture and its ecological consequences. 
              These data augment current investigatio ns at two NSF  Long Term Ecological
              Research (LTER) sites, Konza prairie Research Natural Area in the northeast 
              Kansas and Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in central New Mexico.  Both LTER
              sites are located  within ecological transitional zones (ecotones) in which
              soil moisture is a major determinant of plant  productivity and species
              composition.  The primary products are site-specific time series of soil 
              moisture and canopy change maps.  These data will then be used to link remote
              sensing and groundtruth  data with ecological processes.
