Abstract    :
              The gastrointestinal tract receives a portion of its extrinsic nerve supply via
              the vagus nerve. Vagal motor fibers controlling gastrointestinal motility and
              secretion originate in distinct areas of the brainstem, specifically in the
              dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) which, thus, represents the final
              integration site of the circuits that form the basis of gastrointestinal
              reflexes. The integrative circuitry involved in these reflexes is, as yet,
              unknown.  In order to understand the ways, in which the brain influences and
              controls the gastrointestinal tract, one must understand the cellular basis of
              the nuclei involved in its function. The experiments planned in this
              application will combine state of the art electrophysiological recordings from
              identified gastrointestinal motoneurons in brainstem slices with morphological
              reconstructions to examine the hypothesis that the DMV is organized so that
              neurons with similar properties control selectively specific areas of the GI
              tract.  We aim to test this hypothesis by correlating the location, morphology
              and target organ of DMV neurons with their cellular properties.

We expect
              that the results of these studies will provide new insights into the
              neurophysiology of the DMV and allow us to make a major contribution to our
              understanding of the central nervous system regulation and coordination of GI
              function.
