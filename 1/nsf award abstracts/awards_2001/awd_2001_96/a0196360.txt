Abstract    :
              9813257  Gogotsi       The objectives of this research project are to:  (1)
              Investigate the phase composition of machining debris and machined surfaces of
              Si, Ge, GaAs, InSb, CdTe and, eventually, other semiconductors using
              micro-Raman spectroscopy.  (2) Use the indentation and scratch tests instead of
              much more complicated and expensive real machining experiments for prediction
              and optimization of the conditions of ductile machining.  (3) Predict and
              optimize single-point diamond turning conditions based on the obtained
              information.  (4) Perform actual single point diamond turning of above
              mentioned materials, verify surface quality and ductile regime chip removal
              mode, and its resulting advantages in terms of damage-free and super flat
              machined surfaces.  (5) Quantify the reduction in manufacturing process time of
              silicon wafers, GE, and other semiconductors compared to current
              lapping-polishing methods.       If successful, this research will bridge the
              gap between the materials science theory and practice of machining and change
              the approach to the selection and optimization of the ductile regime conditions
              from "trial-error" to "prediction-verification" tests.  This will provide a
              fast and reliable ultra-precision machining method for brittle semiconductors,
              which will produce a better surface quality and dimensional accuracy.  The same
              micro-Raman technique that is used for identification of the ductile regime
              will be used for quality control of machined surfaces.
