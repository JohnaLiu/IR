                                 Recent research along the western margin of North America
              has demonstrated large-scale dextral strike-slip faulting in the early
              Cretaceous along the central Sierra Nevada, and this fault system has been
              postulated to extend much further along the margin.  However, present age
              constraints and geometric relationships to the north do not allow this to be
              tested.  Prior work in the Black Rock Desert region of Northwest
              Nevada/southern Oregon has discovered evidence for large-displacement faulting
              that is a likely candidate for the northward continuation of the Mojave-Snow
              Lake fault.  It appears to be aligned with the large but problematic Idaho
              Suture feature to the north.  This research is a collaborative effort between
              research at Rice University and the University of Georgia, and will pursue this
              potential correlation by an integrated study of the distribution, kinematics
              and temporal evolution of early Cretaceous deformation in the Black Rock
              Desert.  Results will be critical to tectonic reconstruction of the Mesozoic
              history of the western margin of North America.
