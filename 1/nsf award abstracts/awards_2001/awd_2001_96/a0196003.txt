              Research and Education in Natural Disaster Risk Assessment
This project
              includes integrated research and educational activities related to natural
              disaster risk assessment.  A structure's vulnerability to natural disasters can
              significantly affect the safety of its occupants and the security of the
              economic investment it represents.  Nevertheless, natural disaster
              vulnerability has little influence on decisions related to buying, financing,
              insuring, and occupying structures.  With the ultimate goal of
              institutionalizing natural hazards information in these structure-related
              decisions, the research activities involve (1) developing a model system for
              rating a structure's multihazard natural disaster risk, (2) applying the rating
              system to a sample of structures in three U.S. cities to validate it, and (3)
              developing an interactive Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based
              application to disseminate the rating tool.

The educational activities aim
              to enhance engineering education's traditional emphasis on problem-solving
              skills and technical fundamentals by using the study of natural disaster
              vulnerability and risk to focus attention on contextual issues, communication
              skills, diversity, building the desire and capability for lifelong learning,
              and a new image of civil engineering as a field of public service.  These
              objectives are addressed by (1) developing a course on natural disaster risk,
              (2) including undergraduate students in natural disaster risk research, and (3)
              mentoring students from underrepresented populations, especially women.  In
              addition, public awareness of natural disaster risk is raised by including a
              technology transfer component in the research activities, and by participating
              in local disaster mitigation activities, such as the Charlotte-Mecklenburg
              Project Impact effort.  The research and educational plans of this CAREER
              proposal complement each other so that together they will be more effective
              than either would be alone.
