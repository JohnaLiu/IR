Sarajedini, Ata
"Collaborative Project: Deep Astrometry and
              Photometry of Key Open Clusters: A New Foundation for Stellar
              Astrophysics"
AST-9819768

This is a multi-pronged collaborative
              investigation of stellar open clusters with Imants Platais at Yale University
              (AST-9819777).  The goal is to provide useful clues and constraints on a
              variety of astrophysical problems such as:  (1) the shape of the Initial Mass
              Function and its universality;  (2) the extent of convective overshoot in
              stellar cores; and (3) the metallicity gradient in the Galaxy.  The project
              will also result in a database of high quality astrometric, photometric and
              spectroscopic data for a carefully chosen sample of open clusters that will
              provide a benchmark for many unrelated future studies.  

This grant supports
              the photometry portion of this investigation.  UBVRI apparent magnitudes and
              color indices for cluster members will be obtained to ~1% internal precision
              for all stars in the astrometric database, as well as for fainter stars in
              these 8 clusters and 6 additional clusters. The collaborating team will conduct
              the astrometry portion of this investigation. Positional information, proper
              motions and cluster membership determinations will be acquired for 8 key open
              clusters to at least 6 apparent magnitudes (~250x) fainter than previous
              surveys, while maintaining current limits of proper motion accuracy (~0.005
              "/yr).  From this data, the present distribution of stars by mass will be
              determined for a wide range of cluster ages, richness, galactic position and
              metallicity.
