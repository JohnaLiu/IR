Precambrian tectonic events in the southwest United
              States involved accretion of island arcs and continental fragments accompanied
              by regional metamorphism and extensive pluton emplacement.  However, the
              tectonic setting of several of these events is not well understood, and is
              complicated by the possibility of two periods of regional high grade
              metamorphism affecting these rocks.  This research will investigate an area in
              northern New Mexico having a strong 1.4 Ga regional metamorphism but no exposed
              1.4 Ga plutons that might impart a local thermal and strain perturbation.  The
              research will attempt to apply a new age-dating technique to separate the 1.4
              Ga metamorphism from residual 1.65 Ga metamorphism and to combine results with
              structural and metamorphic studies in order to develop a better understanding
              of the regional 1.4 Ga tectonic setting.
