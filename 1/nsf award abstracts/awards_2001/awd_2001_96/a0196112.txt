Abstract    :
              The investigators will determine whether combined solar observations from a
              white light coronagraph and extreme ultraviolet imager on the SOHO spacecraft
              provide an unambiguous signature of an Earthward directed coronal mass ejection
              (CME). They will also perform a statistical study of these observations as a
              predictor of geomagnetic storms.  Their approach  is to use 30 months of LASCO
              and EIT observations to expand the analysis from a few individual cases now
              published into general rules suitable for forecasting. A technique for
              forecasting CME's and their geomagnetic consequences would directly benefit the
              National Space Weather Program. The project should also provide scientific
              insight into the three-dimensional structure of CME's.
