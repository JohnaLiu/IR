The goal of
              this CAREER project is to make a tool for haptic
structural modeling. This
              tool will be a virtual environment.  A user
will be able to see and fly
              through a large structure.  The user will,
also, be able to touch the
              structure, to feel its resistance, and to
push on it. To do this, I intend to
              merge a haptic interface tool into
an augmented reality setting.

My
              objectives for the next four years are:

1. To make a virtual environment for
              modeling three-dimensional
frame structures using VRML and interface it to
              DRAIN-3DX, a
program for structural analysis of civil structures.

2. To
              incorporate a haptic interface in this virtual environment
and develop a
              haptic rendering methodology for large structure,
enabling the user to push
              the structure and feel its deformation.

3. To interface the virtual modeling
              environment and the
real laboratory environment by making it possible to
              address
virtual and real sub-structures through the same interface.
              

Development of a haptic structural modeling tool is a challenge.
Haptic
              rendering of large objects is an open problem. Design of a
haptic interface to
              virtual and real substructures has not been done
before, but may have a
              broader significance for a Network for
Earthquake Engineering Simulation
              (NEES), a five-year NSF initiative
taking off in 1999.

The challenges are
              here, but the benefits of having a haptic learning
tool are huge! Students
              will be able to touch structures, resist land
slides, feel earthquake
              vibrations and immerse in fluid flow. This
haptic tool will take learning from
              hearing and seeing to touching and
doing... and understanding, as Lao Tsu
              meant two-and-a-half millenia
ago.
