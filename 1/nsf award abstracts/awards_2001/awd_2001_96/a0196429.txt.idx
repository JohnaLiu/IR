Abstract    :
              9911734 LEDERMAN  This proposal, sponsored by Oregon State University, will
              carry out a five-year leadership program in secondary science which, over the
              life of the project, will impact 400 teachers, mostly in schools in rural
              Oregon.  In a three-week summer program the project staff will teach
              participating teachers content knowledge, supervise teachers in current
              research projects, practice techniques for using inquiry in the classroom,
              demonstrate techniques of using technology in the classroom in support of
              science inquiry and work with teachers to develop appropriate pedagogy.  During
              the academic year the teachers will receive support from project staff to help
              them implement the program and to help them work with colleagues.  Each year a
              cadre of teachers, designated as mentor teachers, will be selected from the
              participants to work with other teachers in the project for the duration of the
              activities.  Thus, by the end of the project a substantial number of the
              workshop teachers will have significant mentoring experience.  All teachers in
              the project will be supported in the schools as they implement inquiry
              techniques in their classrooms.
