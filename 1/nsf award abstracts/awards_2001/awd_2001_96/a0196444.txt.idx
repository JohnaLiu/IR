Abstract    :
              This project will develop and implement new algorithms for high performance,
              highly parallel computers to enhance the Spectral Element Ocean Model developed
              at Rutgers University. As a testbed for this algorithmic development, the code
              produced will be applied to multi-scale global oceanic simulations which will
              focus on the Northeast Pacific continental shelves, including the Western Coast
              of the United States and the Coastal Gulf of Alaska.  These regions are at the
              center of an investigative program aimed at understanding how physical
              processes, with multiple temporal and spatial scales, influence marine
              ecosystems.  The new algorithms developed will address the computational
              difficulties associates with the long and multi-scale global oceanic
              simulations.  The research will focus on robust two-and three-dimensional
              elliptic iterative solvers, optimization of the code on cache-based processors,
              and scalable parallel performance on unstructured grids.  In particular it will
              exploit a new treatment for fast eaves that avoids splitting the barotropic
              mode and, thus, eliminates the shallow water equations from the model.
