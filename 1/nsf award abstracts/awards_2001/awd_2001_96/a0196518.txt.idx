Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT    OPP-9713999, 9732732   SCHIMEL, WELKER, PING  UNIV. CALIFORNIA,
              UNIV. WYOMING, UNIV. ALASKA    This project is designed to develop a sufficient
              understanding of winter carbon dynamics in arctic soils to model effectively
              the spatial dynamics of winter carbon dioxide fluxes, and how they will vary
              with altered climate.  The work will involve field measurements of carbon
              dioxide fluxes and environmental factors likely to control them coupled to
              modeling and mechanistic studies.  The project has four main objectives: 1) to
              quantify the magnitude and timing of winter carbon dioxide fluxes across a
              range of arctic tundra types; 2) to determine how winter respiration is
              controlled by the physical regime of the soils; 3) to evaluate how organic
              matter composition control winter carbon cycling; and 4) to develop simple
              models of winter microbial activity.  These objectives will link the soil
              thermal and unfrozen water regimes to microbial activity and substrate use. 
              The overarching goal is to develop the simplest possible models that can be
              driven by broad scale parameters while retaining necessary mechanistic
              information to provide reliable estimates of carbon dynamics.
