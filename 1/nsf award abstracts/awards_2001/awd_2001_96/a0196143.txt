              ABSTRACT

OCE-0082166

Researchers at the Bermuda Biological Station for
              Research hypothesize that there is a supplementary source of  fixed nitrogen to
              the subtropical thermocline of western Sargasso Sea in the form of organic N
              species laterally advected into the upper ocean of the region from distant
              sources via  the Florida Current and Gulf Stream. Subsequent mineralization of
              this organic material is needed to yield nitrogen:phosphorous ratios consistent
              with present geochemical estimates than those expected based on direct
              observation of local N2 fixation rates in the region. In the source regions in
              the Caribbean and Tropical Atlantic, directly evaluated biological measurements
              of nitrogen fixing rates have been described as being more vigorous than that
              observed in the western North Atlantic. Further, the proposed spatial field
              measurements are expected to reveal the physical mixing processes responsible
              for this transport into the subtropical gyre. The index parameters N*and a
              derived quantity, ProN*, will be used to indicate the degree to which the
              observed dissolved inorganic nitrate concentration is in excess of that
              expected from the remineralization of phosphate at Redfield stoichiometries.
              The field program of spatial sampling within the Caribbean, along the western
              boundary current and in the western Sargasso will be examined against the
              temporal variability at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Station (BATS).
