Abstract    :
              Ongoing studies of the "Deep Probe" teleseismic transects, which cross a major
              Archean-Proterozoic suture in Wyoming and Colorado, pose questions that
              analysis of the co-located Lodore broadband data can address.  The very dense
              teleseismic sampling provided by this array - one year of recording from 33
              stations distributed in a 2-D grid at 5-10 km station spacing - will allow
              detailed imaging of crustal and mantle structure.  We propose to use
              3-dimensional Kirchoff migration to:  1) depth migrate Pms and Ppms Moho
              arrivals and other potential discontinuities observed in the upper 100 km; 2)
              migrate the P-wave coda to search for coherent near-surface scattering due to
              topography and sedimentary basins; 3) image the amplitude/sharpeness/scattering
              characteristics of the 410 and 660 km discontinuities.  Integration of this
              proposed research with our Deep Probe results will allow us to better define
              what processes are currently reworking this circum-cratonic region, and if the
              Archean and Proterozoic lithosphere is responding differently to the reworking
              event.
