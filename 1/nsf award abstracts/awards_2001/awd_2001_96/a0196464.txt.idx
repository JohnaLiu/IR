Abstract    :
              Engineering - Materials Science (57)  This project is adapting a course,
              originally developed at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in materials
              chemistry, to fit the needs of freshman engineering students at Virginia
              Commonwealth University's new School of Engineering. This course is being
              designed to provide students the fundamental knowledge required to perform
              materials selection and is key to integrating design in upper level courses.
              Rensselaer had changed the mode of delivery in this multidisciplinary course
              from the traditional lecture-recitation format to an interactive studio format
              that integrated lecture, recitation, team problem solving, and experimentation
              into a single learning experience. As a small engineering school, VCU cannot
              completely adopt the studio model; therefore, the plan is to create studio
              recitations, integrate the laboratory into the class sessions, and develop an
              effective text with internet based supplemental material.  Focus is on the
              studio-based recitation as the key learning experience. The course format is
              being modified such that there are two one-hour lectures and two ninety-minute
              recitations each week.  VCU is integrating the laboratory into the studio-based
              recitation. Student teams are typically conducting similar experiments on
              different materials. Their results are the subject of class discussion, and
              students are being asked about the laboratory as part of their homework
              assignment or individual test questions.  Emphasis is being placed on a higher
              level of learning. The goal is to have students be able to make design
              decisions based upon experimental data, consider alternative processes or
              materials, and effectively communicate these opinions.  VCU is disseminating
              via a textbook being prepared exclusively for use in a first-year common
              engineering course, and supplemented with an internet-based CD containing
              hints, narrative solutions to homework problems, lecture overheads including
              speaker notes and animations, and virtual laboratories.
