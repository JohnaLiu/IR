Abstract    :
              9725648  Molnar    The P. I. and collaborators will carry out an investigation
              of  convective  instability of a mechanically thickened boundary  layer, with
              the goal of understanding processes that might occur  beneath mountain belts
              when crust, and presumably mantle  lithosphere too, is thickened during
              mountain building.  They will  perform numerical experiments with fluids in 2
              and 3 dimensions,  with depth- and temperature-dependent viscosity and with
              non-  linear viscosity.  They seek simple scaling laws that will allow a 
              transfer of experimental results with temperature-dependent and 
              strain-rate-dependent viscosity to the range of plausible  conditions in the
              earth.  Three-dimensional calculations will  concentrate on determining how
              planforms depend on magnitudes and  distributions of perturbations to the
              boundary layers of fluids  with depth-dependent viscosity and later
              temperature-dependent  viscosity, both with and without moving top boundaries. 
              Two-  dimensional calculations will focus on the effect of non-linear 
              viscosity on growth rates of instabilities and on magnitudes of  thinning of
              the boundary layer.  It is anticipated that they will  develop scaling laws
              that relate magnitudes of perturbations and  rheological structure to growth
              rates and magnitudes of  lithospheric thinning that can relate observed
              geologic structures  and measured timing of processes beneath mountain belts.
