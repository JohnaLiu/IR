The Principal Investigator's main interest is the study
              of
geometric structures arising from equivariant harmonic maps to
R-trees,
              especially where the domain is a compact 3-manifold or a
symplectic
              4-manifold. Harmonic maps to non-positively curved
metric spaces have had many
              applications to rigidity-type
questions. At the same time, group actions on
              R-trees (a
particular example of such a metric space target) have played
              an
important role in combinatorial group theory and 3-manifold
topology. 
              This proposal seeks to understand the relationship
between the analytic and
              topological aspects of these problems.
The research will explore the
              interaction between harmonic maps
and incompressible surfaces, taut
              foliations, and essential
laminations in 3-manifolds.  A second part of this
              project will
study the notion of an SL(2,C) Casson
              invariant.

Mathematicians have long been interested in classifying
              the
possible shapes of geometric spaces.  Of particular relevance to
the
              physical world are spaces of dimensions three and four.
These are, perhaps
              surprisingly, also intimately related to the
study of knots.  Classically, the
              methods used for research in
this area have come from algebra, topology, and
              analytic function
theory.  More recently, in part motivated from the physics
              of
vortices, new techniques have been developed involving maps which
minimize
              energy.  This project seeks to explore the topological
ramifications of this
              approach.
