Abstract    :
              9970413  Our research is directed toward better understanding the internal
              structure and representation theory of certain classes of finitely generated
              noncommutative algebras.  The specific motivating examples include algebraic
              quantum groups and enveloping algebras of Lie superalgebras. The focus is
              mainly on prime and primitive ideal theory, and the underlying goal is to study
              primitive spectra in this context as a type of ``noncommutative affine
              algebraic geometry.''  Similarly, we seek to determine analogies between the
              primitive spectra of noncommutative Hopf algebras and affine algebraic groups;
              this latter objective is largely motivated by the role noncommutative Hopf
              algebras play in the theory of quantum groups.  The technical issues we are
              concered with in this work include morphisms, deformations, catenarity, module
              extensions, and ``small'' infinite dimensional quantum groups.  The subjects
              of our research are noncommutative associative algebras.  These abstract
              objects have provided an effective setting for studying systems of polynomial
              equations in noncommuting variables; such equations are basic to twentieth
              century mathematics and physics. Our aim in this research is to study a type of
              ``geometry'' arising from certain noncommutative systems of equations, in
              analogy to the classical geometry obtained from solutions to systems of
              polynomial equations in commuting variables.
