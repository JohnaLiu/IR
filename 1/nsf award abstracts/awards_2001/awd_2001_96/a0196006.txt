The
              processes which govern fluid processes in pipes are well understood for
              diameters in the range of micrometers and above. As the diameters diminish (
              e.g. in the range of a few nanometers), the role of surface tension and
              capillarity  is has been seen to change, as well as their dependence on
              material properties. Thus, the expected promise of  Carbon nanotubes in
              technological applications is in urgent need of a well documented basic
              understanding of such forces, especially since no consistent experimental data 
              have  been collected so far.
   The PI has obtained  preliminary results in
              the determination of the liquid/vapor distribution in nanotubes, with the help
              of  transmission  electron spectroscopy. On that basis , he offers to develop
              an experimental program which will explore as thoroughly as possible the
              various aspects of phase interfacing in a number  of  nanotube  situations. The
              special case of the newly developed closed nanotubes will be examined . Such
              work should offer a precious set of data for the elaboration of a  model based
              on precise experimental observations.
