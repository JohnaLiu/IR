The western US is an example of a diffuse plate
              boundary, where the total strain caused by the Pacific-North American relative
              plate movement is not entirely accommodated by the boundary transform.  This
              project will continue investigations of late Quaternary strain release across
              the northern Basin and Range province as part of a large effort to understand
              how strain is partitioned and accommodated at this diffuse plate boundary. 
              Results are expected to lead to better models of the dynamics of Basin and
              Range faulting and how they relate to the overall plate boundary
              organization.
