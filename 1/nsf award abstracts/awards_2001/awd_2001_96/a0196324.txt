              Instrumentation: Establishing a Laboratory for Research in Parallel Computing
              and Signal Processing

The Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer
              Science at Lehigh University will purchase computing and networking equipment,
              which will be dedicated to support research in computer and information science
              and engineering.  The equipment will be essential for several research
              projects:

Portable Parallel Tools for Algorithm Design, Analysis and
              Bottleneck Detection

Distributed Signal Detection with Emphasis on Acoustic
              Systems

The goal of these projects involves developing Hi-PPAD (High
              Performance Parallel Algorithm Designer), an environment that consists of a set
              of tools to provide designers with the ability to produce efficient
              high-performance algorithms on distributed-memory parallel machines focusing on
              rigorous algorithmic design through an integrative framework.  In order to
              provide an intuitive approach to tool design, we propose a framework
              /classification scheme for high performance computing algorithms/code.  This
              framework will provide a building block approach to tool design through a
              concise model of parallel algorithms and the criteria that compose a parallel
              algorithm.  Both of these projects involve running computer intensive
              simulations and codes that require powerful dedicated processors, large RAM
              capacity, and large I/O capacity.
