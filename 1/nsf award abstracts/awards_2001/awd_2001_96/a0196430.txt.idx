Abstract    :
              9977522 Hill  Funding from the Major Research Instrumentation program will be
              used to acquire a micro-calorimeter system integrated with a 10 tesla
              split-coil superconducting magnet.  The spilt coil configuration is required in
              order obtain magnetic fields at rotated at different orientations relative to
              the experimental probe.  A range of projects will benefit significantly
              from the acquisition of  this instrument.  These projects, which will impact
              the research efforts of several groups at Montana State University, , include:
              i) thermodynamic studies of the unconventional (non-Fermi liquid) conducting
              states in quasi-one dimensional molecular conductors; ii) electronic specific
              heat of bulk quantum Hall systems; iii) thermodynamic investigations of
              magnetic relaxation processes in nano-scale magnetic clusters and molecules;
              iv) critical phenomena in ferroelectric and ferromagnetic perovskites; and v)
              the soliton contribution to the magnetic specific heat in two-dimensional
              magnets.  All of the materials of interest are highly anisotropic and,
              therefore, necessitate studies for different magnetic field orientations.  In
              addition, the magnet will be used in combination with other techniques for
              which the experimental probe cannot conveniently be rotated within a
              conventional axial magnet, for instance, electron paramagnetic resonance,
              nuclear magnetic resonance, dielectric and microwave conductivity
              measurements.  Major Research Instrumentation funding is being used to obtain
              instrumentation that will be used to study a variety of materials that exhibit
              low-dimensionality.  The instrument will have a great impact on the research
              infrastructure at the university as it will impact research projects from
              investigators from several departments at the university as well as from other
              institutions.  This instrumentation will have a large impact on student
              learning, as it will be used to demonstrate magnetic phenomena at the K-12
              level as well as being used by undergraduate through post-doctoral students for
              research projects.
