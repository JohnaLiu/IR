              Abstract    Proposal:  DMS-9803550  Principal Investigator:  Richard Hamilton   
              Richard Hamilton will work on non-linear parabolic partial   differential
              equations and systems of equations in science and   geometry, including the
              evolution of a Riemannian metric by its Ricci   curvature: the motion of a
              surface by its mean curvature or its Gauss   curvature, the flow of gas in a
              porous mechanism, the motion of a   liquid crystal, and others.  Special
              emphasis will be on the formation   of singularities, using precise models to
              show their explicit   structure.    These equations model many interesting
              phenomena in science where   diffusion occurs.  As examples: applications occur
              in material science   to the motion of the boundary between a solid and a
              liquid, the wear   of rocks under impact at a random angle, and the diffusion
              of oil in   shale; in biology to the reproduction of sparse species and the  
              migration of solitary animals; in photography to image sharpening; and   in
              general relativity to the shape of the universe.
