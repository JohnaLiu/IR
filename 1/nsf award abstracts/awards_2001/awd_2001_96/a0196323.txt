Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project completes development
              of a production In-Bed Exerciser (IBEX) and tests its efficacy.  This unique,
              active exerciser is a portable and efficient means of giving, in bed, physical
              therapy sufficient to maintain or restore the walking muscles of bedridden
              people.  Geriatrics are especially vulnerable to bed confinement; they can lose
              ability to walk after 5-10 days.  Becoming bedridden is a leading indicator of
              mortality for the elderly.  A growing elderly population, a shortage of
              Physical Therapists, their inability to provide force levels and intensity of
              exercise needed, and pressure to constrain medical costs, demand such a
              machine.  The Company has innovated a portable exerciser that attaches to the
              bed, is computer controlled, provides bilateral, reciprocal or one-leg exercise
              and records performance.  Phase I demonstrated feasibility.

The objective of
              this SBIR Phase II project is to use scientifically designed clinical trials to
              prove efficacy.  Results are the prelude to successful commercialization
              according to the enclosed plan.  The greatest social benefit will be improved
              quality of life for the elderly.
