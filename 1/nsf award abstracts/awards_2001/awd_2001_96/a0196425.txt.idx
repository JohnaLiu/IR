Abstract    :
               Lake, George AST-9979891  Dr. Lake and collaborators will build on their
              previous algorithms for N-body simulations and analysis and visualization
              techniques to provide a broader framework and adopt an open development
              approach.  The interdisciplinary team will create an object-oriented framework
              that 1) allows for greater flexibility in the use of the code in astrophysics,
              adding key elements such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics and collisional
              dynamics of planetesimals, 2) permits modules to be easily borrowed for other
              applications, 3) integrates protein folding into the current system and
              provides modules to groups doing global climate models and atmospheric data
              assimilation, 4) integrates the code with a visualization package allowing for
              both computational steering and stronger comparisons with data, and 5)
              preserves the ability of the current code to run efficiently on a wide variety
              of computer architectures.   The simulations will allow them to address
              questions in a variety of fields, from astrophysics, to the formation and
              evolution of the solar system, to protein folding, and climate modeling.
