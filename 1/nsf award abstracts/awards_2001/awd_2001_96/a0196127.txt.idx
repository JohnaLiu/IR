Abstract    :
              9911883 MOONEY  "Science Teacher Enhancement in the Pikes Peak Region
              (STEP-Up)" is a K-6, five-year, Local Systemic Change project for school
              districts in the Colorado Springs area to implement and support long-term
              science education reform in standards-based content, pedagogy, curriculum and
              assessment.  The reform effort grows out of a comprehensive planning process
              led by the five core districts and with Colorado College, Pikes Peak Community
              College, the Hewlett-Packard Company and the United States Space Foundation. 
              The project will impact 47,000 kindergarten through fifth-grade students and
              their 1,300 teachers in 74 schools.  Implementation of the science program will
              be accomplished through a three-tiered staff development model: Induction and
              Mentoring efforts; courses in Science Content, Pedagogy and Assessment; and
              Leadership Development programs.  Tier one is designed to meet the needs of
              teachers new to the kit-based science approach, while tier two is aimed at
              introducing experienced teachers to unifying concepts that blend science
              content and pedagogical understanding.  The third tier impacts selected
              teachers and administrators by providing them with long-term advanced programs
              in science and science education to further ensure a new culture of reflective
              teaching and sustainable reform.
