Van der Weide
By enabling an electrical engineer to work for a few
              months in the laboratory of a molecular biologist, this small grant for
              exploratory research will help to explore the groundwork for imaging
              ion-channel distribution and dynamics with multifunctional scanned probe
              microscopy.  The outcome of this exploratory work will be a proposal to combine
              new techniques borrowed from probing sub-micrometer integrated circuits with
              the pressing need to better understand the nature and function of ion channels
              in neuronal membrane, and will result in benefits to science and students in
              both disciplines.
