This
              project will analyze Kaehler-Einstein metrics on a compact
Kaehler manifold in
              three different ways. The first one is to
study the potential function of the
              Bergman metric of a polarized
compact Kaehler manifold. The first several
              coefficients of the
asymptotic expansion of Zelditch have been computed by
              the
author.  The method I used is complex geometric. Comparing to the
method
              using the paramatrix of the Szego kernel of the unit
circle bundle, our method
              is more straightforward.  We wish to
have some uniform estimates. Even in the
              case of complex
dimension one, this problem is interesting.  In dimension
              two,
the problem is already complicated enough. Tian proved that there
is a
              uniform lower bound for the multi-anticanonical bundle over
a Kaehler-Einstein
              surfaces.  In higher dimensions, the problem
is very important, pointing
              towards the stability of
manifolds. The second one is the computation of the
              Futaki
invariants. This problem is related to the previous one in that
the
              potential function is used in the definition of the Futaki
invariants. Futaki
              invariants can be used not only as the
obstruction towards the existence of
              the Kaehler-Einstein metric,
but also can be used to check the stability of
              manifolds. Since
we are only interested in the Futaki invariants for
              those
varieties which are embedded into some complex projective space,
it is
              reasonable to think that we can compute the invariants
using some "extrinsic"
              information(Such as the polynomials in
defining the varieties). In fact, in
              the case that the variety is
a complete intersection, we found a formula to
              calculate the
Futaki invariants.  The last one is on the geometry of
              moduli
space of polarized Calabi-Yau manifold. A Kaehler metric on the
moduli
              space has been defined and was found that the Ricci
curvature of such a metric
              is negative away from zero by the
author. Furthermore, if one can prove that
              the scalar curvature
of the metric is lower bounded, one would be able to
              prove
Viehweg's compactification theorem using differential
              geometric
methods.

Einstein's general theory of relativity interprets the
              concept of
gravity as a geometric property of space-time. The
              main
mathematical tool to study the geometry of these spaces is
differential
              geometry. Since the discovery of general relativity,
differential geometry has
              been crucial to both mathematicians and
physicists. Our project is in one of
              the main fields in
differential geometry, and should add to our understanding
              of
gravity and ultimately the space we are living in.
