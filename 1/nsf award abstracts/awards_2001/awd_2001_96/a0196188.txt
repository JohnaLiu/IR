Abstract    :
              9703870  Ruan    This project lies in the area of Kahler geometry and its
              application to mirror symmetry. More specifically, the investigator is to use
              the idea of Kahler or Riemannian collapsing - a sequence of Kahler manifolds
              and their limit manifold are considered - to further our understanding of
              mirror symmetry.    Riemannian manifolds are curved spaces equipped with a
              notion of distance, also called a metric. The totality of (compact) Riemannian
              manifolds itself can be given a metric so that when given an infinite
              collection of such manifolds it makes sense to talk about clustering or
              converging. Mirror symmetry is a phenomenon first discovered by physicists: in
              the popular 10-dimensional string theory model of the universe, the invisible
              6-dimensions arise as so called Calabi-Yau manifolds possessing certain
              symmetry.
