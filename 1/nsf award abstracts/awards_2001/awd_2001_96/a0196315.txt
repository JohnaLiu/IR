Abstract    :
              

This project involves conducting three experimental studies aimed at
              discovering new ways to overcome undesirable status generalization. Status
              generalization refers to a well-documented tendency, under certain conditions,
              to infer ability based on status characteristics such as ethnicity or skin
              color. This work is aimed at reducing status generalization in classrooms, and
              it builds on a large body of such applied work conducted over several decades
              by other investigators. To the ideas of status generalization theories, these
              experiments add other social psychological processes, including effects of
              motivation, legitimacy of power structures, types of tasks, and stability of
              social structures. Results will be useful for extending theories of status
              generalization, and they should have ready application to practical settings
              such as classrooms and work teams.
