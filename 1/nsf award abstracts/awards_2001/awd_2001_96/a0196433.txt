Abstract    :
              This New Technologies for the Environment project will assess the feasibility of
              using lead-free solder with existing manufacturing equipment, through novel
              processing.  Using this process may have the added benefit that fluxes,
              potentially hazardous organic materials, may be eliminated from the solder
              paste as well.  
Solder joints will be prepared by a solid state process,
              known as sintering where by powders are joined without melting the powder. 
              Sintering is widely used to manufacture ceramics and high temperature metals.
              In the process proposed here, solders considered as alternatives to lead-tin
              solder will be heated to slightly below their melting point and allowed to
              sinter.  Were these alternatives used in conventional processing, electronic
              materials would be exposed to temperatures 50C higher than if lead-tin were
              used.  By sintering, the temperature will actually be reduced.  This technique
              can also be used to form cold solder joints with mechanical integrity. This
              means that a wider range of materials can be considered.

In this project
              students at VCU will prepare novel low flux solder pastes, form joints through
              sintering, and test their mechanical integrity.  The mechanical integrity of
              these joints will be compared to those prepared by lead-tin solder.
