Abstract    :
              The  goal  of  this  research  project  is  to  explore  the  combination  of 
              statistical modeling with heuristic  search  techniques to solve hard
              computational problems in two areas  :  construction  of  a physical map of 
              the  human  DNA  and  automatic learning in computer chess. The approach 
              consists  of  formulating statistical models that are trained on  data  to 
              automatically adjust broad parameters  that  define  the  knowledge   encoded
              in the program. This  is  combined  with  traditional  AI heuristic search
              techniques when  exhaustive  search  of  the parameter or problem space is not 
              possible.  The  results of this research will allow programs to exhibit  a 
              rudimentary form of learning in areas like  chess  games,  as  well as allow a
              physical map of the entire human DNA  to  be constructed in record time of
              about six months which will  allow  geneticists to find the cause of any
              genetic disorder  and  in turn increases the chance of finding cures for these 
              genetic disorders.
