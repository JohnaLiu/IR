Abstract    :
              This award funds programs for research and education with special
emphasis in
              combinatorics and number theory. The investigator
plans to study the
              combinatorics of partition functions, the
structure of elliptic curves, the
              Fourier coefficients
of modular forms, and special values of automorphic
              L-functions.
The investigator hopes to shed further light on the behavior
of
              Mordell-Weil groups of elliptic curves, class groups of number
fields, and
              Selmer groups. In addition to his research, the investigator
proposes a number
              of broadly based activities which constitute
an ambitious and sustained effort
              for the promotion of 
education at all levels.
This includes the mentoring of
              talented high school students locally
within the State College School
              District, and nationally in the
form of an annual workshop run in
              collaboration with the
National Youth Science Foundation. Moreover, the
              investigator
intends to enhance opportunities for graduate students
and
              postdoctoral fellows working in combinatorics and number theory
at Penn
              State.
 

The National Science Foundation strongly encourages the early
              development
of academic faculty as both educators and researchers.  The
              Faculty Early
Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-wide program
              that
provides for the support of junior faculty within the context of
              their
overall career development.  It combines in a single program the support
              of
quality research and education in the broadest sense and the full
              participation
of those traditionally underrepresented in sciences and
              engineering.  This
program enhances and emphasizes the importance the
              Foundation places
on the development of full, balanced academic careers.
