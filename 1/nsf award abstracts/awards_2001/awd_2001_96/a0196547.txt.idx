Abstract    :
              The research will assess the way in which positive feedbacks combine in spatial
              patterns to alter the environment in the neighborhood of existing tree and
              krummholz plants at alpine treeline in Glacier National Park.  The project will
              develop a cellular automaton, and a stochastic version, that uses genetic
              programming to uncover the spatial patterns of feedback processes.  Genetic
              programming will be used so that the rules change in response to how well the
              simulations produce patterns similar to patterns observed in multispectral
              remote sensing imagery.  Both the simulations and the remotely-sensed patterns
              will be at one-meter resolution.  Different patterns of abiotic (pre-feedback)
              site quality, static patterns of vegetation, changing rates of abiotic site
              quality, and different scale relations will be examined through the rules
              created.  This research to examine spatial detail at a finer scale will allow
              exploration of nonlinearities in responses and the potential for the
              organization of ecotone areas as complex adaptive systems.  Linking the
              biogeographical phenomena of ecotones to the body of work on complexity theory
              can improve our understanding of the organization of biome boundaries and make
              a geographical contribution to the theory.  In particular, the research will
              increase our understanding of how a geographic phenomenon may share traits with
              other spatial systems.  This research will also advance the area of
              geographical modeling by incorporating spatial measures of fitness in genetic
              algorithms.  Spatial pattern will be used as the key parameter in genetic
              programming, and the spatial dependencies of the rules produced by this
              programming will be analyzed.  Lastly, this research will advance understanding
              of the mechanisms underlying an important biogeographical concept, the ecotone.
               It will be germane to the idea of ecotones as indicators of the impacts of
              climatic change because of the potential nonlinearities induced by positive
              feedbacks.
