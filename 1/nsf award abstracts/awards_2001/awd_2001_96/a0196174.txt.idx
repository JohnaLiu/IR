Abstract    :
              9800869  Yu    The investigator  proposes to study the K-theory of  Roe algebras
              and group C* algebras.  The  K-theory  of Roe algebras and group C* algebras
              both serve as  receptacles of higher indices of elliptic operators and have 
              important   applications to problems in  differential geometry and topology
              such as the existence problem for Riemannian metrics with positive scalar
              curvature, the Novikov conjecture on the homotopy invariance of higher
              signatures, and the zero-in-the-spectrum conjecture on the spectra  of
              Laplacians.  The methods to be employed   include controlled operator K-theory,
              infinite dimensional almost flat bundles, cyclic cohomology, and combinatorial
              Chern-Connes characters.         Manifolds are spaces glued together by
              Euclidean spaces. Examples of manifolds include spheres and tori. In
              differential geometry one studies how  manifolds are  curved. For example a
              flat piece of paper has zero curvature while the sphere has positive curvature.
              This is why we can not bend a piece of paper into a sphere.  A basic problem in
              differential geometry is to determine when a manifold can have positive scalar
              curvature. Another  important problem in   mathematics is the classification of
               manifolds. By surgery theory the classification problem for higher dimensional
              manifolds  can be essentially  reduced to  the Novikov conjecture. The
              K-theoretic higher indices of certain elliptic differential operators can be
              used to attack the positive scalar curvature problem and the Novikov
              conjecture. A key step in this analytic approach is the computation of the
              K-theory of Roe algebras and group C* algebras.
