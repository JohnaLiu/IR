Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, addresses the mechanism of quantized electron transport in small
              metallic structures.  A novel electrochemical etching/deposition approach is
              used to control the size of metallic nanoconstrictions, while electron
              transport through the constriction is being measured.  Professor Nongjian Tao
              and his coworkers at Florida International University are also investigating
              the effect of molecular adsorption on the surface of the nanoconstriction and
              the resulting changes in electron transport.  This effect may be of use in the
              design of chemical sensors.  Scanning probe microscopy is used to monitor the
              size of the metallic nanoconstriction formed and evaluated under
              electrochemical control.  The flow of electrons through very small metallic
              conductors is governed by quantum mechanical effects.  The ability to measure
              and understand this process is frustrated by the difficulty of preparing stable
              conductors of nanometer dimension.  Using electrochemical control methods, this
              research project addresses this limitation, with the goal of providing
              fundamental understanding of the quantum transport process.  The application of
              these ideas to the design of compact analytical sensors may result from this
              understanding.
