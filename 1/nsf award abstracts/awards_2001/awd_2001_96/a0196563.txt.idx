Abstract    :
              9976851 Dickey  Grain boundary and interfacial segregation have far reaching
              ramifications for many ceramic materials.  The proposed research aims to
              elucidate atomic-scale aspects of interfacial segregation in ionic materials by
              complementary experimental and theoretical studies.  The ultimate goal of the
              research program is to develop predictive principles from which interfacial
              chemistry can be designed to tailor interface physical properties.  Such
              predictive principles will require an understanding of segregation on the
              interrelated aspects of interface atomic structure, point defect chemistry and
              chemical bonding.  The initial material system to be explored will be
              alpha-alumina since this ceramic is well understood and characterized. 
              Moreover, it has been widely demonstrated that segregants, particularly rare
              earth elements, have profound effects on physical properties of alumina such as
              creep and grain boundary transport.  Most of the experimental analyses will be
              based on electron imaging, diffraction and spectroscopy techniques since
              crystallography, atomic structure and chemistry can be studied simultaneously
              and therefore correlated.  Segregation studies on polycrystalline materials
              will be carried out with the aim of exploring the complete multidimensional
              thermodynamic phase space.   For special boundaries, those conducive to
              atomic-scale structure analysis, we will investigate site-specific segregation
              and changes in grain boundary atomic structure and space charge upon doping. 
              Atomic structures will be quantified by high-resolution electron microscopy and
              Z-Contrast imaging.  Electron energy loss spectroscopy will be performed on a
              column-by-column basis to obtain site-specific chemical and electronic
              structure information.  Special symmetric tilt boundaries will be studied in
              parallel by ab initio electronic structure calculations and Monte Carlo
              simulations using semi-empirical potentials.  Transport mechanisms will be
              modeled using transition state theory combined with ab initio calculations, ab
              initio molecular dynamics simulations, and semi-empirical molecular dynamics
              simulations. %%% By performing this systematic series of experiments,
              fundamental knowledge will be gained about interfacial segregation in ceramics
              and the effects on grain boundary diffusion and adhesion.   This information
              can have a large impact on the design of both structural ceramics, such as
              those used in aircraft engines, as well as on functional ceramics, such as
              those used in cell phones and computers.
