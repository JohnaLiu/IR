This is a collaborative project by
              Principal Investigators from Ohio State University and University of Illinois
              at Chicago to clarify the heavily debated northern extent of the Kara Sea Ice
              Sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) around 20 thousand years ago. 
              Uncertainty in the configuration of this major ice sheet and the adjoining
              Barents Sea Ice Sheet has made it difficult to create reliable boundary
              conditions for global climate model simulations.  A successful solution to this
              problem must involve focussed geomorphic, stratigraphic, and geochronologic
              studies of Severnaya Zemlya.

The Principal Investigators will evaluate the
              limits and timing of glacial and deglacial events and associated changes in
              relative sea level on Severnaya Zemlya since the LGM.  A collaborative
              American-Russian-Swedish field program will focus on two key areas where
              earlier researchers found rich deposits of glacial, marine, and terrestrial
              deposits associated with the last glacial/interglacial cycle.  The researchers
              will: 1) determine the magnitude and timing of the LGM glacial-isostatic
              response; 2) define the age and timing of LGM glaciation and deglaciation; and
              3) assess the flow direction of the LGM.  They will determine if the LGM was a
              10-20 km-scale expansion of existing ice caps, at least one km-thick ice sheet,
              or an intermediate complex.

The Principal Investigators will collaborate
              with the glaciological and Earth-rheological modeling communities to improve
              their understanding of climatic, sea-level and intrinsic glaciologic controls
              on LGM glaciation in the High Arctic.  To help reconstruct ice-sheet thickness
              and thinning rates, they will also provide their glacioisostatic data to the
              Earth-rheological modeling community.
