Abstract    :
              Fourth Generation wireless (4G) Networks are expected to provide a wide variety
              of multimedia services to users.  However, these systems will operate under two
              severe constraints - limited battery power and limited spectrum.  This proposal
              addresses each of these two problem areas and describes solution approaches
              that will increase the battery life (more bits transmitted per charge) as well
              as make a more efficient use of the spectrum.  To increase battery life, the
              proposal presents the idea of a stretchable architecture where depleted users
              may set up their connections via some other user who has plenty of remaining
              energy.  The problem of managing the spectrum efficiently is tied in with
              application's Quality of Service (QoS) specifications.  Thus, an application
              controls the amount of spectrum it needs and explicitly trades off the energy
              consumed versus the bandwidth utilized.
