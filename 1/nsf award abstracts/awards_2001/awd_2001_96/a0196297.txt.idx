Abstract    :
              In strongly seasonal environments, such as in mid and high latitudes, most bird
              species reproduce during short periods in spring and summer only. During this
              time, these species also aggressively defend territories. Reproductive activity
              is stimulated by increasing daylength in spring, which also initiates secretion
              of reproductive hormones like testosterone to regulate reproductive and
              territorial behavior. Our understanding of the environmental cues and the
              hormonal mechanisms controlling reproduction and territoriality in birds comes
              almost entirely from studies on temperate zone species. However, the majority
              of bird species live at tropical latitudes, yet for these we have only vague
              ideas of how they adjust these processes on a seasonal basis. In contrast to
              most temperate birds, many tropical birds have adopted long breeding seasons
              and maintenance of permanent territories. Here the Spotted Antbird (Hylophylax
              naevioides) from the rainforest in Panama will be used as a new model species
              for tropical endocrinology, to conduct an in-detail investigation of the
              mechanisms that regulate reproduction and territoriality in tropical birds.
              Previous work has revealed an unusually high sensitivity to small daylength
              changes in these birds, which may allow this species to use photoperiod as a
              seasonal signal in their tropical environment. Experimental manipulations on
              captive Spotted Antbirds will allow to elucidate the mechanism for such
              photoperiodic sensitivity and also show the importance of food cues for timing
              of breeding. Like many other tropical birds Spotted Antbirds can have very low
              levels of testosterone throughout the year, despite aggressively defending
              territories. Field and laboratory experiments in which testosterone levels and
              actions are manipulated will clarify the mechanism that controls aggressive
              territorial behavior year-round. These experiments will test the validity of
              endocrine models developed for temperate zone birds. This project will greatly
              advance our understanding of whether tropical species rely on similar seasonal
              and endocrine systems as temperate zone birds or whether they have evolved
              different physiological solutions to cope with their environment. Because
              tropical rainforests are disappearing at an alarming rate, detailed knowledge
              of reproductive mechanisms will provide critical baseline information for
              potentially threatened species.
