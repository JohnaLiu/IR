Title:
              Hierarchical Modeling of Vegetation-Climate Interaction and its Impact on
              Tropical Climate Variability

The PIs propose to study how vegetation changes
              with climate in the Sahel. The consequences of this interaction on tropical
              interdecadal/interannual climate variability will also be examined. The PIs
              will use a coupled atmosphere-land-vegetation model of intermediate complexity.
              While GCM sensitivity studies have demonstrated the potential impact on climate
              from land-use change such as deforestation and desertification, the impact of
              naturally varying vegetation on climate variability has received less
              attention.  The work is important because it will increase understanding of
              interactions between vegetation and climate.
