Abstract    :
              Abstract OPP-99-85831 Sedinger   This project is collaborative with the
              University of Alaska and Colorado State University.  It is being funded by the
              Office of Polar Programs, Division of Environmental Biology and Ecology, and
              Ecosystem Studies.  Over the next five years, the Principal Investigators will
              address spatial-temporal variation in plant herbivore interactions and
              associated ecosystem processes in a goose grazing system in coastal tundra of
              the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) Delta, Alaska.  Their fundamental hypothesis is that
              interactions between herbivores and early successional states are tightly
              coupled, such that herbivores require these early successional states for
              successful production of offspring.  Furthermore, herbivores not only maintain,
              but are capable of creating these early successional states by grazing
              associated activities.  Moreover, spatial/temporal complexity in vegetation
              patterns and the response of herbivores to habitat patches introduce
              substantial complexity into succession, ecosystem processes and herbivore
              population dynamics.  The Principal Investigators will examine four
              inter-linked hypotheses: 1) the influence of herbivory on succession; 2) the
              influence of herbivory on nutrient cycling processes; 3) time lags in the
              successional response of vegetation to herbivory; and 4) the role that
              temporal-spatial patterns in herbivory play in determining ecosystem state. 
              This proposal builds on a 16-year study of nutrition and other factors other
              factors on demography of the black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) geese that
              nest on the coast of the Y-K Delta, and on seven years of research on
              vegetation/ ecosystem response to herbivory.  This study takes advantage of a
              large sample of individually marked brant that will provide the team with an
              unprecedented opportunity to measure demographic responses of herbivores to the
              quality and quantity of their food.  Intensive herbivory sophisticated
              experiments on the effects of herbivory on soil processes.  The Principal
              Investigators will use a modified version of a spatial ecosystem model
              (SAVANNA) to test hypotheses what could not otherwise be examined about the
              relationship between spatial patterns of herbivory and ecosystem state. 
              SAVANNA will be directly linked to a goose population model to fully
              incorporate herbivore dynamics into their hypothesis testing, and the field
              experiments are designed to allow them to parameterize SAVANNA for coastal
              tundra.  Modeling will also serve to guide full integration of their field
              experiments and monitoring across trophic levels. The current project also
              will link research on the same population of geese and associated wetland
              habitats in Mexico. This may be the first study to fully integrate dynamics of
              soil processes, vegetation and herbivory in an ecosystem context at such a
              broad spatial scale.
