Abstract    :
              This award provides support for a collaborative study (Universities of Colorado
              and Wyoming) to analyze the isotopic composition (O and H) of 15 years of
              samples collected weekly at 80 sites across the United States, samples
              collected and stored by the National Acid Deposition Program. This new data set
              will increase the existing database of stable isotopes in precipitation in the
              U.S. by about a factor of 200, allowing a better characterization of the basic
              isotope - climate relationships in the U.S. Such information is needed to make
              better use of paleoenvironmental data such as are found in lake sediments, tree
              rings and carbonate deposits. The study will examine both the classic isotope -
              climate relationships such as those with temperature, rainfall amount,
              continentality and elevation, as well as synoptic scale patterns such as
              pressure patterns (i.e. ENSO), storm tracks, long wave patterns, and drought
              and flood patterns.
