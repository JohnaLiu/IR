The construction and commissioning of the Gemini
              telescopes represents an important moment for the U.S. and international
              astronomy communities.  Recording the development of the project is an
              important historical enterprise.  Dr. McCray is interviewing astronomers,
              managers, and engineers involved in the management, constructions, and
              operation of the two Gemini telescopes.  The audience for this work includes
              historians of science, astronomers, science policy makers, and the interested
              public.
