Abstract    :
                This is a CAREER project which requests funding for the deployment,  operation
              and analysis of data from a meridional array of paired  magnetic stations along
              the east coast of the United States at L-  shells from 1.7 to 3.4.  The purpose
              of the array and analysis will  be to investigate processes of energy transfer
              from the solar wind  and magnetotail to the inner magnetosphere.  In addition
              to the  scientific objective of the array called MEASURE, it will become an 
              integral part of the Florida Institute of Technology's Space  Science
              undergraduate curriculum and will be a testbed for a  national high school
              magnetometer network.
