This grant provides support for theoretical research on
              condensed matter physics.  The main objective of the work is to enhance our
              understanding of novel electronic phenomena in condensed matter systems.  The
              research includes investigations of the quantum and statistical mechanics of
              various quantum phases of matter including superfluidity in bilayer quantum
              Hall systems, quantum coherence in mesoscopic devices, quantum magnetism, and
              high-temperature superconductors.  Analytical,  as well as quantum and
              classical Monte Carlo and other numerical, techniques will be applied to the
              study of these phenomena.
