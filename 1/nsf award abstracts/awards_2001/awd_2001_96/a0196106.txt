This research project is concerned with design and analysis of
              numerical methods for hyperbolic systems arising from fluid dynamics,
              chemically reacting flows, and rarefied gas dynamics.  Work will be done on
              three main projects: study of hyperbolic systems with supercharacteristic
              relaxations, development of random projection methods for reacting flows, and
              study of the relaxed Burnett equations for rarefied gas dynamics.  These
              projects will significantly enhance understanding of a variety of important
              physical systems and will provide effective numerical methods for their
              simulation.

With the development of modern computers, high performance
              scientific computation has been playing a central role in scientific
              investigation.  The physical and industrial problems under study here concern
              the behavior of flowing liquids and gasses and are not amenable to solution by
              traditional methods.  Nevertheless, numerical computation is an effective tool
              to obtain very good approximations to the solutions of these problems.  This
              project will advance the ability to utilize high performance computers to solve
              these and other problems of importance.
