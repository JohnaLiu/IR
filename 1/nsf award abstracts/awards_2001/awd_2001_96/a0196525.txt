Abstract    :
              
Professor Michael Pishko will develop biosensor arrays based on highly ordered
              polymeric films containing biorecognition molecules. Rod-coil block copolymers
              will self-assemble on electrode surfaces. They will include segments that
              permit UV-initiated cross-linking and other segments that permit electron
              transfer from an immobilized enzyme such as glucose oxidase to the electrode
              surface. The investigator will study the effects of polymer structure on
              self-assembly, cluster formation, and electron transfer through the films using
              experimental and molecular modeling techniques. He will develop methods for
              immobilizing biorecognition molecules on those films and patterning them on
              surfaces using mid-UV photolithography to form sensor arrays. Future potential
              clinical and biomedical applications are envisioned. The educational plan
              includes the development of two new courses in materials for undergraduate and
              graduate students; summer research mentoring of undergraduate students; and a
              mentoring program for female high-school students.
