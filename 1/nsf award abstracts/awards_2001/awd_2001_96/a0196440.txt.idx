Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT DMS-0070823  Under this grant, Stefanov plans to work in two areas:
              (1) Inverse Problems and (2) Resonances (scattering poles). In the area of
              Inverse Problems, he plans to study some inverse problems for partial
              differential equations and related inverse problems in geometry. Some of the
              problems of interest are inverse problems in anisotropic media.
              Mathematically, they lead to problems of recovering a Riemannian metric from
              boundary data or scattering data. One example is the inverse kinematic
              problem, where one has to recover a Riemannian metric in a bounded domain from
              the lengths of geodesics connecting each two boundary points. This problem has
              natural applications in geophysics and is closely connected to the inverse
              problem of recovering a metric from the associated hyperbolic
              Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) map on the boundary. The PI plans to study this
              problem for larger classes of metrics than already known and to prove also
              stability estimates. The related linearized problem - recovery of tensors from
              integrals along geodesics will also be studied. The PI will also work on the
              (elliptic) anisotropic inverse boundary value problem. The possibility of
              developing an abstract approach to obtaining conditional stability estimates
              will be also studied and the PI plans to find sufficient conditions that would
              guarantee that one can derive a stability estimate (and therefore uniqueness)
              directly from the injectivity of the linearized problem. The PI will also
              conduct research in the area of resonances (scattering poles). The PI plans to
              study some physical systems where one can construct non-real quasimodes and to
              show that those quasimodes are close to resonances not converging to the real
              axis. Two such systems are the transmission problem and scattering by a
              strictly convex obstacle.  The motivation for this project comes from its
              possible applications. Inverse Problems have numerous applications to geology,
              medicine, non-destructive evaluation of materials, etc. The anisotropic
              inverse problems are related to recovering parameters of media with properties
              (conductivity, wave speed, etc.) depending not only on the position but also
              on the direction. Conditional stability estimates show that small changes of
              the parameters of the system lead to small changes in the measured data under
              additional assumptions usually requiring sufficient smoothness of the
              coefficients. This demonstrates that the corresponding inverse problem is
              conditionally well-posed. Resonances arise naturally as resonance frequencies
              for systems in unbounded domains. They correspond to peaks in the measured
              data. For some systems, we plan to describe the asymptotic distribution of the
              resonances in some neighborhood of the real axis, which provides computational
              and qualitative tools for understanding those systems.
