Abstract    :
              9808197  Cook  The Rhizobium-legume symbiosis constitutes one of the major
              sources of reduced nitrogen in the biosphere.  This relationship culminates in
              symbiotic nitrogen fixation within a specialized organ, termed a "nodule", that
              develops on the plant root.  Several lines of evidence indicate that the plant
              controls symbiotic activity by regulating the number of nodules that form on
              the plant root.    Recently, the PI's laboratory has identified two plant genes
              that are required for appropriate control of nodule number.  Mutations in these
              genes result in an approximately 10-fold increase in the number of nodules on
              the plant root.  Genetic analyses indicate that these mutants, named
              "supernumerary" (sun) and "sickle" (skl), represent separate, unlinked genes
              that may act independently to control nodule number.    Research under this
              grant will further examine the nature of these mutants with the goal of
              understanding how the host plant regulates symbiotic development.  The specific
              objectives of this research include (1) developing a frame work genetic pathway
              for nodulation involving sun, skl and other nodulation mutants, (2) examining
              the probable role of sun and skl in plant hormone perception, and (3) to map
              and clone the sun and skl genes.
