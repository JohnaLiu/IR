Abstract    :
              This award is for a stable isotopic study of ferricrete deposits in the Rocky
              Mountains of the western United States. The purpose of this study is to
              understand the nature of climate change during the current interglacial in the
              Rocky Mountains. The primary importance of this study is the investigation of
              rapid climate change (last 10,000 years) in high alpine catchments which should
              be sensitive to local and regional climate perturbations. This project makes
              use of variations in oxygen isotope ratios of goethite from ferricretes through
              time. Ferricrete deposits are found throughout the American west in areas of
              naturally acidic waters, typically near sulfide-rich rocks. These ferricrete
              deposits consist of goethite-cemented stream sediments that can be meters thick
              and which entombed datable wood fragments. The investigator's previous research
              has shown that ferricretes are an important new climate indicator which is
              useful in terrestrial, mountainous areas where few other climate proxies
              currently exist.
