              Abstract  Award:  DMS-9970284 Principal Investigator:  Lei Ni  The
              principal investigator propose to study the interplay between geometry and
              analysis on complete Kahler manifolds. The focus will be the linear and
              nonlinear analysis on complete Kahler manifolds under various curvature
              conditions. The main goal is to understand the spaces of holomorphic functions
              (and sections of certain holomorphic bundles) on complete Kahler manifolds
              under various curvature assumptions and apply the properties of these various
              spaces to the study of the geometry and topology of complete Kahler manifolds
              with various curvature conditions, in particular, the uniformization of
              complete Kahler manifolds with positive bisectional curvature.  The subject
              of the PI's investigation belongs to fields called differential geometry and
              global analysis on manifolds. Differential geometry is the study of the
              relationship between the geometry of a space (a manifold in the language
              of differential geometry) and analytic concepts defined on the space. Global
              analysis is the study of the overall geometric and topological properties of a
              space by piecing together local information. Since the space is usually a
              curved space, the term ``curvature'' is introduced to measure the deviation
              from the Euclidean space, which is flat. Applications of these areas
              of mathematics in other sciences include the structure of complicated
              molecules, liquid-gas boundaries, and the large scale structure of the
              universe. A Kahler manifold is a complex space which has an extra structure
              called Kahler structure. The geometric and analytic properties of Kahler
              manifolds are important to various fields of mathematics and physics such
              as low dimensional topology, algebraic geometry and superstring theory.
