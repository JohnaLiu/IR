Abstract    :
                9730147  Anderson      This project will use U/Th and 14C dating in corals
              dredged from  intermediate depths of the Atlanti Ocean to identify changes in 
              ventilation rate during the last glacial and deglacial intervals.   The
              difference between the 14C date and the U/Th date of a sample  can determine
              the age of the water in which the coral lived, after  correction for
              radiocarbon porduction and reservoir effects.   Differences in water age
              reflect differences in source of the  water, and therefore can constrain
              circulation changes related to  climatic states.
