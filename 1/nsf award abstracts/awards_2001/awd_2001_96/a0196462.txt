Abstract    :
              
The PI proposes to develop a structural model of the subduction thrust from
              the seaward edge of the subduction zone through the seismogenic zone with the
              geological conditions at the Nankai Subduction Zone as a constraint. The
              objective is to understand the progressive fabric development across the
              aseismic to seismic transition, to provide information that will help interpret
              geophysical images and guide experimental lab studies and assist in the
              interpreting of the drill hole data through the seismogenic zone. The PI will
              use ODP holes at the frontal part of the Nankai subduction zone and uplifted
              equivalent complexes on land.
