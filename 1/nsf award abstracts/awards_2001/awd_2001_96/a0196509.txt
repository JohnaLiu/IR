Abstract    :
              9876070 Baum This career development plan focuses on phylogenetics, the
              reconstruction and interpretation of the historical record of organisms.  The
              research component is a study of historical relationships among the core
              Malvales, a group of approximately 3000 plants including such economically
              important species as cotton, chocolate, okra, durian, balsa, and jute.  The
              teaching component involves courses at the college level and a workshop for
              high school teachers on phylogeny as a framework for teaching biological
              diversity.
	The DNA sequence of five genes for representatives of Malvales
              will be determined.  By comparing and analyzing these sequences and integrating
              information from plant morphology and paleontology, it will be possible to
              estimate historical relationships within the group.  This will help clarify the
              timing and geographic context for the origin and radiation of core Malvales, as
              well as the historical mechanisms underlying floral diversity and pollination
              mechanisms in the group.
	Courses taught will include one undergraduate course
              (Biological Diversity) and two graduate courses.  An intensive workshop for
              teachers will be taught through the Center for Innovation in Urban Education,
              Northeastern University: The Tree of Life: Phylogeny as a Foundation for the
              Teaching of Organismic Biology.  This will introduce teachers to phylogenetic
              trees using case studies (e.g., origin of whales, HIV phylogeny, origin of
              birds), debates (e.g., "life, by definition, exists only on earth";
              "conservation is a phylogenetic problem"), and a hands-on project using skull
              characters to reconstruct history of the carnivores.  We will also discuss how
              to bring these ideas into classrooms so as to improve biological literacy at
              the high school level.
