A CAREER award will address specific problems in
              Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). The research component will focus on
              development of an experimentally verified thermodynamic field formulation for
              anodic bonding, as it is used in MEMS.  The education component will develop a
              rigorous graduate-level continuum physics curriculum for MEMS design and
              fabrication.  MEMS components are made using material removal methods such as
              etching, and material addition methods such as vapor deposition, evaporation,
              sputtering, and electroplating. In addition, MEMS are often joined and packaged
              using anodic and/or eutectic bonding. Current microfabrication textbooks
              provide either an overly elementary introduction to these processes or a highly
              detailed treatment of the non-continuum physics; there is nothing available to
              cover the middle ground, as planned here. Students will formulate the equations
              for conservation of mass, energy, and momentum, as well as the second law of
              thermodynamics for evolving microstructures, including reaction, diffusion,
              creep, and moving surfaces and lines. The education will be integrated with the
              research and the analytical models developed will be validated by experiments
              performed in the 3,000 sq.ft. clean room of the Microfabrication Applications
              laboratory.
