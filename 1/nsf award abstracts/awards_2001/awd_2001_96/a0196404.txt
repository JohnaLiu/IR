              Educational Innovation:  Radically Rethinking CS1

This CISE Educational
              Innovation (EI) proposal requests funds for the development and dissemination
              of an introductory computer science course based on the idea that computation
              is made up of concurrent interacting entities.  At present, most CS1 courses
              are based on Turing's and Von Neumann's models of sequential execution, i.e.
              computation as a sequence of steps executed by a CPU.  However, these models no
              longer describe modern systems like servers, operating systems, and robots. 
              Systems like these are judged by their ongoing interactions rather than their
              end results.  Their constituent parts are conceptually contemporaneous entities
              rather than rigidly sequenced steps.  The transition to Java in many CS
              curricula provides an excellent leverage point for the proposed approach to
              CS1.  The proposed project has the potential to dramatically change the way
              that CS1 is taught and the way that students think about computer science.
