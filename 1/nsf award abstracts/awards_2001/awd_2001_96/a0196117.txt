Abstract    :
                9730554  Klinger    The project is for a modeling study of the thermohaline 
              circulation.  It is an extension of a previous study in a  single Atlantic-like
              ocean basin to global oceans with a  nonlinear equation of state.  A
              primitive-equation model  will be used, and the behavior of the system will be 
              explored with several configurations.  Conceptual/analytical  models will be
              formulated to explain the numerical results.
