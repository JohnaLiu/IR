Abstract    :
              Chloroplasts are the subcellular organelles of plants that convert light energy
              from the sun into biologically usable form and generate the atmospheric oxygen
              without which life as we know it on earth today could not exist.  The vital
              chemical reaction catalyzed by the enzymes in the chloroplasts is the combining
              of carbon dioxide with water and energy to produce glucose plus molecular
              oxygen.  The glucose is then used by the plant (and any animal that eats the
              plant) as an energy-rich food that can be utilized either directly or
              indirectly to fuel metabolism.  The compartmentation of chloroplast proteins
              within the multiply membrane-bounded chloroplast is intrinsically critical to
              its function.  Since most of the chloroplast proteins, including the
              light-harvesting enzymes, are manufactured in the cytoplasm, the cells have
              evolved a complex mechanism for transporting these proteins to their proper
              places in the chloroplast.  In higher plants, the chloroplasts contain two
              envelope membranes, and although not all the details are worked out, there is
              already a good deal known about the protein translocation machineries in higher
              plant chloroplasts.  However, in certain algal cells, the chloroplasts contain
              three or even four envelope membranes.  Far less is understood about how
              proteins are translocated into these so-called complex chloroplasts. 
              Understanding the biogenesis of complex chloroplasts has important implications
              for evolution as well as for our understanding of fundamental mechanisms of
              eukaryotic protein targetting in general.  This project has as its long term
              goal the understanding of protein targetting and translocation to the complex
              chloroplasts of the unicellular alga Euglena.     Eukaryotic cells target and
              translocate proteins to specific subcellular compartments in ways that differ
              from one compartment to another in their details; however, there are some
              general themes, such as the presence of specific targeting sequences in the
              protein, that are common to all these processes.  Generally, chloroplast
              protein precursors have an N-terminal presequence, the transit peptide,
              containing information required for post-translational import into
              chloroplasts.  Precursors to both stromal and thylakoid proteins contain a
              functionally similar transit peptide that targets the precursor to the stroma
              through a general import pathway. Protein translocation into the endoplasmic
              reticulum (ER) is usually co-translational and dependent upon an N-terminal
              presequence, the signal peptide. Integral membrane proteins contain hydrophobic
              stop transfer membrane anchor sequences that stop translocation, anchoring the
              protein within the membrane.  Proteins destined for other intracellular
              compartments are transported in vesicles from the ER to the Golgi apparatus,
              sorted in the Golgi apparatus and packaged in transport vesicles for transfer
              to their final intracellular location.    Euglena chloroplasts contain 3
              envelope membranes.  Stromal and thylakoid proteins are transported in vesicles
              as integral membrane proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus to the
              outermost plastid envelope membrane, rather than directly from the cytoplasm to
              chloroplast.  All Euglena chloroplast protein presequences are 140 amino acids
              in length with a similar structure composed of a N-terminal signal peptide and
              a second hydrophobic domain 60 amino acids from the signal peptidase cleavage
              site.  This second hydrophobic domain anchors the protein in the membrane with
              the presequence N-terminus inside the microsomal lumen and the  C-terminus on
              the cytoplasmic membrane face. A Euglena precursor was imported into pea
              chloroplasts indicating that the  Euglena presequence contains a transit
              peptide recognized by the higher plant import machinery. The Euglena
              intermediate and inner envelope should contain proteins homologous to
              components of the plant envelope import apparatus that interact with the
              transit peptide.  Euglena plastid envelope proteins have not been
              characterized.  The most novel targeting region of the Euglena presequence, the
              Golgi to chloroplast targeting sequence, is also unidentified.  	  The first
              objective of this project is to develop procedures to isolate the Euglena
              chloroplast envelope and identify Euglena chloroplast envelope proteins that
              are part of the protein import apparatus.  Advantage will be taken of the fact
              that two plant envelope proteins, Toc 34 and Toc159, that interact with the
              transit peptide are GTP binding proteins.  This biochemical property will be
              used to isolate the Euglena Toc homologues.  Peptide sequence will be obtained
              and used to design degenerate primers for cDNA isolation by PCR.   Isolation of
              the cDNAs represents the first step toward characterization of the Euglena
              envelope import apparatus.  The second objective is to develop a Euglena
              transformation system that can be used to identify the Golgi to chloroplast
              targeting domain and the chloroplast import (transit peptide)  domains in the
              Euglena chloroplast protein precursor presequence.  The Sh ble gene encoding
              zeocin resistance fused to the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of the Euglena
              LHCPII gene will be used as a positive selectable marker allowing optimization
              of transformation conditions by electroporation or biolistic transformation. 
              Cells will be co-transformed with the Sh ble gene and precursor-GFP fusion
              protein presequence deletion constructs.  Zeocin resistant cells will be
              screened by fluorescence microscopy for GFP expression and confocal microscopy
              will be used for an initial determination of intracellular localization. The
              precursor-GFP fusion proteins will contain the Euglena stromal polyprotein
              processing peptidase cleavage site so that upon chloroplast import, GFP will be
              released from the fusion protein providing a simple biochemical assay (western
              blotting) to confirm import.   The third objective is to identify the ancestral
              function of the Euglena presequence domains by using confocal microscopy to
              determine the intracellular localization of precursor-GFP fusion protein
              presequence deletion constructs in mammalian cells.
