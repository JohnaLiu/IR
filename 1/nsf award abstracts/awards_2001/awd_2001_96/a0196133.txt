Abstract    :
                Ingall   9730159    The importance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in marine
              organic carbon cycling is now widely recognized.  The essential nutrient
              phosphorus in DOM is potentially a significant source of P for algal and
              microbial metabolism, however little is known about the chemical composition
              and cycling of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP).  The PI, Ingall, proposes to
              study the chemical composition and structure of DOP and particulate OP in the
              coastal and open oceans.  Efforts will be focused on that fraction of the DOP
              pool that is isolated with a tangential-flow ultrafilter, and hence is expected
              to represent the colloidal or high molecular weight fraction of DOP.  Samples
              will be obtained from previously collected and newly collected field samples,
              as well as from controlled laboratory culturing and decomposition experiments. 
              These samples will be analyzed using newly developed 31P NMR techniques.  The
              results of this study are expected to lead to the quantification and
              identification of organic P compounds, and are thus an important step in
              gaining a more complete understanding of P cycling in the oceans.    Ingall
