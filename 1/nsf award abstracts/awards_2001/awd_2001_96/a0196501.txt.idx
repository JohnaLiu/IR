Abstract    :
              0089575 Musfeldt  This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              in materials research involves Janice L. Musfeldt and her group at the State
              University of New York in Binghamton and Alexandre Revcolevschi and his group
              at the Universite Paris XI.  Their collaboration is aimed at investigations of
              growth and spectroscopic response of lightly doped CuGeO3
              (copper-germanium-oxygen) crystals as a function of temperature and high
              magnetic field.  The US group brings to this collaboration expertise in
              far-infrared spectroscopy.  This is complemented by the French investigator's
              expertise in crystal growth.  He will be responsible for growth of lightly
              substituted single crystals using the floating zone technique.  Experiments at
              the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida will be
              carried out jointly.  This award represents the US side of a joint proposal
              to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF
              will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigators and
              graduate students.  The CNRS will support the visits of French researchers to
              the United States. The collaboration will advance fundamental understanding of
              novel magnetic materials (CuGeO3) which have similarities to the
              superconducting copper oxides and other doped transition metal oxides.  The
              work will be of general interest to the solid state materials community.
