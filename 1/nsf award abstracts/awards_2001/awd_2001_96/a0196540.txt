Abstract    :
              Dr. David W. Wright, Department of Chemistry, Duquesne University is supported
              by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of the
              Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work under a Career
              Award whose principal focus is the development of functional interfaces for
              inorganic nanostructures. Specifically, the main objective is the use of
              synthetic combinatorial approaches to design, synthesize and characterize a
              "molecular toolbox" of scaffolds for the synthesis of new materials inspired by
              biomineralization processes. Following the multidisciplinary nature of the
              research activities, the award also supports development of an integrated
              laboratory concept for upper-class undergraduates and a practicum for first
              year graduate students.

To the extent that this multidisciplinary research
              cuts across such fields as material science, the environment, chemistry,
              biology and nanotechnology, graduate students and post-doctoral associates will
              be trained in diversified disciplines and sub-disciplines. The integrated
              laboratory concept and the pedagogical goal to have students "think with their
              heads and do with their hands" will provide undergraduate and graduate students
              with basic skills and a philosophy that will expose them to innovative
              approaches for independent research.
