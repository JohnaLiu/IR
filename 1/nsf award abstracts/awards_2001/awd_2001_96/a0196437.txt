Abstract    :
              9988597
The nature of the transition from the nanoscale to the continuum will
              be specifically examined in an effort to obtain a quasi-continuum formulation.
              Many thin-film/substrate systems initially grow in a two-dimensional (2D) or
              atomically flat mode but eventually undergo a roughening transition, yielding
              three-dimensional (3D) islands on the top of the 2D layers. A research program
              that combines theory and numerical simulations is planned. Its goal is to
              obtain a quantitatively accurate picture of the elastic field in the vicinity
              of surface defects and their elastic interactions.  It is necessary that the
              problem be addressed at both the continuum and atomic (discrete) scale.  The
              predictions of continuum models should be accurate, as long as the distance
              between defects remains sufficiently large (long-range interaction).  As the
              separation distance between interacting defects diminishes, the
              atomic/continuum approaches diverge and the necessity of a lattice model
              becomes apparent.  The short-range interaction of defects cannot be determined
              without a discrete elastic model.
