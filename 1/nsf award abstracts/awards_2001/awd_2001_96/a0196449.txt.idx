Abstract    :
              Montgomery Reiners 0087413 0087318 The Washington Cascades cast one of the
              largest climatic rain shadows in North America, with mean annual precipitation
              in some areas on the west side higher than 4 m/yr, and on the east side lower
              than 0.15 m/yr. We are studying the temporal relationships between
              mountain-building and climate in this regional setting by using a combined
              approach of low-temperature apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronometry in the Cascades
              crystalline rocks themselves, and stable isotope variations in authigenic
              minerals in clays and carbonates in paleosols of different ages on the dry,
              east side of the range. In addition, through combined GIS and He dating work,
              we are examining the relationship between creation of Cascades topographic
              relief and Pleistocene-to-recent glaciation in the range, and evaluating the
              role of relatively recent erosional forces on orogenic exhumation. Our
              preliminary work indicates that He ages record much younger ages than other
              radiometric systems in the Cascades, suggesting a relatively recent (late
              Miocene at the earliest) period of exhumation, which is consistent with
              paleontological evidence from eastern Washington for the lack of a severe
              climate contrast until this time.
