Abstract    :
              Abstract 0074058  This project will investigate material and symbolic aspects
              of domestic food distribution among Samburu (Kenya) pastoralists under
              conditions of chronic scarcity.  Seasonal and cyclical scarcity have shaped
              many aspects of Samburu life, including key aspects of gender and age-based
              roles and identities; in recent years scarcity has increased with decline of
              the pastoral economy and population growth. Previous research has suggested
              that women and junior males suffer disproportionately during famines in
              pastoral societies dominated by senior males. This research hypothesizes,
              however, that various aspects of Samburu society, in particular the manner in
              which the domestic domain is female centered and the nature of Samburu gender
              roles and identities, mitigate the power of elders to have differential access
              to nutritional resources. Methods include the collection of nutritional data in
              collaboration with a Kenyan nutritionist, as well as a demographic/economic
              survey of the community, structured interviews, and the analysis of household
              food distribution patterns. This project will contribute to our understanding
              of gendered dynamics within pastoral societies and to development policy
              planning directed towards famine relief in various parts of the world.
