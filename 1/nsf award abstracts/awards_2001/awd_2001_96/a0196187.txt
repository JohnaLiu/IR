Abstract    :
              This project addresses several fundamental questions in
algebraic geometry and
              number theory.
The first part concerns the geometry of solutions to
algebraic
              equations.
Let X be a variety defined over a number field K.
Does there exist
              a finite extension L/K such that
X(L) is dense?  One seeks criteria for when
              this
occurs in terms of the geometry of X.
It is still not clear what form
              such criteria should take.  
The second part concerns the geometry of plane
              curves.
When is an abstract curve a degeneration
of smooth plane curves? 
              What geometric properties do
such limiting plane curves have in common?
The
              third part involves the classification of surface
singularities.  Given a
              family of projective normal
surfaces, when are the invariants of such a
              family
constant?  Specifically, how does one tell whether
the
              self-intersection of the canonical divisor 
is constant?  The last part
              involves finding explicit
parametrizations for the curves of a fixed small
              genus.

Algebraic geometers study the structure of solutions to
polynomial
              equations.  From ancient times, geometric
figures like circles and ellipses
              have fascinated 
architects, scientists, and artists.  The most compact
way
              to represent such a figure is to describe it as the 
solutions to an equation.
               One basic question is 
to classify the abstract figures that may be
              represented
by equations of a given form.  Another is to understand
the
              common geometric properties of the solutions to
all the equations of a given
              form.  This project seeks
to answer these questions for special types of
              curves 
and surfaces.
