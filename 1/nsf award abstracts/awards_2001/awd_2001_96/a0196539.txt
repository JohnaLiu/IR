Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funds to support an exploratory effort to determine the
              paleoclimatic potential of Dew Lake, a site near the forest-steppe boundary in
              the Wind River Mountains, Wyoming. The site is also just outside of the late
              Wisconsinan glacial maximum. For these reasons, it is an ideal site to monitor
              climatic and vegetational changes through the last glacial maximum. Preliminary
              data from the early 1960's suggest that the lake sediments extend to 19,000 14C
              years or more. It is difficult to judge the reliability of the early data, so
              the lake needs to be re-cored and dated with modern methods. Continuous
              lacustrine sediment sequences outside the margin of the last glacial maximum
              and extending through the time of that advance are extremely rare and valuable.
