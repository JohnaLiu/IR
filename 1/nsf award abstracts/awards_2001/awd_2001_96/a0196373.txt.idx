Abstract    :
              9511090  Blank    There has long been substantial interest in the relationship 
              between movements in the macroeconomy and changes in the economic  behavior and
              well-being of low-income populations.  In  particular, a growing research
              literature has investigated the  relationship between poverty, inequality, and
              aggregate economic   growth.  Less studied has been the relationship between
              economic   growth and the use of public assistance programs.  Recent trends  
              indicate the value of such research, however.  Public assistance   caseloads
              exploded in the early 1990s.  While at first this was  ascribed to the economic
              slowdown and the rise in unemployment,  the increase in program participation
              was unduly large relative  to the magnitude of unemployment changes, and
              caseloads did not  fall rapidly once unemployment began to decline.  his
              project  studies the determinants of public assistance caseloads and  benefit
              expenditures over time, bringing together the literature   focusing on
              individual decisions to participate in public  assistance, and the literature
              that investigates the role of the   macroeconomy on poverty and inequality.   
              This project will focus on four primary questions:   How are public assistance
              caseloads and benefit expenditures    related to macroeconomic movements and
              how has this changed    over time?  How have changing demographics among
              low-income families affected    these trends?   1.   How have changes in
              program eligibility and benefit rules       impacted public assistance usage? 
              2.   How do these three factors relate to changes in eligibility        versus
              changes in take-up rates among the eligible?
