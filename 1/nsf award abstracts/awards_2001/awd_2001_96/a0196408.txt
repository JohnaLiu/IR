This is an instrument acquisition award to State University
              of New York at Binghamton. The overall goal of this project is to set up a
              near-millimeter and far-infrared spectrometer, a dedicated high-sensitivity
              detector for the spectrometer, and the associated accessories for temperature
              dependent measurements over the frequency range of the instrument. Acquisition
              of this spectrometer will impact on-going programs in magnetic oxides,
              fullerene polymers, molecular magnets, and organic superconductors. It will
              also provide an important experimental compliment for the other spectroscopic
              capabilities that currently exist in my lab. In addition to supporting the
              low-energy spectroscopy of the aforementioned novel electronic and magnetic
              materials, the equipment will aid in the training of undergraduate, graduate,
              and postdoctoral students in the area of materials spectroscopy.
