TITLE:  Mediating Careers: The Role of Labor Market Intermediaries in
              Facilitating in the Entry, Retention, and Advancement of Women and Minorities
              in the Information Technology Workforce

This CISE Information Technology
              Workforce (ITW) proposal requests funds to explore the role of labor market
              intermediaries (LMIs) in facilitating the entry, retention, and advancement of
              women and minorities in the IT workforce.  The project builds upon previous
              work by the research team that shows the considerable success of non-profit
              LMIs in placing economically disadvantage women and minorities into IT
              occupations.  The study targets women and minorities in IT occupations who come
              from five broad educational groups: four-year college degree programs, two-year
              college degree programs, short-term public or private job training programs,
              graduate degree programs, and high school education.  The study focuses, in
              particular, on the new community-based institutions and community colleges
              engaging in workforce development.  Because these programs target disadvantaged
              adults, they are placing a disproportionately large share of underrepresented
              minorities into occupations.  This project has the potential to provide
              valuable insights about the recruitment, retention, and advancement of women
              and underrepresented minorities in IT careers.
