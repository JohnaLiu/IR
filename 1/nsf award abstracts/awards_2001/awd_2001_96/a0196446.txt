In this project, the PI plans to obtain new experimental
              data on the lattice preferred orientation in olivine-rich rocks with an
              emphasis on two issues:  (1)  the influence of high water-fugacity and (2) the
              influence of complicated deformation history.  The investigators will use a
              newly developed high-temperature, high--pressure, simple--shear deformation
              technique combined with a newly installed EBSP (Electron back scattered
              pattern) facility for preferred orientation measurements.  Deformation
              experiments will be conducted at P=2 GPa and T=1500-1600K, where water fugacity
              is more than 100 times higher than the conditions so far explored by a gas
              apparatus.  The results will provide us with a new data set to interpret
              complicated patterns of seismic anisotropy in the subduction-zone upper mantle
              in terms of flow geometry and distribution of water.
