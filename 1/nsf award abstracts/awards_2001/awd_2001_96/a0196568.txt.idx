Abstract    :
              This award to Professor Kermit Murray of Emory University entitled "Infrared
              Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (IR-MALDI)" is
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  The goals of the
              research are to address fundamental problems in the understanding of IR-MALDI. 
              The research will study wavelength dependence of threshold fluences, ion yields
              and average initial ion velocities.  The investigator will utilize  unique
              two-pulse laser experiments to provide more information and better
              differentiation between the desorption and ionization processes.  In addition
              the research will include novel applicationssuch as tissue microdissection in
              conjunction with IR-MALDI and the use of ice matricies for the study of
              non-covalent complexes.  The principle investigator is recognized for his
              contributions to the community through his widely available internet resources.
              This research has the potential for high impact in the areas of molecular and
              cellular biology, as well as, in mass spectrometry.
