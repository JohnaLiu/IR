Digital Government: 
              Internet Voting Study

This is an award to support a 2-day workshop on the
              topic of Internet or electronic voting.  This topic has been of increasing
              interest as States, municipalities and political parties are more seriously
              considering this possibility.  The workshop will focus primarily on the
              technical issues and concerns associated with electronic voting, but will be
              informed by social scientists, private concerns, non-profit organizations and
              others with viewpoints and experience in the topic area in developing a
              research agenda for electronic voting.  The workshop will occur in early
              September 2000 and a report should be completed in November 2000.
