Abstract    :
              9730025  Hansell    In this study, researcher at the Bermuda Biological Station 
              will perform empirical analyses of the principal processes  that control the
              partitioning of carbon in the surface layer  of the ocean in order to improve
              model parameterizations of  the oceanic carbon cycle. Specific processes to be
              evaluated  included the export of carbon from the surface layer as  particulate
              organic and inorganic carbon, the production and  accumulation of organic
              carbon in the surface layer, and the  air-sea exchange of carbon dioxide. The
              analytical approach  taken will be largely one of mass balance of carbon and 
              nitrogen in the upper layer of the ocean.  Carbon  partitioning at US JGOFS
              process and time-series sites will  be studied in the early phase of the
              project, while  extrapolation of the findings at the JGOFS sites to the  ocean
              basin and global scale will take place in the later  phase of the project.  In
              the latter analysis, data from the  Global CO2 survey and the NOAA OACES lines
              will be used to  investigate basin wide expressions of carbon partitioning. 
              The work will lead to significant improvements in the  oceanographic
              community's modeling of the marine carbon  cycle.
