Abstract    :
              Computer display technology over the past twenty years has been dominated by
              two-dimensional display systems. Computer graphics techniques during this time
              have therefore concentrated on exploiting the potential of those displays.
              However, recent breakthroughs in volumetric (three-dimensional) display
              technologies promise to revolutionize computer display of information and user
              interaction. In particular, crossed-beam displays can now produce true
              three-dimensional "glass" images that can be simultaneously viewed from almost
              any direction. However, there are many challenges that must be addressed in
              order for these systems to reach their full potential. This project will
              develop flexible, extensible software architectures, data encoding methods,
              rendering and visualization techniques, and new human-computer interaction
              paradigms to fully exploit the capabilities of volumetric displays. These
              techniques will be tested on a 4-inch cubic volumetric display provided to NASA
              by 3D Technology Laboratories, Inc.
