This grant provides three years of salary for a stable
              isotope technical support person at Dartmouth College.  The scientist to be
              hired for this position will: 1) maintain the two gas isotope ratio mass
              spectrometers and their attachments; 2) assist in developing new techniques in
              continuous flow mass spectrometry; 3) train undergraduate and graduate students
              in the use of the laboratory; and 4) generate their own independent research
              projects.  We envision that the stable isotope technical support person will
              significantly enhance the research and teaching efforts of the stable isotope
              group at Dartmouth College.  In particular, we are interested in hiring a
              person who will assist in all aspects of the ongoing and future
              interdisciplinary projects; such as paleoclimatic; ecological, and geologic
              studies.
