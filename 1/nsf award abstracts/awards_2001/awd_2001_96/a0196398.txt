Abstract    :
              PI:David Ingerman  DMS-9801710    This project is concerned with discrete and
              continuous inverse  boundary problems. These are the problems of obtaining
              information about a   surface or a graph, given some measurements on the
              boundary of  the object, and the problems of characterizing possible boundary
              measurements.   An example of such a problem would be the recovering of
              conductivity (or genus)   of a surface given its Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (the
              map from boundary   potential to current). Our results show that the graphs can
              provide an   efficient way for computer modeling of continuous medium behavior.
                We are also interested in approximation of solutions   of continuous inverse
              boundary problems by the discrete ones.      The main subject of this project
              is understanding of the connection between   continuous and discrete inverse
              boundary problems. These are problems of   obtaining information about interior
              structure of a body from some   measurements made on its surface. The problems
              take their  origin in the oil exploration industry from attempts to
              non-invasively determine  earth deep structure by inducing and measuring
              electromagnetic fields on the   surface. We made a good progress in
              understanding of the discretized versions   of the problem. Our goals in this
              project are modeling of continuous medium   behavior using the discrete analogs
              and approximation of solutions   of continuous inverse boundary problems by the
              discrete ones.
