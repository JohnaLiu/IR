Abstract    :
              Considerable attention has focused in recent years on research examining
              interactions between the atmosphere and tropical oceans, particularly the
              Pacific, where the El Nino/Southern Oscillation originates.  Related research
              has examined how temperature fluctuations in tropical waters affect climatic
              variability around the globe.  Far less attention has been given to the
              dynamics and climatic consequences of comparable ocean-atmosphere interactions
              in mid- and high-latitude seas.  This study examines spatial teleconnection
              patterns and temporal oscillatory characteristics, especially at decadal time
              scales, of the associations between sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies
              over the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and winter snow accumulation in Russia. 
              The motivation for this study is recently revealed evidence that a large share
              of land-surface warming can be attributed to decadal and longer time
              scale-variations in sea-surface temperatures.  A combination of advanced
              statistical methods will be used to analyze historical snow-depth records for
              Russia in combination with records of Atlantic and Pacific SSTs.  Statistical
              approaches to be used include principal component analysis, singular spectrum
              analysis, multi-channel singular spectrum analysis, and singular value
              decomposition analysis.  This study will identify geographic regions and time
              scales of teleconnections between Russian snow depth and SSTs over the two
              oceans.  Atmospheric circulation anomaly patterns bridging the teleconnections
              with each ocean also will be examined.  The proposed study will help answer
              questions regarding how SSTs influence regional climate in high latitudes and
              at what time scales.  The project also will enhance our understanding of the
              potential causes for snow increases over the high latitudes in recent decades
              and should enhance the predictability of climate variations and hydrological
              phenomena in Eurasia.
