Abstract    :
              9807316  Paulay    We will generate a robust, complete phylogeny using two
              mitochondrial genes (COI and 16S) for a well documented and  diverse group of
              marine gastropods, the cowries.  This phylogeny will  establish the patterns of
              speciation and test hypotheses of  diversification by establishing the relative
              importance of different  arenas and speciation mechanisms. Cowries are an ideal
              group for testing  speciation processes in the Indo-West Pacific because 1.)
              they are  extremely diverse; there are 148 extant species of Indo-West Pacific 
              cowries that have been derived from 15 independent lineages, one of which  has
              given rise to 69 species since the Miocene, 2.) they have a good  fossil
              record, 3.) their geographic ranges are well-documented, 4.) many  sister
              species still retain non-overlapping distributions, 5.) geographic  variation
              is common within many species, and 6.) an initial phylogeny is  already in
              hand.  Cowries epitomize the large and rapid evolutionary  radiations that so
              characterize the Indo-West Pacific.  The proposed work  will be the first major
              molecular phylogenetic attempt to analyze patterns  of speciation in this most
              diverse marine region, and, as it is in a group  of organisms with great
              phylogeographic power, it promises to test  numerous hypotheses about Indo-West
              Pacific biogeography and  diversification.
