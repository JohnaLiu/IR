Abstract    :
              As networking and multimedia technologies continue to advance new video-based
              applications such as digital libraries and video-on-demand services will become
              increasingly more common, requiring the efficient network transmission of
              compressed stored video streams. For constant-quality video streams, however,
              the efficient allocation of network resources is complicated by several
              factors.  First, compressed digital video data has much larger bandwidth
              requirements than textual data, and hence, place much larger bandwidth
              requirements on the network.  Second, compressed digital video data can exhibit
              significant burstiness in bandwidth requirements at multiple time scales. In
              particular, stored video content will typically be much more complex than
              "live" videoconference type video streams, resulting in much greater long-term
              burstiness. Finally, due to the continuous nature of digital video, stringent
              guarantees on network jitter and delay may be required (especially for
              live-video transmission).  To efficiently allocate network resources for the
              delivery of compressed video streams, bandwidth-smoothing techniques have been
              introduced to take advantage of a priori information that may be available for
              a video stream.  The bandwidth smoothing techniques that have been presented
              thus far have not considered the interactions of bandwidth smoothing algorithms
              with network delivery mechanism. The proposed research will address the
              integration of bandwidth smoothing techniques into current networking
              mechanisms in two key areas:  1.  Bandwidth Smoothing over ATM - ATM networks
              are a popular networking technology because it provides some minimum rate
              guarantees as well as different classes of service. In this study, we will
              investigate the interactions between bandwidth smoothing techniques and three
              of ATM's classes: constant-bit-rate (CBR), variable-bit-rate (VBR), and the
              available-bit-rate (ABR) services. In the first part, we will investigate the
              efficient mapping of bandwidth smoothing algorithms into the CBR and VBR
              services. In the second part of this subtask, we will investigate the mapping
              of bandwidth smoothing techniques into the ABR service class. In particular,
              the ABR service class provides a minimum cell rate guarantee and, in times of
              relatively low network load, an available cell rate which allows the
              applications to send more than their minimum cell rate that has been
              guaranteed. We will investigate techniques for shaping video streams into the
              ABR minimum cell rate while taking advantage of the available cell rate to
              enhance the video stream when possible.  2.  Bandwidth Allocation Techniques
              for Best-Effort Networks - Many of the current approaches for delivering video
              across best-effort networks such as the Internet do so by monitoring network
              feedback and altering the video frame rate or video frame quality to fit within
              the available resources. For stored video streams, these algorithms typically
              do not take advantage of the a priori information available from stored video,
              resulting in video frame rates delivered to the user that are more variable
              than necessary. In this study, we will investigate techniques for the efficient
              streaming of stored video across best-effort networks that take advantage of
              the a priori information to smooth the video frame rate delivered to the
              user.  The solutions in this project will be evaluated using two methods.
              First, the solutions will be evaluated and refined through simulation studies
              using captured and compressed video data. In the later stages of this project,
              we will implement a simple streamed video delivery system that will demonstrate
              the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.  We will evaluate the proposed
              solutions using (1) the Internet, (2) the Ohio Computing and Communication ATM
              Research Network (OCARNet) which connects six institutions within the state of
              Ohio, and (3) vBNS - the very high speed backbone network that we have access
              to through the Ohio Supercomputing Center.  The contribution of this project
              will be to answer the following question: What is the best way to take
              advantage of a priori information in the delivery of stored video streams
              across networks, which may provide varying guarantees of network
              bandwidth?  Through the intelligent management of network resources, a
              client-side buffer, and the a priori information avail-able from stored video
              streams, the solutions developed in this project will allow us to deliver the
              highest video quality to the user. We expect that this work can serve as a
              catalyst for the development of future stored-video applications such as
              digital libraries, distance learning, and video-on-demand.
