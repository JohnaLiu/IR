Abstract    :
              9501958  Barros  New mathematical models will be developed for flood 
              forecasting and control which will accommodate the non-  stationarity in the
              hydrologic data and will integrate the  interactions between geomorphic,
              hydraulic and hydrologic  processes of flood-producing events.  The objectives
              of the  project are:  to improve the estimation of Probable Maximum 
              Precipitation (PMP) by resolving the orographic component of  extreme storms;
              to create a novel method for estimating  standard design storms; to establish
              generalized extreme  flood forecast and drought forecast indices; to couple a 
              physically-based precipitation model to a framework of  surface and subsurface
              hydrology models currently in  development by the United States Corps of
              Engineers; and to  examine basic landscape dynamics by investigating the cause 
              effect-feedback relationships between geomorphology and  hydrology, between
              river morphology and hydraulics, and  between land-use changes, geomorphology
              and hydrology.  The  educationally component of the project consists of a
              course  renovation plan for teaching Engineering Hydrology aiming at  the
              progressive inclusion in the classroom of the new  concepts developed in the
              research phase and of emerging  advanced computer technologies.  ***
