Abstract    :
              The main objective of the proposed work is to develop a quantitative theory of
              plasma turbulence in the lower ionosphere that will incorporate dynamical and
              self-organizational features.  Different regimes of nonlinear saturation of the
              instabilities are expected resulting in different quantitative characteristics
              of the developed turbulence.  A new dynamical-statistical approach for
              description of nonlinear saturation of the instabilities will be applied. 
              Based on a consistent kinetic theory developed earlier, a quantitative theory
              of electron heating by the low-frequency turbulence in strongly perturbed
              auroral regions will be developed.  Both analytical and numerical methods will
              be employed in these studies.  It is expected that the proposed theory will
              explain turbulence features observed by radar backscattering and rocket mounted
              instruments, as well as some features found in recent numerical simulations. 
              Based on theoretical results, suggestions for future experiments will be
              proposed. The general results of these studies and the unconventional
              analytical approach to the description of turbulence may be employed in other
              fields of knowledge.
