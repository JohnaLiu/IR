Abstract    :
              Moore is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue
              his studies of the dynamics of chemical bond breaking in the ground electronic
              states of molecules, with the goal to develop quantitatively predictive models
              for both thermal and state-selected unimolecular reactions.  A combination of
              spectroscopic and dynamical measurements will be performed on formyl fluoride,
              where intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution and the dissociation
              process to HF + CO proceed at comparable rates, and observed rate constants
              depend strongly on rotational and vibrational quantum number.  Initial and
              final states may be fully resolved experimentally.   The measurements will be
              compared in detail with quantitative, state-of-the-art dynamical models. These
              results will then help set the limits of validity for transition state
              theories, and reveal the possibilities for state-selective chemistry. 

Full
              detailed understanding of chemical reactions for benchmark molecular systems is
              needed to lay the groundwork for developing quantitatively predictive models
              for complex practical systems.  Outcomes from this research will yield insights
              useful for modeling the chemistry involved in combustion and atmospheric
              processes.
