The goal of this research is to implement an innovative
              imaged laser speckle strain gauge for biomedical research and diagnosis.  This
              research develops and applies such a strain gauge to increasingly difficult
              biomedical issues including the non-contacting evaluation of cortical bone and
              synthetic biomaterials, the evaluation of local microstrain variations due to
              stress concentrations, and the micromechanical analysis of soft biological
              tissues.  The specific hypotheses of the research are:  (1) improved laser
              speckle strain measurement technology can provide detailed information on the
              mechanical behavior of biological tissues and synthetic biomaterials with a
              greater strain resolution than conventional measurement techniques, including
              classical laser speckle interferometric methodologies, (2) variation in local
              mechanical properties can manifest itself so contrast variations for imaging
              purposes.  Using an improved imaged laser speckle algorithm for data collection
              and analysis, the variations in the local strain fields around structural
              inhomogeneities can be quantitatively analyzed, and (3) direct strain
              measurement in soft tissue (e.g., skin, tendons, arteries) is possible using
              the proposed imaged laser speckle strain gauge.
