A long-standing structural problem focuses on the modes of
              accommodation of the stresses that arise due to oblique motion between crustal
              blocks.  The project will test several hypotheses regarding the nature of
              continental transtension and a transition from extension to transtension, using
              the northern Owens Valley, White-Inyo Mountain and Fish Lake Valley, parts of
              the Eastern California Shear Zone.  This study promises to bring detailed
              U-Th/He, fission-track and ArAr chronologic perspective to bear on the nature
              of continental transtension.  Results are important for reconstruction of the
              stress field history of southern California from Miocene times to recent, and
              should be helpful in understanding transtensional behavior elsewhere.
