Abstract    :
              In this research project,energy extraction methods for active  noise control are
              developed. A major goal is to explore and  design robust feedback control
              methods for rendering sound fields  silent through energy extraction, and not
              via wave-cancellation.  The technique developed are applicable to local as well
              as global  silencing of sound fields. Further, these energy extraction  methods
              are effective for progressive sound fields (for example,  duct-borne noise) as
              well as reverberant noise configurations.  Any selected resonant modes as well
              as broad-band noise are  suppressed. In the context of duct-borne sound, sound
              energy is  trapped (for extraction) in the region between the source and the 
              control. The sound fields, downstream of the control are  essentially silenced.
              Initial experimental work focuses on 1-D  control of duct-borne noise with
              subsequent extension to the  acoustic caging of 3-D sound sources. Using the
              proposed robust  energy extraction methodology for noise silencing, in
              principle  all noise configurations could be silenced: 1-D, 3-D, progressive 
              wave fields or reverberant acoustic chambers. In all cases the  noise could be
              confined to a small region near the source,  rendering all space outside the
              confinement zone silent. Since  the units do not exactly provide phase and
              amplitude matching for  silencing, they will be simple, robust, and economical
              and have  universal applicability.
