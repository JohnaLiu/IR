The national interest in civil infrastructure construction and
              rehabilitation has created a need for the study of composite structures
              consisting of earth materials, polymers, and metals. Major applications for
              composite structures include liner and cap systems, foundation systems,
              underground utility installations, and communications.  Design methodologies
              for these applications require knowledge of the steady-state friction between
              soil and structure.  At present no good microscopic model exists for this
              interaction.

In this study the steady-state friction forces between the soil
              and the surface material of typical civil infrastructure components will be
              modeled as an abrasion process.  An existing tribology model for predicting
              friction and wear in abrasion will be extended to include geomaterials.  The
              model will be validated with experimental results.  First the geometric and
              spatial properties of soil grains over a range of shapes will be quantified. 
              Then the forces exerted by these particles on unlubricated and lubricated
              surfaces under conditions of variable normal stress and variable material
              hardness will be measured and the results compared with the predictions of the
              model.
