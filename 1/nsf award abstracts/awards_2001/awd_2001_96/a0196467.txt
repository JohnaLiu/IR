The Atlanta Consortium for Research in the Earth
              Science (ACRES) will conduct a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
              program at Georgia State University.  The purpose of the REU program is to
              extend opportunities to participate in geoscience research in the Atlanta area.
               REU program participants will work with ACRES faculty on selected research
              problems.  The regional geology of Georgia is both interesting and diverse. 
              Research projects will connect to the landscape in which the participants live.
               While participants are learning to conduct research they will also be learning
              about the nature of the process of scientific investigation through readings,
              discussions and personal reflections.  The participant to faculty ratio will be
              approximately 1.4:1 ensuring extensive personal attention.  ACRES faculty come
              from a diversity of academic institutions: Georgia State University; Clark
              Atlanta University and Fort Valley State University both historically black
              colleges; Georgia Perimeter College a two year undergraduate institution; and
              Columbus State University, a four year comprehensive institution.
