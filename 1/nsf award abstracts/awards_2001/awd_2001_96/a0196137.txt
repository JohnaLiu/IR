Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the renewal of a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates Site in Political Science at the University of Virginia.  The
              program, called the Ralph Bunche Summer Institute, was initiated by the
              American Political Science Association in 1986.  NSF joined in funding the
              program in 1997.  The program is designed to expand opportunities for students
              of color by preparing them to enroll in doctoral programs and become political
              science college and university professor.  Twenty black, Latino, and American
              Indian undergraduates will be immersed in a five-week intensive program that
              includes graduate level course work, and the design, analysis, write-up, and
              presentation of original research papers.  The program simulates the graduate
              school experience and focuses on scientific analysis by introducing the
              students to research methods and statistics, and the research enterprise that
              is the lifeline of professional political scientists.  Two excellent ethics
              seminars will be included in the program --  one on ethics in survey research
              and the other on ethical choices in international relations.

This award
              contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students
              into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.
