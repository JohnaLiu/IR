Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses the problem of providing high-performance access to
              interoperable data files.  Scientific databases have been touted as being the
              solution to the I/O problems faced by scientific applications.  Based on
              relational, object-oriented, or hybird data models, these systems help to
              improve the access times to the data.  In some cases they even permit parallel
              access to the database.  However, these systems do not address the problem of
              interoperability.  We propose to synthesize our previously-independent research
              in both of these areas to create data files that support both high-performance
              parallel access and interoperability.  More importantly, we propose to develop
              access methods as a part of the system interface that incorporate the notion of
              collective I/O for high-performance, functions that can learn from access
              patterns to further improve on performance for future access patterns, and a
              data description language that allows users to define abstract file types and
              specify layouts and other hints that will improve access while maintaining
              interoperability.
