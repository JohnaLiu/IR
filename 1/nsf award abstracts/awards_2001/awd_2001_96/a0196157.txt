This research deals with the
              general areas of hyperbolic conservation laws and viscous conservation laws. 
              The first set of questions concerns the well-posedness of solutions
              to
hyperbolic systems of conservation laws with large initial data, the
              uniqueness and regularity of solutions, and the study of some hyperbolic
              systems of conservation laws in several space dimensions.  The second set of
              questions lies in the area of viscous conservation laws and deals with the
              study of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with applications in fluid
              dynamics and combustion theory.  The main objective of this research project is
              to initiate a systematic investigation of the qualitative behavior of solutions
              to general multidimensional Navier-Stokes equations with large initial
              data.

This is interdisciplinary research, lying on the interface between
              continuum physics and the  theory of hyperbolic (and viscous) conservation
              laws.  The investigator studies partial differential equations arising in
              continuum physics with the expectation that the underlying physical structure
              will direct the analysis, while in return the mathematical analysis of some
              nonlinear partial differential equations will further the understanding of
              continuum physics.
