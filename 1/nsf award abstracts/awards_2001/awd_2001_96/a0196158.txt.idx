Abstract    :
              Concrete normally provides reinforcing steel with adequate corrosion protection.
               When steel is encased in concrete, a protective iron oxide film forms at the
              steel-concrete interface due to the high pH of the concrete. This film protects
              the steel from corrosion.  However, the intrusion of chloride ions in
              reinforced concrete can cause this protective film to be destroyed. 
              Additionally when moisture and oxygen are present in the concrete, the steel
              will corrode through an electrochemical process.  Once the steel begins to
              corrode, the concrete will deteriorate.  This occurs because the by products of
              corrosion occupy a greater volume than the steel itself, which exerts a
              substantial stress on the surrounding concrete.  Chloride can be introduced
              into concrete in many ways.  It may be introduced by the individual concrete
              ingredients; aggregates, cement, admixtures and mixing water; or through
              exposure to deicing salts, seawater, or salt air environments.  Since chloride
              can be introduced through many mechanisms, placing limits on any one ingredient
              (e.g. mixing water) will not always limit the total amount of chloride in the
              concrete.  Therefore, it is important to be able to measure the chloride
              content of concrete to yield an indication of the potential of corrosion of any
              embedded steel.  Currently, there are two standard tests used to measure the
              chloride penetration into concrete; namely, the "rapid chloride permeability
              test" and the "90-day ponding test".  The former test does not necessarily
              replicate the transport of chloride ions in real-life situations, nor does it
              have a sound scientific basis.  The results of this test have also been shown
              to be influenced by chemical admixtures and additives since they may contain
              some chloride.  This test is not conducted in-situ and is destructive.  Using
              the latter test takes a long time to obtain results.  The test subjects a
              concrete, specimen to a chloride sloution over a given amount of time.  Results
              from this test take at least 90 days to produce, but with the advent of newer
              high strength mixes, results may take longer due to the slow ingress of
              chloride from this test.  A new test method that can predict the chloride ion
              penetration in concrete for use with in-place concrete, would be invaluable to
              the concrete and construction industry.  This is especially true for the
              Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Department of Transportation
              where there have been major problems with chloride ingress and steel corrosion
              in pavements treated with deicing salts.  A near-field microwave nondestructive
              testing technique, employing open-ended rectangular waveguide probes, is
              proposed to predict chloride content and the extent of chloride penetration in
              concrete based materials.  The investigating team proposesto use accelerated
              techniques to introduce chloride in cement paste, mortar and concrete.  The
              objectives of this investigation are to detect the presence and the content of
              chloride in cement based materials in addition to closely estimating the extent
              or depth to which chloride has penetrated in these materials.  The
              investigating team has been successfully using such a microwave nondestructive
              testing technique to study and correlate the near-field microwave reflection
              properties of cement based materials (hardened paste, mortar and concrete) to
              their w/c ratio, s/c ratio, coarse aggregate volume and size distributions, ans
              their compressive strenths.  On a preliminary basis they have been able to
              detect chloride content, present in the mixing water, in cement paste and
              mortar as well as the influence of chloride on the curin of these specimens. 
              It is intended to subject cement paste, mortar and concrete to accelerated
              chloride penetration using an enclosed tank filled with chloride solution under
              pressure and controlled temperature.  Upon successive exposure to chloride
              solution, the reflection properties of these specimens will be measured at
              several microwave frequencies.  The results will then be correlated to the
              chloride content as well as the depth to which it has penetrated.  Using a
              discrete model describing the manner by which chloride has penetrated in these
              specimens, and existing electromagnetic model will be used to model the results
              and more importantly predict the amount of chloride and its penetrated depth
              into these materials.
