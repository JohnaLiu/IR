Abstract    :
              While current circuit testing techniques are limited by the increasing circuit
              size, the proposed research explores a new concept of spectrum-based test
              generation to tackle testing of increasingly large and complex circuits.  A
              state-of-the-art spectrum-based technique for chip functional testing is being
              explored that achieves extremely high fault coverages in short execution times.
              In this approach, the circuit is viewed as a system identifiable by its
              input-output characteristics instead of a traditional netlist of primitives. 
              Spectral characteristics are extracted and analyzed for the input/output
              signals of the system under test, and the resulting data are used to predict
              and construct intelligent test patterns. In addition, this functional spectral
              knowledge also provides new means for built-in-self-test (BIST), applicable
              also for system-on-a-chip.  This research addresses the relevant issues in the
              spectrum-based testing framework: (a) the development of various techniques for
              spectral extraction for a given circuit; (b) the analysis of different spectral
              bases (orthogonal and non-orthogonal) and how they can influence spectral
              characteristics for testing; and (c) the application of transform domain to
              identify dominant frequency components to generate intelligent patterns.
