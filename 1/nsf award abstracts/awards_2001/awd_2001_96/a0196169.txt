This Americas Program award will fund a two year
              cooperative research project between Dr. Jan Chomicki, Monmouth College, NJ,
              and Dr. Leopoldo Bertossi, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, on a
              project to search for a logical characterization of consistent query answers in
              relational databases that may be inconsistent with the given integrity
              constraints.  Integrity constraints capture an important normative aspect of
              every database application, but often their satisfaction cannot be guaranteed
              and there may exist database instances that violate them.  It is important to
              know which query answers are consistent with the integrity constraints, and
              which are not. To answer this question the research will address a number of
              issues, including semantics of consistent query answers, procedures to compute
              consistent query answers and their implementation, formal analysis of the
              properties of such procedures, soundness, completeness, termination,
              computations, complexity, identification of classes of constraints with
              superior computational properties, and applications to data cleaning in data
              warehouses, information integration in heterogeneous databases, and triggers  
              Results of this study could be applied to a number of areas, including data
              warehousing (CD97), database integration and active and reactive databases. 
              

This cooperative project brings together Dr. Chomicki's expertise in
              database theory with Dr. Bertossi's  extensive background in mathematical logic
              and knowledge presentation.  This combination will greatly enhance the
              opportunity for a successful solution to the issues addressed by this study .
