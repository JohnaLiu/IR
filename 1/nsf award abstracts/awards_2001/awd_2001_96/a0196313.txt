Abstract    :
              	Dr. Zehnder will continue to investigate the hypothesis that most cases of
              Eastern Pacific tropical cyclogenesis results from the interaction between
              easterly waves and the orography of Mexico and Central America.  Under a
              previous award, he completed a case study of Hurricane Guillermo which suggests
              that orography played a strong role in the formation of the storm.  The next
              phase of this research will involve analysis of ECMWF gridded data
              (composites), GOES data, and simulations with the MM5 model to further document
              the existence of orographically forced circulations and their role in tropical
              cyclogenesis.  Using satellite data to identify areas of deep convection, Dr.
              Zehnder will construct composites of various fields for the prior 24-48 hour
              period from the ECMWF data sets.  He will look for evidence of easterly waves
              and compare those cases where deep convective clusters developed into tropical
              cyclones and those when they did not.  For the modeling component, he will
              carry out a number of idealized flow experiments to look at the roles of
              orography, easterly waves, and the North American monsoon trough.
