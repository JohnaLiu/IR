Arone
     Arone is interested in applying the theory of calculus
              of functors
(developed by T. Goodwillie and M. Weiss) to study the
              unstable
homotopy of such spaces as spheres and classifying spaces of
              compact
Lie groups.  Calculus of functors allows one to introduce
              certain
``derivatives'' of homotopy groups.  If one understands
              these
derivatives well, one can use them to recover a lot of
              information
about unstable homotopy theory (this is analogous to the fact that
              if
one knows all the derivatives of an ordinary function at a point, one
can
              often recover a lot of information about the function by means of
Taylor
              series).  The derivatives are really objects of stable homotopy
theory, and
              they normally come equipped with interesting symmetries of
certain classical
              groups, such as the symmetric or orthogonal groups
(division by the action of
              the symmetric group corresponds to division
by n! in ordinary Taylor series). 
              Thus calculus allows one to reduce
questions about unstable homotopy theory to
              questions about
equivariant stable homotopy theory.  This does not yield an
              effective
method for calculating homotopy groups (there probably is no
              such
method), but it does allow one to make interesting
              qualitative
statements about the global structure of homotopy theory. 
              Analyzing
the derivatives of different objects, together with the
              accompanying
symmetries, has been the focus of much of Arone's work. 
              These
derivatives seem to be very interesting objects on their own,
              and
studying them involves combining methods from stable homotopy
              theory,
equivariant topology, and group cohomology in fresh and
              unexpected
ways.
     Many basic questions in mathematics, and in topology,
              in particular,
are of the following form: given two objects, describe the
              possible
functions between them.  For instance, one can ask to describe
              the
space of continuous maps between two topological spaces, or the space
of
              embeddings of a circle into some physical space (this is informally
known as
              the space of ``knots'').  These questions are usually very
difficult.  This is
              so because the dependence of the space of
functions on the source and the
              target is very complicated.
Informally, one could say that the space of
              functions is a complicated
function of two variables.  It turns out that, in
              analogy to ordinary
differential calculus, one can develop a theory of
              ``Taylor series''
of sorts for this kind of function and use it to
              approximate
complicated spaces such as function spaces by simpler spaces,
              in
much the same way as an ordinary function can be approximated by
              its
Taylor polynomials.  This very striking idea was conceived by
T.
              Goodwillie.  Much of Arone's work has focused on understanding the
``Taylor
              polynomials'' and the ``Derivatives'' in this context.  This
has proved to be
              a fascinating and rewarding journey, which has
already led to interesting new
              results in (algebraic) topology.  Some
of the results are of such a universal
              nature that there is at least a
slight hope that this work will have an impact
              on mathematics outside
hardcore algebraic topology.
