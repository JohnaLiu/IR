Abstract    :
              
	This collaborative project (with 0108228) studies a core issue in medical
              anthropology, the relationship between cultural beliefs and health status.  The
              project investigates patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus to understand what
              strategies people use to successfully manage the disease, and whether these
              strategies differ by ethnic group.  Three groups will be studied, Mexican,
              African- and European-American diabetic patients in Galveston, Texas, as well
              as Mexican patients in Guadalajara, Mexico (studied with Mexican colleagues). 
              The project will also analyze whether patients whose cultural models of
              diabetes agree more closely with the understanding of providers enjoy better
              health status than patients whose understanding is more variant. The project
              will also study whether the co-occurrence of the folk illness "susto" with
              diabetes is associated with a generally poorer health status. Methods include
              ethnographic interviewing, consensus analysis, the measure of hemoglobinA1c to
              assess health status, standard self-report scales available in Spanish which
              focus on depression and stress and formal interviews about social support. The
              results from this research will advance our understanding of the role of
              cultural and individual belief systems in a person's health status; will
              advance the use of consensus analysis in ethnographic research; and will
              contribute valuable new knowledge to health professionals dealing with diabetes
              to help advise patients on treatment regimes.
