Abstract    :
              DEB-0108424 Bruns
Epiparasitic plants are not photosynthetic, and they
              indirectly obtain sugars from green plants through a mycorrhizal fungus that is
              connected to both plants.  This behavior makes them cheaters of one of the most
              widespread mutualisms in terrestrial ecosystems.  Our goals are to understand
              the costs and benefits of epiparasitic plants to their direct fungal and
              indirect plant hosts, and to examine life history traits related to the
              establishment of epiparasite seedlings.  We address these goals through four
              specific hypotheses related to conditional changes in the symbiotic continuum,
              to effects on host-fungal competitive interactions, and to ecological
              mechanisms for host specificity.  These hypotheses are tested by coupling
              symbiotic germination experiments in the field with manipulative growth chamber
              experiments.  We use precise molecular identification of fungi and plants in
              both settings.  Results will provide an in-depth understanding of the nature of
              the interactions at the plant-parasitic end the mycorrhizal symbiosis, will
              yield novel data on specificity, germination, and development of these plants,
              and will further develop a unique experimental system of symbiotic cheating. 
              This information will increase of our knowledge of mycorrhizal symbiosis, and
              will help us to manage populations of some of the rare and endangered species
              in the Monotropoideae.
