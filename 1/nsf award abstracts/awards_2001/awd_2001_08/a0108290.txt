Abstract    :
              How we can use the power of technology to promote meaningful learning in math
              and science?  PFSMETE research project consists of testing the hypothesis that
              rich experiential environments and reflective interactions are both necessary
              conditions for effective educational technology.  To promote experiential
              cognition, students should be exposed to realistic and varied experiences in
              order to ensure the ability to use what they have learned to understand new and
              ecologically valid situations.  To promote active learning through reflection,
              students should be asked to reflect as new concepts are being introduced in the
              lesson with the help, for example, of a pedagogical agent or by
              self-evaluation.

The proposed studies set out to test the main hypothesis in
              two different domains (science and math), for two different student populations
              (elementary and college students), and with the primary dependent measure being
              the number of acceptable solutions that students generate for divergent
              problem-solving questions.
