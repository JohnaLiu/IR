This proposal seeks funding for a joint project between
              Duke University and Genetronics, Inc. that will focus on theoretical studies of
              electroporation-mediated DNA delivery.  Electroporation is a broad-based
              technique in which strong electrical shocks are used to create pores in the
              cell membrane that enable biologically active molecules to enter the cell
              interior.  Even though it is used quite extensively in biotechnology and
              medicine, electroporation is essentially empirical and its theoretical
              understanding lags behind practical applications.  Genetronics, which
              specializes in developing technology and hardware that uses electroporation to
              deliver life-saving drugs or beneficial genes to patients, recognizes the
              importance of understanding the mechanism by which an electric field promotes
              the uptake of DNA by cells and explaining differences observed experimentally
              in the effects of electric fields on the uptake of small vs. large molecules. 
              These issues were investigated by the PI during her six month sabbatical at
              Genetronics, which was funded by the NSF GOALI Faculty in Industry award
              (BES-9974185, 8-1-1999 to 1-31-2000).  This preliminary research revealed that
              the existing models, developed for ions and small molecules, do not describe
              the uptake of large and highly charged molecules such as DNA.  Therefore, there
              is a need to develop a theory that would be applicable specifically to DNA and
              similar macromolecules.
