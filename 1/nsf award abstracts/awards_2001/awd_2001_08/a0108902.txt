Abstract    :
              David McMillan of Purdue University  is supported by the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program to conduct research on
              photochemistry of complexes of  late transition elements and DNA.  The proposed
              research will use photochemical methods to gain understanding of  binding of
              late transition metal porphyrin complexes to DNA and to devise methods to
              direct that binding. The research will also  develop porphyrin and polypyridine
              complexes of late transition series elements as novel photosensitive probes for
              technologically important uses.  

Many late transition series complexes
              feature open coordination positions. The chemical flexibility engendered by
              such vacancies can be exploited to gain otherwise unattainable understanding of
              interactions between metallic species and DNA.  Photochemical processes
              involving complexes of  late transition metals with DNA have considerable 
              potential for producing new agents for photodynamic therapy, as well as in
              clarifying factors influencing the binding of metallic species to DNA.
