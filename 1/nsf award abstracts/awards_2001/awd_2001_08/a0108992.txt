	The impact of native groups on tropical forests is
              not well understood. In some cases, analysts feel that traditional societies
              have a benign conservationist effect on the forest, in others, that they
              exploit and degrade the forest with no thought on future productivity. This
              project involves the dissertation research of a Forestry/Environmental Studies
              and Anthropology student from Yale University.  The student will analyze the
              effects of ethnicity, migration and land tenure on forest use in Vietnam
              through ethnographic fieldwork using participant observation, household
              surveys, mapping and analysis of extant records. The hypotheses to be tested
              are that ethnicity, migration and land tenure play a role in how different user
              groups manage the forest.  Three different ethnic groups will be studied:
              indigenous Chut, in-migrant and longer-term Vietnamese, and in-migrant Muong.
              The new knowledge created by this project will advance our understanding of how
              multi-ethnic societies can manage a scarce resource, a timely question in the
              contemporary world.  In addition the project contributes to the training of a
              young social scientist, and increases our knowledge of this important region of
              the world.
