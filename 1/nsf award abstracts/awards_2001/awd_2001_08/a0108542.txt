Most plants and mycorrhizal fungi have a mutually
              beneficial exchange of nutrients (from fungi) and carbohydrates (from plants). 
              We propose that plants can increase their growth by choosing the most
              beneficial species of mycorrhizal fungus in each environment and therefore that
              their growth, competitive ability with other plants, and ultimate success is
              strongly influenced by these mutually positive interactions. This hypothesis
              assumes that 1) species of mycorrhizal fungi differ in their benefits to plant
              growth, 2) the beneficial effects of each fungal species depend on
              environmental conditions, and 3) the plants have the capability of "choosing" a
              particular fungal species.  These assumptions that different fungi will be
              predominant in different environments. We will test this hypothesis using field
              and laboratory studies of tree seedlings and mycorrhizal fungi.  First, we will
              survey the fungi species that associate with several species of forest
              seedlings in different field environments. Second, we will test the fungal
              species found in the field to quantify how effective they are at providing
              nutrients to plants in each environment and to determine the most beneficial
              fungus for each environment.  Third, we will test whether seedlings "choose"
              the most beneficial fungus in each environment by planting seedlings with a
              mixture of all the fungi in each environment.  Finally, we will test the
              importance of these processes in nature by manipulating the field environments
              and testing whether the fungal mutualist partners of each plant change
              according to the predictions generated from the previous experiments.
