Abstract    :
              The PIs propose to use paleobotanical and paleogeochemical data with a model
              developed for understanding modern controls on vegetation distribution to
              explore the fundamental mechanisms behind complex advance, retreat, and further
              advance of a boreal-tundra ecotone along the Brooks Range in Alaska.  The
              paleobotanical evidence will be used to examine several different approaches to
              discern movements of the ecotone with a species-level resolution with the
              changes in climate variables (temperature, precipitation amount, and
              seasonality of precipitation).  The analysis will provide independent climate
              and vegetation datasets.  The climate dataset will be used to drive an
              ecosystem model to simulate changing vegetation under changing climate.  The
              results of the study will provide a useful predictive capability for separating
              climate-induced changes from those caused by feedbacks in the
              climate-vegetation system when attempting predictions of boreal forest
              ecosystem responses to future climate change.
