Abstract    :
              The Calumet Region in Chicago provides a unique opportunity to explore
              redevelopment options that marry environmental and economic development
              concerns.  Several apparently competing options have been proposed but no
              formal economic assessment has been provided.  The proposed research will
              develop a user-friendly PC-based software system to enable analysis of the
              anticipated benefits from a set of 5-10 development options.  Care will be
              taken to integrate economic and environmental concerns by combining qualitative
              and quantitative information.  The system will be field-tested with various
              environmental and economic development organizations who represent the major
              stakeholders in the region.  A unique feature of the project is the cooperation
              among a diverse group of University of Illinois scholars, the City of Chicago
              Department of the Environment and the Chicago Academy of Sciences.
