This award supports a conference, Spintronics 2001, to
              held August 9-11, 2001, at Georgetown University.  This conference will deal
              with novel aspects and possible applications of spin-polarized transport and
              spin dynamics in a wide range of materials, such as magnetic semiconductors,
              superconductors and carbon nanotubes.  The feasibility of novel hybrid devices,
              including spin transistors, spin filters and memory devices, and their future
              technological impact will be the main focus of this meeting.  Scientists with
              very diverse backgrounds will be encouraged to participate, with the goal to
              bring together expertise and ideas from different scientific communities and
              provide a broad view of the status and perspectives of spintronics
              research.

This grant supports conference costs for young participants
              (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty).
