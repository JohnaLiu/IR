White-tailed deer population sizes have increased
              dramatically over the last 50 years in the eastern half of North America.  As a
              result of this increase, the non-woody understory vegetation in forests is
              being consumed to a greater degree.  This has resulted in a significant decline
              in flowering and fruiting of the native wild flower community in the presence
              of deer.  However, when deer were excluded via fences, some plant species that
              were previously consumed by deer were observed to grow to larger sizes and
              reproduce.  Other species in the deer exclosures are not reproducing. The goal
              of this research is to determine the likelihood of persistence or decline of
              understory wild flower species in the continued presence or absence of deer. 
              Using key species naturally occurring in deer exclosure plots (fenced) and
              paired control plots (no fence) we will monitor their growth, survival ,
              flowering and fruiting. Comparative demographic analyses using data from
              exclosure and control plots will be conducted to determine the likelihood of
              persistence or extinction of these species.  This research will help inform
              wildlife and forest management decisions.
