Abstract    :
              This project seeks to sponsor engineering students to attend the 2001 American
              Control Conference sponsored by the American Automatic Control Council.  The
              conference will focus on theoretical issues, engineering methodologies and
              industrial applications in every aspect of control research and development. 
              The goal of this proposal is to develop an opportunity for engineering students
              to be informed about the most recent advances in the areas of control theory
              and practices.  Travel support for student attendance will be advertised
              nationwide and women, minorities and disabled students will be especially
              encouraged to apply for sponsorship.
