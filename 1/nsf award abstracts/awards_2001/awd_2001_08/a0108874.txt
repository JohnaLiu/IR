Abstract    :
              gThe collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris) lives on rocky outcrops in the
              Ozarks called glades.  Suppression of forest fires has destroyed many glades
              and has transformed the surrounding forest from an open woodlands into a forest
              with a dense understory.  By 1980 no populations of collared lizards existed
              within or nearby the Stegall Mountain Natural Area.  Between 1984 and 1989, we
              translocated three populations of collared lizards onto restored glades in this
              natural area.  All three flourished, but we observed no animal dispersing
              between glades and no colonization of new glades up to 1993.  In 1994 the
              Missouri Department of Conservation began prescribed burns in this area.  
              Under fire management, genetic interchanges began to occur between glades, 44
              glades were colonized, and the population size increased over10-fold.  We
              propose to (1) continue to document the lizards' range expansion and
              characterize its genetic consequences, (2) quantify the amount of extinction
              and recolonization on glades under fire management, (3) measure the amount of
              genetic interchange among glade populations, and (4) monitor the genetic health
              of the populations. 


We rarely have the opportunity to observe drastic
              alterations in a species' population structure.  Here we can. Conservation
              biology places great importance upon interchange among local populations, and
              here we can directly test whether or not landscape-level management affects
              such interchanges.  Another basic tool of conservation biology is effective
              population size, which can be used to monitor the rate of loss of genetic
              diversity and the rate of accumulation of potentially deleterious inbreeding. 
              Because we know the initial state (the original three translocated
              populations), we can estimate effective sizes with unprecedented accuracy and
              compare our estimates to those based on the commonly used approximations.  Such
              a comparison is long over due given the importance of effective size in
              conservation, and we are in a unique position to do it.
