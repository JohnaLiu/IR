Abstract    :
              Stanley 0108619 - This research offers a rare opportunity to investigate the
              effects of dam removal on the physical environment and biogeochemical
              processes, including anthropogenic disturbance impacts, ecological succession,
              sediment transport, and nutrient retention.  This is a poorly understood area
              with little reliable data, and the project will capitalize on recent and
              upcoming dam removals in Wisconsin's Baraboo River, the longest river restored
              to free-flowing conditions in the Unites States.  The project will obtain
              information critical to understanding and managing dams and dam removals.  The
              study unites basic science with management objectives by addressing conceptual
              ecological models of riverine system function, and how anthropogenic structural
              alterations evolve over time into more natural wetland habitats.  The models
              developed during this project have broad applicability for river management and
              the advancement of ecological succession theory.
