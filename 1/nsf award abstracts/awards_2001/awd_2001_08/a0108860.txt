Two-phase turbulent flow
              occurs in many industrial processes including nuclear reactors, separation and
              washing, and many chemical and heat transfer applications.  Prediction of this
              complex flow has been primarily based on extension of two-equation turbulent
              models developed for single phase turbulent flow.  Although the two-equation
              models are effective for many industrial applications, their validity and
              accuracy requires more direct simulation and analysis.  

This proposal is on
              direct numerical simulation (DNS) of two phase turbulent flow using a
              combination of finite element method (FEM) and a level set (LS) approach.  The
              flexibility of the FEM to map irregularly shaped interfaces will be used along
              with the volume-of-fluid (VOF) type approach to track the interface by solving
              an additional transport equations for the location and shape of the interface. 
              To effectively capture and resolve the interface, particularly during bubble
              breakup and coalescence, extremely fine and adaptive grid structure is
              required.  To this end, the proposal makes extensive use of the well
              established adaptive grid refinement algorithms developed at RPI over the
              years. The success of the proposed approach depends on the accuracy and
              efficient implementation of the method on massive parallel processing systems.
