Predicting population regulation is a fundamental goal of
              ecological and evolutionary studies. Population regulation must arise from
              effects of interactions between individuals on rate of reproduction and progeny
              survival. Interactions should be intense at high density, but weak at low
              density. The recent discovery of a genetic basis for population regulation of
              side-blotched lizards facilitates study of density effects. Lizards carry a
              genetic color marker for alternative reproductive strategies that have
              cascading effects on progeny survival. Population density and frequency of two
              genotypes will be manipulated in large-scale field experiments. Genetic change
              and population regulation will be studied across two generations on replicate
              field plots. Furthermore, laboratory breeding studies will determine whether
              the color marker and associated reproductive attributes are due to a single
              gene, or from many genes. 

Mechanisms of hormonal regulation are conserved
              among lizards, mammals, and birds. Thus, studies on lizards provide basic
              information on genes and hormones that control reproduction in many
              free-ranging and domestic species. Furthermore, experiments on density
              regulation in the wild provide basic information that is vital for predicting
              long-term changes in animal numbers. For example, predicting long-term effects
              of global climate change will require an understanding of the ecological and
              genetic causes of population regulation.
