Defining Hydro-Ecological Research
              Priorities

This workshop will bring together 20 riverine scientists in July
              2001 to focus on linkages between river flow regimes and biota.  The workshop
              has a science focus, and will precede a large conference entitled Managing
              River Flows for Biodiversity. Objectives of the workshop are to: 1) identify
              key knowledge gaps and 2) develop a prioritized research agenda.  The
              organizers, Dr. Richter of the Nature Conservancy and Dr. LeRoy Poff of
              Colorado State University, plan to host an electronic forum among participants
              in advance of the workshop. The product of the workshop will be a white paper
              posted at the conference web site identifying critical uncertainties and
              knowledge gaps and research priorities. The workshop report will also be
              published as part of the conference proceedings.
