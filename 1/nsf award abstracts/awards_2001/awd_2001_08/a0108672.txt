Abstract    :
              The research is for the development of mathematical and numerical models for the
              full numerical simulation of jetting phenomena.  The principal investigators
              develop new mathematical and numerical models for phase change, vapor bubble
              formation, vapor bubble collapse, and "explosive evaporation."  New numerical
              methods for including compressibility in low speed flow are being developed. 
              The resulting models are cast in an adaptive mesh framework in order to gain in
              CPU runtime and memory efficiency.

This research program, the numerical
              simulation of jetting devices, unravels basic physical mechanisms underlying
              the jetting processes.  This leads to improvement in design of microscale
              jetting devices.  The simulation substantially reduces the design cycle period
              of such devices as ink-jet printers, soldering, and the application of DNA
              strands.
