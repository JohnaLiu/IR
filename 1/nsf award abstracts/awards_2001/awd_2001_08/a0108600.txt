Abstract    :
              A three-year program of comprehensive studies of ionospheric E- and F-region
              electrodynamics and of related aeronomic issues surrounding meteor-derived
              metals in the upper atmosphere is proposed.  The proposed studies are based on
              an extensive ongoing observing program at Arecibo Observatory (AO) that
              involves incoherent scatter radar (ISR) and meteor-mode radar as well as
              proposed associated metal (Ca/Ca+, Fe, K, Na) lidar observations.  AO is
              uniquely suited for these proposed studies with the new dual-beam capability
              yielding the first true 3-D observations, extreme sensitivity and directivity
              in both ISR and meteor-modes, and the common-volume lidar capabilities.  The
              proposed observational and theoretical studies are intended to comprehensively
              test and extend the hypotheses and conclusions concerning the origin and scale
              of the apparently "new" electrodynamic processes resulting plasma-sheets and
              related phenomena including true sporadic-E and in firmly tying micrometeoroid
              atmospheric-entry processes to the aeronomy of metals in the upper atmosphere
              and to provide whole-earth micrometeoroid mass fluxes of unprecedented
              accuracy.
