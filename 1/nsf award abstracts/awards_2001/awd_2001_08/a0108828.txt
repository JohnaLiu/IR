Abstract    :
              
	This dissertation research project in cultural anthropology will examine the
              emergence of new forms of property rights in the recent adoption of groundwater
              irrigation by farmers in the Cochabamba valley of highland Bolivia.
              Historically farmers had used water from descending rivers and streams stored
              in reservoirs to irrigate their fields, but in recent times they developed the
              capacity to use well water. Comparable systems that have been studied at first
              have appeared unstructured and chaotic, but upon analysis have appeared to be
              products of innovation, adaptation, learning and entrepreneurial skill.  The
              student will analyze the cultural models of property rights held by farmers as
              well as the transaction costs of alternative forms of property rights, study
              the history of institutions governing groundwater usage and use GIS and spatial
              analysis to identify locations and spatial systems, to analyze how local Andean
              property rights have adapted to a new economic strategy. The student's project
              will make a significant contribution by widening the "New Institutional
              Economics" approach to include cultural models, symbols and meaning, and will
              advance our understanding of high altitude irrigation systems, as well as our
              knowledge of this important region of the world.  In addition the project
              contributes to the training of a young social scientist.
