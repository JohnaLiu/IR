This project utilizes one of the largest datasets ever
              assembled for free-living birds, a dataset based on a long-term study of  three
              migratory duck species in which young ducklings and their mothers are
              individually marked and then located later in life. Advanced statistical
              procedures will be used to assess lifetime reproductive success (LRS), the best
              available estimate of biological fitness in wild animals. LRS combines two key
              measures, the number of full-grown young produced from each breeding attempt
              and adult survivalrates, into a single measure of individual lifetime
              reproductive performance. This study is an exciting extension of a
              previously-funded NSF project. 

Results will elucidate variation in LRS and
              trade-offs between survival and reproductive effort. A critical part of the
              project is the combined application of modern survival analysis techniques with
              other advanced statistical procedures, providing simultaneous evaluation of the
              relative importance of numerous possible predictors of LRS. These findings are
              likely to have practical management implications for adjusting the timing,
              length, and bag limits for hunting seasons of harvested migratory waterfowl. 
              Furthermore, gauging the relative impact on LRS of an individual's
              characteristics versus external environmental variation will greatly assist the
              design of successful bird conservation programs.
