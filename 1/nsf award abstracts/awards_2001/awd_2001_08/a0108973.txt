Title: Special Projects: 
              Biological Information Processing and Systems Workshop  

This is a workshop
              proposal in biological computation and data with an emphasis on new methods in
              single cell and multi-cell information processing, including hardware and
              systems aspects.  The workshop is interdisciplinary, involving engineers,
              neuroscientists, cell biologists, computer scientists, chemists, and material
              scientists.
