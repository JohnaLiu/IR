Abstract    :
              Nutritional symbioses between plants and soil microbes are critically important
              to plant evolution and ecosystem function, yet we know almost nothing about the
              evolutionary dynamics and mechanisms of persistence of these ancient
              interactions.  Mutualistic interactions are widespread and obligatory for many
              organisms, yet their evolutionary persistence in the face of cheating is
              theoretically puzzling.  Partner-choice and partner-fidelity are mechanisms for
              dealing with cheaters, and can theoretically allow mutualisms to persist. 
              Evidence for sanctions against cheaters, a form of partner-choice, has recently
              been uncovered in several plant-pollinator interactions.  Market models assume
              partner choice, and hence offer useful paradigms for understanding the
              evolutionary dynamics of mutualisms in which individuals attempt to conduct
              mutually beneficial trade of resources with multiple individuals (the market). 
              The proposed studies will test whether partner-choice can explain the
              evolutionary persistence of this mutualism in wild legumes of the genus
              Lupinus, and Bradyrhizobium, the nitrogen-fixing bacteria that inhabit their
              root nodules.  Achieving these goals is the first step in an integrated
              analysis of genetic variation, symbiotic quality, and plant adaptive responses
              in the legume-rhizobium interaction.  Our results will begin to construct a
              framework for understanding the persistence and evolutionary dynamics of this
              important mutualism.
