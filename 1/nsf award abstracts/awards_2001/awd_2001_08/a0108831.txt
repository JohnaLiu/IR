Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is designed to
              build a prototype miniature fiber optic NOx sensor for the control of auto
              emissions.  The proposed sensor is based upon a company invention on miniature
              chemilluminescence detector for gas chromatography. The prototype will be
              miniature in size (4 cubic inch approximately), weight (1/2 lb) and capable of
              ppt level detection as a result of the innovative design.

Commercial
              applications will focus on pollution monitoring, insitu auto NOx emission
              monitoring and reduction, and biochemical/drug analysis when coupled with a
              miniature catalytic converter.
