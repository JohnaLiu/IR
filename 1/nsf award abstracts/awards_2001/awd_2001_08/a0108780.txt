Abstract    :
              The goal of this study is to determine how characteristics of the landscape and
              species life history traits (i.e., annuals vs. perennials and rare vs. common
              species) interact to determine the large-scale (i.e., 10 km to 100 km)
              distribution and dynamics of plant populations.  Factors such as habitat patch
              size and the distance from the nearest neighboring population are thought to
              control the probabilities of population extinction and the subsequent
              re-colonization of a vacant location.  Very few field studies have been
              performed to test these predictions.  This investigation will focus on coastal
              wetland plants in Narragansett Bay, RI, USA.  GPS technologies will be used to
              map out the location of wetland habitats and yearly surveys of 350 habitat
              patches within a 20 x 30 km study area will document population extinction and
              patch re-colonization by 12 plant species. 

Understanding how landscape
              characteristics affect the large-scale dynamics of populations is fundamental
              to biological conservation.  For example, such information can be used to
              optimally design marine reserves, ensuring that networks of protected areas are
              large enough and close enough to each other to maintain stable populations of
              rare and endangered species.  This study will also enable resource managers to
              detect and mitigate the effects of environmental impacts to this and other
              wetland habitats.
