Abstract    :
              What are the effects of money in state supreme court elections? Do these effects
              vary across selection systems and type of elections (incumbent-challenger
              versus open seat, primaries versus general)? Despite the fact that no area of
              political science has received greater attention than the study of elections,
              judicial elections, the means by which the most judges in the United States
              attain their positions, have been virtually ignored. This doctoral dissertation
              systematically analyzes and answers two central questions: 1) who contributes
              to state supreme court candidates, how much do they give, and to whom do they
              give? and 2) how do campaign contributions and expenditures affect the outcomes
              of state supreme court elections? The researcher examines these questions using
              all contested elections for state supreme courts between 1990-1995 in all
              states that require candidates for judicial office to file campaign finance
              reports. The researcher combines data to be collected for this project on
              campaign contributions and expenditures with a database on state supreme court
              elections collected by Melinda Gann Hall (SES- 9911166) and Paul Brace (SES-
              9911082). This dissertation will not only answer the question of whether money
              affects state supreme court elections, but also how and under what
              circumstances. Further, by comparing the influence of money in state supreme
              court elections to elections for other offices as well as comparing partisan
              elections to nonpartisan elections and retention elections, this dissertation
              will enable us to gain a more complete picture of the factors influencing the
              electoral process.
