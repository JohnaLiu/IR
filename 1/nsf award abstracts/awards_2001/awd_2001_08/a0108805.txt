Abstract    :
              Professor S. Scott Saavedra and his co-workers at the University of Arizona are
              developing biocompatible coatings that can be used as a universal platform for
              the support of protein receptors in biosensing devices.  With the support of
              the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, this group is examining the use
              of polymerizable planar lipid bilayers for this use.  Both specific and
              nonspecific protein interactions with the lipid bilayers are evaluated, using
              novel optical waveguide spectroscopic methods developed in Professor Saavedra's
              laboratory.  Methods for generating patterned microarrays of these materials
              are being developed as well. 

Protein or peptide specific sensors show great
              promise for analysis of biological systems, for monitoring drug dosages and
              uptakes, and for detecting biomaterials in a variety of applications.  The
              development of robust, versatile substrates for these sensor applications is
              the subject of this research project.  Using novel polymerizable lipid
              bilayers, a universal platform for these biosensors is being developed.
