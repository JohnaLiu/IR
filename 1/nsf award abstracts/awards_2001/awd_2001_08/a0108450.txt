Abstract    :
              Many populations, communities, and ecosystems persist in environments where some
              or all life stages disperse in media with a strong directional bias.  Examples
              include plants with windborn seeds, aquatic organisms in streams, rivers and
              estuaries, and marine organisms with larval dispersal influenced by ocean
              currents.  The overall objective of this research is to develop a modeling
              framework describing consumer-resource interactions in such systems. The
              approach is to study a suite of mathematical models of increasing complexity
              and ecological specificity.  Although many of the results will have wider
              application, the primary emphasis is on mechanisms that are important in stream
              ecology.
