Abstract    :
              DEB-0108412 - Lovell
Environmental disturbance by such factors as storms, fires
              and predators,  is a pervasive force impacting the diversity and organization
              of organism communities.  Because of competitive interactions, higher organism
              typically have their peak species diversity at intermediate disturbance levels.
               Microbial communities are much more dependent upon positive interactions than
              on competition, and are organized in mutualistic consortia.  The interactions
              among species in these consortia facilitate vital ecological functions, such as
              organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling, and are highly dependent on
              the physical structure of undisturbed sediments and on modifications of this
              structure by the organisms.  Among the most dramatic modifications by the
              resident microbiota is biofilm formation.  The biofilms stabilize consortia and
              provide homeostasis for the microorganisms within them.  We predict that unlike
              higher organisms, the mutualistic nature of sediment microbial assemblages will
              be seriously disrupted by disturbance and will take several experimental
              approaches to test this theory.  We seek to integrate the impacts of
              disturbance on sediment microbiota into the theoretical and empirical framework
              of disturbance effects on higher organism communities.  This would serve both
              fields by providing much needed theoretical underpinnings to an important
              aspect of microbial ecology.
