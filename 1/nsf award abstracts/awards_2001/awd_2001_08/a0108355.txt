Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
              techniques for low-cost, high-efficiency, wide-bandwidth power amplifiers for
              magnetic-resonance-imaging (MRI) systems.  To date, MRI transmitters have been
              based upon broadband linear power amplifiers, which are inefficient and
              consequently large, heavy, and expensive.  Further, there is a growing demand
              for systems operating at higher frequencies with larger bandwidths.  Existing
              high efficiency transmitters are relatively expensive and have limited
              bandwidths.  The approach in Phase I is based upon high-level amplitude
              modulation, low cost RF power transistors, digital signal processing, and
              electronic tuning.

The principal potential commercial application is MRI. 
              Other applications include radio frequency communications, high frequency
              radar, radio frequency heating (plasmas,  semiconductors), and laser drivers.
