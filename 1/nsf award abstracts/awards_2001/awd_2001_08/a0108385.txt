Abstract    :
              Recent work by the PI's shows that at a global scale, soil carbon:nitrogen (C:N)
              is a very strong predictor of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) losses in surface
              runoff.  If this relationship holds at the watershed and landscape scale, then
              soil C:N would provide a powerful tool for predicting and modeling changes in
              DOC flux.  In this project, the PIs will examine the nature of the relationship
              between soil properties and DOC flux in wet tropical forests of Puerto Rico,
              the northern mixed forests of New Hampshire and a heath/moorland in Scotland. 
              The proposed research examines the value of soil D:N in predicting variability
              in DOC flux within the three ecosystems, and also examines some of the
              underlying physical and biological mechanisms which may be responsible for the
              linkage between DOC flux and soil C:N recently documented at the global scale. 
               The research will include empirical and modeling components and is expected to
              result in a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating DOC losses in
              tropical and temperate sites.  The broader implications of this work relate to
              watershed management in that dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen have
              important effects on surface water quality. Trace metal solubility, formation
              of trihalomethanes in drinking water supplies, and pesticide transport are all
              linked to DOC levels.
