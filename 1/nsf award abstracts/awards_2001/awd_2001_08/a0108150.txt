Abstract    :
              DEB-0108150	Coley
Plants and herbivores comprise the majority of the earth's
              biodiversity, and nowhere are their interactions as intense as in tropical
              forests. The evolutionary interactions between herbivores and plants has led to
              an "arms race" in which innovations in plant defenses are met by counter
              adaptations on the part of herbivores. For example, plants have a battery of
              physical, chemical and phenological defenses which help to protect their leaves
              against herbivores and pathogens. And herbivores have a staggering array of
              mechanisms for avoiding, detoxifying and even using plant defenses for their
              own benefit. Despite the wide acceptance that many traits of plants and
              herbivores result from an "arms race", we know very little about the underlying
              evolutionary mechanisms or ecological conditions that would lead to the
              evolution of novel defenses. To address this, we will study the defenses of
              rainforest trees in the family Leguminosae, quantifying various defenses,
              including alkaloids,  measuring rates of leaf-feeding by herbivores and
              characterizing growth and defensive traits of herbivores. The work will be
              conducted at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama and at the
              University of Utah. This basic research is necessary for understanding how
              natural selection favors the evolution of novel defenses as well as why suites
              of defenses tend to co-occur in different species of plants, as well as how
              plant defenses may constrain the behaviors, growth and defenses of the
              herbivores that feed on them. In addition, the research has applications for
              forest management, and for the development of medicinal drugs and agricultural
              crops using genes and defensive compounds from wild plants.
