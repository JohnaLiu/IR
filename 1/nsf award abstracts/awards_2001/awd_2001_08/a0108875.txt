Landscapes (the collection of habitats in a given area) have
              been dramatically altered in North America in recent decades, and can affect
              the ecology and genetic structure of species in a variety of ways.  The
              proposed research seeks to understand how landscape fragmentation affects
              demographic and genetic parameters of a migratory songbird, the black-throated
              blue warbler.  Information on birth, death, immigration, and emigration rates
              will be collected on 9 forest patches in Vermont that vary in level of
              landscape fragmentation.  Birds will be captured in nets, aged, sexed, and
              released, and then followed over the course of 2 years to estimate the vital
              rates across sites. 
 
Because fragmentation of continuous, natural
              landscapes is one of the most important factors contributing to the loss of
              biological diversity, it is a key issue in biological conservation.  The
              question of how landscape fragmentation affects the demography and evolution of
              vertebrate populations is of extreme interest to land management agencies that
              are mandated to maintain viable populations of native species.  The combined
              demographic and genetic approaches will yield insights into this important
              issue.  Two graduate and 10 undergraduate students will gain educational and
              field training at the University of Vermont and Washington State University.
