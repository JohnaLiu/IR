This dissertation research project by an
              anthropology student from the University of Michigan studies how children and
              adolescents learn about race in Belmonte, Bahia, Brazil.  The project advances
              our understanding of the interactions between child development and the
              cultural environment in social category formation. The research will synthesize
              two lines of work: cognitive psychology's studies of child development and
              anthropology's work on the social and historical construction of racial
              classification and inequality. The research design includes participant
              observation in schools, extra-school social and family settings;
              semi-structured interviews with a sample of family members of focal children
              and adolescents; and a racial census with two different conditions to
              understand the relation between biological systems of categorization and social
              identification based on phenotype as a function of age.  The information
              collected will shape anthropological theories of childhood and social
              categorization, and psychological notions of the universality of cognitive
              development. In addition the research advances our understanding of race
              relations in Brazil and contributes to the training of a young social
              scientist.
