Abstract    :
              J. T. Hynes of the University of Colorado is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to calculate reaction mechanisms and rates of
              proton transfer reactions in solution.  In addition, he will investigate the
              microscopic structure of surfaces and the dynamics of reactions upon them
              relevant to atmospheric ozone depletion.  All resulting theoretical predictions
              will be compared to corresponding experimental studies.

This research builds
              upon past efforts to use highly accurate theoretical calculations to
              investigate chemical reactions in condensed phase environments.  The results of
              this research will provide understanding of reaction classes central to
              chemistry, biochemistry, and atmospheric chemistry.
