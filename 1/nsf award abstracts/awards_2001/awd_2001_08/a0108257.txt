This award is to support travel of Dr. Nazmul Karim and Dr.
              Ranil Wickramasinghe, both in the Department of Chemical and Bioprocessing
              Engineering at Colorado State University, to Bangladesh.  They plan to meet
              with Dr. A.K.M.A. Quader, Professor and Head, Department of Chemical
              Engineering at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)
              in Dhaka.  They plan to develop a research project for removing arsenic from
              drinking water wells.  That project is to be submitted later to NSF for
              funding.   Their approach is to develop engineering methods to rid contaminated
              water from its arsenic, utilizing separation techniques currently being studied
              for other industrial applications.
