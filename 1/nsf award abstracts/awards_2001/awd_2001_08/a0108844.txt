Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              small, portable, low-power amperometric biosensor to detect phenol in
              wastewater.  A renewable, robust biosensor integrated into a microfluidic
              system is proposed and will be designed to specifically detect phenol in
              aqueous solutions based on an enzyme-based biosensor.  This method will allow
              analysis of phenol without significant dilution or reduction in the sensitivity
              of the detected species.  The microfluidic biosensor will use sol-gel modified,
              screen printed microband electrodes which will enhance the sensitivity and
              limit of detection of the device compared to electrodes of conventional size. 
              The device will also use a simple pump and valve system for both electrolyte
              and analyte introduction into the sensor and proven electrochemical
              instrumentation for phenol detection.  The proposed sensor will be applicable
              to real time, on-site monitoring of phenol concentrations in
              wastewater.


The commercial application of this project will be in
              industries such as pulp and paper, petroleum refining and plastic resins that
              need a cost effective and robust device to detect phenol in wastewater.
