Boron substitutes for Al in clay minerals with a
              relatively large isotope fractionation. Illite/smectite (I/S) clays incorporate
              more boron than other clay types and they are also most common in sedimentary
              basins. We want to test the hypothesis that the boron contents and isotopic
              ratios of these clays represent valuable monitors of the temperature and
              composition of the paleofluids from which they grew during burial to depths of
              hydrocarbon generation. Research on B in sediments has primarily focussed on
              the behavior of adsorbed-B and its variations as a function of T and pH.  As
              temperatures exceed 100 degrees C, however, the distribution coefficient for
              adsorbed-B approaches 0. Therefore, under diagenetic conditions it is more
              important to understand the fractionation of B during substitution in the clay
              mineral lattice. There is a large increase in the amount of interlayer-B in I/S
              during R1 ordering, when the layer charges cause partial collapse of smectite
              to form illite. Using a mannitol wash, followed by alkali cation saturation we
              were able to separate adsorbed, interlayer, and tetrahedral layer-B. Each
              population from different crystallographic sites had a different B-isotope
              ratio. Using this technique we will study the potential of B as a
              single-mineral geothermometer under low temperature conditions.
