Abstract    :
              Verdery / Chelcea
This dissertation research project by a cultural
              anthropologist from the University of Michigan studies the role of houses in
              maintaining and creating kinship relations during and after state socialism. 
              The student will compare the kinship relations of households in a neighborhood
              of Bucharest (Romania) whose houses were confiscated by the socialist state in
              1950 with those of households who managed to avoid this tragic process. Using
              data from archival research and intensive interviews with about 125 persons,
              the student will test four hypotheses relating family property and genealogical
              memory; the timing of housing appropriation by the state and the stage of the
              family cycle; the authority of household heads and the appropriation
              experience; and the effects of restitution process on kinship solidarity and
              conflict. The project will advance our understanding of the impact of state
              policies on kinship networks; will extend our understanding of the impact of
              privatization and restitution on people's conceptions of property rights; and
              will provide valuable comparative data for other former socialist countries
              experiencing restitution of previously nationalized property. In addition the
              project adds to the training of a young social scientist, and advances our
              knowledge of this important region of the world.
