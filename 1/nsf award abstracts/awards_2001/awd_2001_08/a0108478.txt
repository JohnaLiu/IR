Abstract    :
              Most multicellular organisms, like humans, form from a single cell.  By
              contrast, the social amoeba forms a multicellular body by aggregating
              individual cells from a small area.  This difference allows the investigators
              to evaluate genetic conflicts within an organism more easily than if they had
              to find new mutations.  The investigators will characterize the genetic
              variation in cells in a natural habitat, and will then investigate how these
              cells interact when they come together in a  multicellular individual.  They
              will evaluate how often some cell lines dominate over other cell lines, forcing
              them to die.

How cells interact with each other is an important question
              that bears on many fundamental problems in biology.  For example, cells that
              escape the control of other cells and continue to divide characterize cancer. 
              Programmed cell death is an important mechanism for ridding an organism of
              cells in the wrong place or that have certain kinds of defects.  When the
              social amoeba forms a fruiting body, some cells die while others live.
              Understanding the process whereby some cells escape the process of programmed
              cell death, and perhaps force other cells to die is of potential relevance to
              mechanisms for understanding cancer, and human developmental diseases.
