Turbulent Mixing, Internal Waves, and
              Intrusions: Effects on Resource Supply and Primary Productivity in
              Lakes

Turbulent eddies circulate phytoplankton through a gradient of light
              and supply nutrients from deep in a lake to the well-lit portions where
              phytoplankton grow.  Hence, the frequency and duration of turbulent events play
              an important role in governing the growth rates of phytoplankton.  Turbulence
              varies as a function of differences in the initial rates of heating after
              iceoff, wind forcing, and proximity to boundaries.  Because the study looks in
              depth at seasonal heat budgets, stream inflows, intrusions, internal waves, and
              temporal-spatial variability of turbulence, with concomitant biological
              measurements and experiments, results will provide a unique perspective on the
              role of physical processes in governing primary productivity and will allow
              better predictions of within lake changes due to global warming and human
              activities in lake basins.
