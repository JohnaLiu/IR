Abstract    :
              There is a National need to develop better-trained and educated physics and
              science teachers.  The PhysTEC project is an effort of the APS, AIP, and AAPT,
              to improve teacher preparation within physics departments at a set of selected
              Primary Program Institutions (PPIs).  The project PI's will work with six PPIs
              to produce a change in the way courses for pre-service teachers are taught at
              the university level and, by leveraging the clout and influence of professional
              associations, bridges will be built between physics and education departments
              on these campuses and eventually across the country.  The efforts of this
              proposal are an important opportunity to make significant changes in the way
              teacher are taught and encouraged to continue with science education. The
              proposal will involve both content-people and methods-people in cooperatively
              attacking problems encountered in the various institutions and would give
              attention to what has often been overlooked in science education. The proposal
              will deal with structuring the training of prospective teachers in ways that
              integrate content knowledge and pedagogy.  Also important are the mechanisms by
              which science faculty and school of education faculty can collaborate toward
              educating, encouraging and mentoring prospective science teachers for the
              future.
