Abstract    :
              This project aims to quantify the relationship of environmental variables to the
              spatial distribution and abundance of forest tree species in montane forest
              landscapes. Field studies will be conducted at sites in the western Cascades
              (OR), the Sierra Nevada (CA), the White Mountains (NH), and the Southern
              Appalachians (NC). These sites have exceptional baseline data sets that will be
              expanded for model development and validation during this project. Complex
              environmental gradients will be divided into component variables (topography,
              soils, climate).  Field studies will investigate forest establishment
              (including dispersal), growth, and death in response to those individual
              variables. A modeling framework will be used to synthesize forest response
              within and between sites. These models will be used to develop regionally
              nested sensitivity analyses indicating the relative importance of different
              environmental parameters and biotic variables in governing ecosystem responses.
              The results of this study will allow us to make more valid projections of
              possible forest response to environmental change.
