Detailed ecological data have been used to
              develop computer models of forest stands that have been applied to solve
              resource management issues. Increasingly, however, there is a need to answer
              questions that are relevant for larger areas, for example the impact of
              changing land use and of removing forest cover on habitat and water quality.
              This project will contribute to the methodology for scaling forest simulators
              into models of vegetation cover change in order to help answer those broad
              scale questions. Specifically, Dr. Acevedo and colleagues will develop methods
              to calculate the uncertainty associated with translating the model to larger
              areas, to scale the effect of neighboring vegetation patches, and to determine
              general mathematical functions of how those changes vary across a large
              landscape. The investigators will engage students in research as well as
              international collaboration with a team that is interdisciplinary and includes
              modelers, a mathematician, a computer scientist
