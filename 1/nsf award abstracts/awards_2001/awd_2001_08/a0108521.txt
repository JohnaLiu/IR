Abstract    :
              Professor Michael R. Detty in the Department of Chemistry at the State
              University of New York at Buffalo is supported by the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies incorporating organoselenides
              and tellurides into dendrimers.  In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, these
              compounds may function as mild oxidants.  These dendrimeric catalysts show
              potential as environmentally friendly oxidizing agents since the use of heavy
              metal oxidants and elemental halogens can be replaced by hydrogen
              peroxide.

With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Program,
              Professor Detty is developing catalysts which are mimics of halo- and
              thiolperoxidases, enzymes which catalyze the oxidation of halide salts and
              thiols, respectively.  These catalysts avoid the use of poisonous reagents and
              therefore are potentially valuable as environmentally benign alternatives to
              heavy metal oxidants or elemental halogens.
