Abstract    :
              This work will build on recent work by the PI on the multimodel superensemble
              approach for weather and climate forecasts. The principle of this technique
              contains a partitioning of the timeline with a control (training) and a
              forecast phase. Past results based on this technique have indicated that the
              superensemble outperforms in skill, multimodel forecasts, ensemble mean and
              climatology. The research will focus on the following areas: (1) to understand
              the basis for improved results from the multimodel superensemble for global
              numerical weather prediction, including hurricanes and forecasts of seasonal
              climate; (2) to further improve the methodology for the construction of
              superensemble forecasts; (3) to improve the initial state, i.e. superensemble
              of day 0 input for all variables for training and model validation; (4) to
              design and carry-out coupled atmosphere-ocean model based superensemble
              forecasts on seasonal to multiseasonal time scales; (5) to address the issue of
              sensitivity of superensemble forecast skills to perturbation of the training
              data base; and (6) to continue the preparation of real-time multimodel
              superensemble forecast data sets for global numerical weather prediction
              including hurricane track and intensity forecasts. The work is important
              because it has potential implications for prediction, both on weather and
              seasonal timescales, leading to great societal benefits.
