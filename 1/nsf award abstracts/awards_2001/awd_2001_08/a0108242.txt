Abstract    :
              Clonal reproduction, or the nonsexual production of new individuals, is
              widespread throughout both plant and animal species.  Existing theory fails to
              adequately address many important details of clonal life histories, including
              the existence of multiple levels of organization and opportunities for
              selection.  The overall aim is to expand evolutionary genetic models to
              incorporate these unique life history characteristics. Analytical models
              developed will combine both a population genetics framework (where, for
              example, allele frequencies in the entire population are followed) and
              demographic models (which incorporate details of the organism's particular life
              history).  Empirically derived demographic data will be used for further
              numerical analyses. In order to consider multiple levels of selection,
              individual-level fitness will reflect genetic diversity generated by the
              accumulation of mutations within the individual or clone.  Models will also be
              extended to populations that are structured in other ways (for example, spatial
              structure imposed by clonal growth). 

There are three major and unique
              strengths of the proposed research: (1) integration of classical population
              genetics theory with demographic models allows consideration of both genetic
              and ecological factors influencing selection, (2) combining empirical results
              with theoretical models allows a better and more realistic understanding of
              these genetic and ecological factors, and (3) the life history characteristics
              being considered are found in plants, in algae, and across at least two-thirds
              of metazoan animal phyla, including important marine invertebrates such as
              corals, making the results of this work widely applicable. By expanding
              existing population genetics theory to include organisms outside of those
              previously considered, the proposed research will provide crucial insight into
              processes such as mutation, selection at different levels of organization, and
              the origin and maintenance of genetic diversity.
