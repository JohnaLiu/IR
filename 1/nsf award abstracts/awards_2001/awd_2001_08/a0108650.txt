Abstract    :
              The overarching goal of this research is to investigate the critical features of
              ten nanometer (10x10-9m), zeptojoule (10-21J) terascale (1012) integration
              (ZTSI) that will enable switching energy reductions approximately five decades
              beyond those projected by the International Technology Roadmap for
              Semiconductors (ITRS) for the 50 nm generation of technology in 2011. The
              hierarchy of limits that govern future opportunities for terascale
              nanoelectronics will guide these advances. The five levels of this hierarchy
              have been codified as: 1) fundamental, 2) material, 3) device, 4) circuit, and
              5) system.  
The singular metric that characterizes a binary switching
              transition is the signal energy transfer (ES) that occurs during the
              transition. The minimum value of this energy ES(min) was recently derived and
              is given by (ln2)kT where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is absolute
              temperature.   Clearly, the values of both parameters, k and T, are independent
              of the properties of any materials, devices, or circuits that are used to
              implement a binary transition.  Consequently, the minimum value of the energy
              ES(min) becomes 2.88x 10-21   joules for T = 300K, defining the fundamental
              limit on binary switching energy.
On the basis of parameter values projected
              in the ITRS for the 50 nm generation of technology in 2011, calculation of
              system limits on gigascale integration (GSI) indicates that the system level
              limit on binary switching energy ES for the projected 10 GHz local clock
              frequency is approximately 2.88x10-16 joules.  The striking contrast that is
              immediately evident here is that the 2011, 50 nm generation system level binary
              switching energy ES of approximately 2.88x 10-16 joules is a factor of 105
              larger than the fundamental limit ES(min) of 2.88x 10-21 joules.  Discovering
              why this is so and what can be done with novel nanoelectronics to virtually
              eliminate this five-decade disparity is the salient objective of the proposed
              research.
