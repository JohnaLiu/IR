Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to understand the mechanisms responsible for
              dramatic fluctuations in the number of salamanders in subalpine wetlands in
              central Colorado.  Boom and bust cycles are often observed in animal
              populations, but such cycles are poorly understood in amphibians.  A
              combination of approaches including long-term monitoring of salamander
              reproduction and survival in natural populations, field experiments that
              manipulate food (aquatic invertebrates) and other resources, and laboratory
              studies will be used to study mechanisms that could lead to population cycles. 
              These data will be used to construct mathematical models to determine which
              mechanisms are capable of producing long-term the fluctuations in population
              size observed in this amphibian. 

The decline of amphibians around the world
              is of great concern to ecologists, and it is important to be able to
              distinguish natural causes of change in amphibian populations from those
              related to human activities.  Salamanders are the native top predators in
              subalpine wetlands and it is well documented that they play a key role in
              determining how many and which invertebrates coexist in the food web.  This
              research is a first step towards understanding how cycles in the number of
              salamanders will affect the foodwebs and ultimately the functioning of these
              remote, pristine, ecosystems.
