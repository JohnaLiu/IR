The objective of this research is to use prehistoric
              information to test ideas about why animal populations are distributed as they
              are across modern landscapes.  Geographic variation of modern species
              contributes to our understanding of population biology.  The research is
              important because few opportunities exist to use historic samples to
              investigate population structure in naturally functioning ecosystems through
              time.  This study will use fossil and modern specimens to trace two rodent
              species (pocket gophers and montane voles) through the last several thousand
              years in the northern Rocky Mountains.  The work will reveal which aspects of a
              species' life history, such as dispersal ability, litter size and social
              organization, must be considered in the analysis of long-term population
              genetic data.  The fossil deposits span several climatic warming and cooling
              events, thus providing a context for investigating species response to
              environmental change.

This study is the first in the burgeoning field of
              ancient DNA to analyze sequential fossil populations through thousands of
              years.  In assessing genetic variation through time and across geographic
              space, this study will deepen our understanding of processes underlying the
              history and future survival of species.  Results will provide a historical
              context for how mammals with different life histories respond to climatic
              change.
