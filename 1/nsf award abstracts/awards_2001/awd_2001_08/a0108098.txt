Abstract    :
              Karin Ruhlandt-Senge, Department of Chemistry, Syracuse University, is supported
              by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for her
              work with organometallic complexes of calcium, strontium and barium.
              Sigma-bonded alkyls, aryls and thiolates can be prepared and studied by using
              ancillary ligands that can stabilize these large, highly electrophilic metal
              centers. One important goal of this work is to obtain details about the ionic
              or covalent character of the metal-carbon or metal-sulfur bond and to
              investigate periodic trends down the alkaline earth family. Another goal is to
              exploit the unique reactivity of these complexes to prepare desirable organic
              structures. 

Fundamental studies of bonding and reactivity of these alkaline
              earth compounds will lead to an increased understanding of the organometallic
              chemistry of these relatively unexplored metals. In addition, undergraduate and
              graduate students involved in the work will learn valuable skills in synthesis,
              characterization and catalysis by studying these reactive species.
