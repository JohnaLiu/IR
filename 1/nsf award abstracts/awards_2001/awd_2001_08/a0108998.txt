Abstract    :
              

Control theory witnessed explosive growth in the latter half of the 20th
              century.   The field matured into an elegant and rigorous scientific discipline
              as a result of developments in linear quadratic optimal control, geometric
              structure theory, robustness analysis and synthesis, H-infinity and L1 optimal
              control.  

The invited speakers include many pioneering researchers who
              created or contributed to, some of the above fields.  The workshop will provide
              the opportunity for this outstanding group of system and control scientists to
              assemble and discuss the status of the field.  Its impact on the course of this
              discipline cannot be overstated.  For this reason we plan to assemble the
              papers presented at the Workshop in book form.
