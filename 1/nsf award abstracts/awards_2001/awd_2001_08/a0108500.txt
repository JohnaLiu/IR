Abstract    :
              This research concerns the role of genetic variation at metabolic enzyme genes
              in the adaptation to heterogeneous environments.  Recent work has shown that
              acorn barnacles (Semibalanus balanoides) carrying alternative forms of the
              enzyme encoded by the MPI gene experience different survivorship at opposite
              ends of the environmental gradient between high- and low-tide zones.  Other
              genetic markers in the acorn barnacle genome do not show this pattern, thus
              implicating natural selection at or near the MPI gene.  The investigators
              propose to clone the MPI gene, determine its DNA sequence, and identify the
              specific changes in MPI that confer the habitat-specific survivorship of the
              two enzyme forms.  This will be achieved by DNA sequence analyses of the two
              forms of the MPI gene, by analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the
              gene that vary between tide zones, and through growth and survivorship
              experiments in a flowing sea water lab where thermal stress and dietary sugars
              important in MPI function are manipulated. 

The goal of this research is to
              understand the functional significance of genetic variation in heterogeneous
              environments.  All organisms face environmental unpredictability; how they
              respond to this uncertainty through genetic adaptations is a fundamental
              problem in the biological sciences.  In barnacles, two crucial environmental
              variables are thermal and desiccation stress.  Because these stresses will
              increase in the future, this barnacle model may help us understand the genetic
              impacts of climate change.
