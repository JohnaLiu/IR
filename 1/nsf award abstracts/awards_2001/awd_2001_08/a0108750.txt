Abstract    :
              Professor Paul W. Bohn and Dr. Carlyle B. Storm are funded through the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry program to help fund the 2001 Gordon
              Conference on Analytical Chemistry.  This conference is focused on chemical
              analysis and materials chemistry.  The program aims to draw together leading
              scientists in both fields with young scientists and those from underrepresented
              groups to discuss how analytical methods can solve problems in materials
              science.   The meeting is to be held in June 2001.
