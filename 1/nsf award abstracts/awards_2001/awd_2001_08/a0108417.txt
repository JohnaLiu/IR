CRB:  MECHANISMS OF VOLE SUPPRESION OF TALL GRASS
              DICOTS

Experimental restoration uses land reclamation techniques to test
              fundamental ecological theory, and thereby inform management practices.  Here,
              we propose to maintain a highly successful example of such an attempt to (1)
              determine the mechanism of suppression of tallgrass vegetation by voles, and
              (2) follow the study for sufficient time to detect an anticipated numerical
              response by prairie species.  Selective herbivory by voles can reduce the
              biomass of preferred forage species and reduce plant diversity.  Subsequent
              increases in voles to peak densities can have an ungulate-like effect, with up
              to a 98% reduction in standing crop in vole-accessible plots compared to the
              situation in vole-protected areas.  To evaluate the mechanism of suppression
              that explains why target species are reduce to rosettes in some plots but
              manage to grow, flower, and seed in others, we will use individual hardware
              cloth exclosures that protect shoots of target species as they emerge, with a
              scheduled removal of protection at two week intervals.  The experiment will be
              maintained for three years, thereby allowing an asssessment of the numerical
              response of prairie species./
