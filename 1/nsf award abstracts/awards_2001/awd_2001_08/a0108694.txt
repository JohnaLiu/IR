Abstract    :
              This project addresses basic issues of materials at nanoscale dimensions. The
              research will investigate thermodynamic properties of Si nanostructures and
              silicide interfaces using a new and highly sensitive calorimetric device. For
              example, the phenomenon of melting point depression for surface-supported
              particles  can be measured for particles as small as 1000 atoms.
The focus is
              on understanding unique properties and behavior of nanometer-sized materials.
              The approach is to measure thermodynamic properties of Si nanostructures and
              silicide interfaces including structural stability and heat capacity to
              establish a more complete picture of the material physics of structures at
              these dimensions. Earlier investigations of magic number(integers of atomic
              layers) nanostructures from metals to semiconductor Si nanostructures will be
              extended by measuring the specific heat, melting temperature, and associated
              enthalpy, as well as particle size using TEM.

The project addresses
              basic research issues in a contemporary topical area of materials science with
              high potential significance and technological relevance. An important feature
              of the program is the integration of research and education through the
              training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.
              The project is expected to provide unique opportunities for graduate and
              undergraduate students to develop strong technical, communication, and
              organizational/management skills through unique experiences made possible by a
              forefront research environment.
