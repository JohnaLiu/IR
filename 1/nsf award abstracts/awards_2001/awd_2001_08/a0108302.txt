Abstract    :
              Understanding how local and regional processes balance to regulate species
              diversity is a fundamental goal in ecology. Our research will examine the
              relative significance of local-scale ecological interactions and species
              availability in governing relationships between grassland plant diversity, soil
              nutrient supply, and habitat productivity. We will conduct two factorial field
              experiments concurrently within a Kansas grassland. In experiment 1, we will
              directly manipulate soil nutrient supply and plant productivity by applying
              nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers to field plots. We will manipulate species
              availability through the use of multi-species seed additions. In experiment 2,
              we will manipulate species availability via seed additions in plots arrayed
              across a natural grassland productivity gradient. With these complimentary
              approaches, we seek to test a set of predictions regarding: (1) how the pool of
              available colonists affects the relationship between plant diversity and
              productivity; (2) how nitrogen and phosphorus supply interact to influence the
              nature of the diversity-productivity relationship; and (3) how species
              availability influences rates and pathways of vegetation succession under
              different conditions of nutrient supply and productivity. We are seeking new
              insights into the organization of plant communities as well as an enhanced
              understanding of the processes governing the development of
              diversity-productivity patterns in grasslands.
