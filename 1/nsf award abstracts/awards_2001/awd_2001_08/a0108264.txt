Abstract    :
              The Third International Symposium on Radiative Transfer will be held June 17-22,
              2001 in Antalya, Turkey.  Funds will be used for travel by six emerging
              scientists for their participation in the Symposium.  Three pre-tenure faculty
              and three doctoral students whose research focus is in the area of radiative
              heat transfer will be invited.  Each will be expected to participate fully in
              the Symposium, by submitting and presenting some aspect of their research
              activity for review.  The invited participants will receive partial travel
              support which will cover a portion of the estimated Symposium travel expenses,
              with the expectation that the remainder will be provided either from the
              participant's own funds or the participant's institution.
