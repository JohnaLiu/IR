Abstract    :
              All plants need to acquire at least 15 elements from their environment including
              carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur.  In addition to these element
              resources, plants also require light and water.  Although the relative
              requirement for these resources by plants remains relatively constant, their
              relative availability in the environment can vary drastically in both space and
              time.  Plants must therefore adjust to this variability in resource
              availability to maintain a balanced nutrition.  The relative success of various
              species in making this adjustment will in part determine the productivity of
              the ecosystem, the composition of the plant community, the species diversity,
              the rates of nutrient cycling, and the rate of CO2 storage or loss.  In this
              grant, a theoretical foundation is established for understanding the complex
              interactions among multiple resources and the consequences of these
              interactions on species, on communities of plants, and on ecosystem processes
              like nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration.  The theory is then tested
              using data from the Arctic Tundra Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in
              northern Alaska.
