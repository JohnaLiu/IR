This Americas Program award will provide support for
              dissertation research by Mr. George E. Luber, under the direction of Dr. Elois
              A. Berlin of the University of Georgia.  Mr. Luber will work in Mexico with Dr.
              Austraberta Nazar Beutelspacher at El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, in Chiapas. 
              They will study the biological pathology and the cultural construction of
              illness by carrying out a comparative, cross-cultural study of two folk
              illnesses.
Specifically, this thesis dissertation research will investigate
              two folk illnesses, the Tzeltal Mayan cha'lam tsots and the Mixe metsk kuaay,
              which represent regional variations of cultural representations of potentially
              fatal illnesses, primarily affecting children, found in several Mesoamerican
              cultures. The research will involve a combination of ethnographic, clinical
              epidemiological and nutritional anthropometric methods to address a critical
              gap in the biocultural study of ethnomedical systems by clarifying the role
              that biology and culture each play in the identification and cultural
              construction of disease in two Mesoamerican linguistic groups.  By working with
              researchers at El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, this study will increase
              understanding of and improve efforts to develop culturally-appropriate and
              effective treatments for these and other ethnomedical conditions often ignored
              and untreated by local doctors.
