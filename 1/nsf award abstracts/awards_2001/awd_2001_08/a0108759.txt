Recent cruises to the Ross Sea
              under the JGOFS and ROAVERRS programs have documented that the removal of
              dissolved carbon and nutrients can be significantly different from the ratios
              predicted from typical Redfield ratios (e.g. 106:16:1 for C:N:P) for seawater
              particulates.  The non-Redfield nutrient removal ratios were associated with
              phytoplankton species composition.  For example, C:N:P uptake ratios determined
              from measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon, nitrate and phosphate were ca.
              80:10:1 in diatom-dominated stations and ca. 140:20:1 for Phaeocystis
              antarctica-dominated stations.  Non-Redfield dynamics could be critical for
              understanding the biogeochemistry of the geological record as well as
              predicting the impacts of climate change.  Samples are to be collected from a
              ship of opportunity during a geophysics cruise (NBP 01-01, Hobart to Capetown)
              to the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean.  Species composition will be
              quantified by microscopy from preserved water samples.  Nutrient concentrations
              (nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, and silicate) will be measured from frozen
              sampled collected in conjunction with water a sampling program that is to be
              conducted to study carbon dynamics.  These "samples of opportunity" will
              provide a data set to be used in evaluating whether the non-Redfield situation
              observed in the Ross Sea occurs in distant coastal systems around Antarctica,
              and whether it is associated with the same species or similar oceanographic
              conditions.
