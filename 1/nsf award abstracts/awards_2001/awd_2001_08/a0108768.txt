This is a workshop proposal submitted by Dr. Clyde Goulden,
              Academy of Natural Science of Philadelphia, to request travel expenses to
              enable 12 U.S. scientists to attend the meeting of the East Asian Long-Term
              Ecological Research Network in Ulaanbaatar, and then presentations and field
              experiments at Hatgal on Lake Hovsgol, Mongolia, from July 2-10, 2001.  
              Mongolia lies in the transition zone between the cold continental desert, and
              the taiga boreal forest of Siberia.  The Mongolian LTER (MLTER) includes
              ecosystems of the Gobi, semi-desert, steppe/forest, taiga forest, and
              freshwater habitats, and is an important network for global environmental
              research. The scheduled activities include focused presentations, hands-on
              research training and in-situ field measurements in a range of ecosystems.  
              The purpose of this workshop is to exchange research results in ecology and to
              foster collaboration among the scientists from the U.S. and East Asia.  The NSF
              and the Mongolian National Academy of Science jointly support this
              workshop.
