Abstract    :
              Accurate cross section data are essential for detailed modeling of the behavior
              of the upper atmosphere.  This directly addresses this need by seeking to
              provide data for atmospheric species at the relevant energies.  Experiments
              will be continued on collisions of keV-energy oxygen and hydrogen atoms and
              ions with atomic oxygen and atomic hydrogen and on electron-impact ionization
              of molecules.  A new experiment to measure charge transfer cross sections for
              oxygen ions with atmospheric species at energies down to a few electron-volts
              is also proposed.
