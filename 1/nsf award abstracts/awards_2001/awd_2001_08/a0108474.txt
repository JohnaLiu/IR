CONSEQUENCES OF COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND NUTRIENT SUPPLY RATE 
FOR DYNAMIC
              RESPONSES TO PERTURBATION:  THEORY AND EXPERIMENTS

The ability to accurately
              predict how ecological systems respond to perturbation is a major goal of
              ecology.  Although ecologists have developed a rich body of theory regarding
              which properties of ecological systems might be reliable predictors of dynamics
              following perturbation, there are two major gaps in this theory.  First, there
              have been relatively few experimental tests of theoretical expectations,
              despite the applied importance of such tests.  Second, most studies have
              focused on "removal" perturbations that involve loss of accumulated biomass,
              such as hurricanes that knock down trees and stream scouring events that remove
              biota.  However, many ecosystems are also subjected to "addition" perturbations
              such as nutrient pulses.  An important question, therefore, is whether theory
              developed for removal perturbations is also applicable to addition
              perturbations. 

This research project  addresses both needs through field
              experiments and simulation modeling.  The experiments will test theoretical
              predictions in freshwater plankton communities, whereas modeling studies will
              determine if current theory applies to nutrient pulses.  Together, these
              studies will result in a more broadly based theory for how ecosystems respond
              to perturbations, increased understanding of the short-term responses of algae
              to nutrient pulses, and an evaluation of the possible indirect effects of
              common lake management practices on algal dynamics.
