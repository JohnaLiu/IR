Abstract    :
              The main objective of this project is to organize UNIF 2001,
the 15th
              International Workshop on Unification.

Unification is concerned with the
              problem of identifying given 
terms, either syntactically or modulo a given
              logical theory. 
Syntactic unification is the basic operation of most
              automated 
reasoning systems, and unification modulo theories can be
              used,
for instance, to build in special equational theories into 
theorem
              provers. 

UNIF 2001 will be the latest in a series of annual
              international
workshops on unification, the previous ones having been mostly
              in 
Europe (France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) and twice in the US.

The aim
              of UNIF 2001, as that of the previous meetings, is to 
bring together people
              interested in unification, present recent 
(even unfinished) work, and discuss
              new ideas and trends in 
unification and related fields.

In particular, it
              is intended to offer a good opportunity for 
young researchers and researchers
              working in related areas to get 
an overview of the current state of the art
              in unification theory
and get in contact with the experts in the field.

In
              addition to researchers from automated reasoning and term 
rewriting, the
              traditional participants to UNIF, this year's 
workshop will try to attract
              also researchers from theoretical 
computer science working on unification
              algorithms for special 
theories (such as associativity) where astonishing
              progress has 
been achieved in the last two years.

The workshop will also
              try to facilitate, with travel awards and 
registration fee waivers, the
              participation of young researchers 
from the United States. The intent of this
              is to stimulate research
on unification in this country, as well as alert US
              researchers 
working in automated reasoning and verification to recent results
              
in this field.
