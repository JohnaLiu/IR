Abstract    :
              
The role of predation in regulating terrestrial ecosystems, and the related
              question of whether terrestrial ecosystems are subject to strong trophic
              cascades (effects which flow from predators through herbivores to plants) are
              topics of current debate in ecology.  The proposed research takes advantage of
              a multi-billion dollar "experiment" that has created a large number of
              predator-free islands in a 4,300 square-kilometer impoundment associated with a
              hydroelectric installation in Venezuela.  The proposed research generally tests
              the hypothesis that the predator-free status of islands should lead initially
              to a hyper-abundance of herbivores (seed and leaf eating species), and then to
              massive impacts on the vegetation as a consequence of trophic cascades. 
              Primary activities include continuing rodent and ant removal programs on
              experimental islands and re-censusing plant plots to record the dynamics of
              vegetation change on both untreated and treated islands.  This research may
              provide the most direct link yet to the important functional role played by
              large predators in tropical forests.  This has enormous implications for
              conservation because human-induced loss of predators from tropical forests may
              drastically alter plant species composition of tropical forests resulting in
              significant declines in diversity.
