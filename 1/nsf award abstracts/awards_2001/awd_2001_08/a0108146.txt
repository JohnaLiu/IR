Abstract    :
              LTREB:  MANGROVE FOREST STRUCTURE AND GAP DYNAMICS:  EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF THE
              ROLES OF COMPETITION AND HERBIVORY

The proposed research continues long-term
              monitoring of the patterns and mechanisms of gap regeneration in mangrove
              forests on the Caribbean coast of Panama, and their effects on forest structure
              and stability.  Fieldwork includes sampling vegetation in a variety of
              permanent plots and transects along a tidal gradient as well as in natural
              light gaps.  Soil physicochemical characteristics and the light environment
              will be monitored to evaluate if changes in vegetation are associated with
              changes in abiotic characteristics.   This study includes a number of field
              experiments that test hypotheses that have been proposed to explain mangrove
              zonation, including the Physiological Specialization, Included Niche
              Competition, Tidal Sorting and Dominance-Predation hypotheses.  In addition, an
              herbivore exclusion experiment will assess the impact of insect folivores and
              stem-borers on the growth, survival, and distribution of species along the
              tidal gradient, as well as the mediating effect of herbivory on interspecific
              competition.  In general, these studies will advance our understanding of the
              interactions of disturbance with competition and herbivory in structuring
              natural ecosystems, and thereby contribute to our ability to predict the
              ecological consequences of various human-caused alterations of these endangered
              wetlands.
