Abstract    :
              Every year, Americans use more and more chemicals to maintain their homes and
              yards.  Concern is increasing that pesticides and other toxic chemicals are
              harming living things -- ourselves, our families, our pets, and the natural
              world around us.  The current research project poses the questions, "why do we
              use so many chemicals?" and "can we get people to reduce unnecessary use of
              toxic products?"  We want to understand motivations for using toxic products. 
              

This project also helps County Health Departments educate citizens about
              the dangers of toxic products.  It emphasizes reducing the danger in several
              ways: 
1. teaching people about effective nontoxic alternatives they can use
              instead of harsh chemicals;
2. teaching proper storage for safety and to
              maintain the chemical's effectiveness (instead of letting chemicals become
              ineffective when they freeze or cook in the garage);
3. encouraging people to
              use up leftovers instead of disposing of them;
4. encouraging people to give
              away leftovers instead of disposing of them; and 
5. for leftovers that cannot
              be used up or shared, teaching people about proper disposal, such as at
              county-maintained household hazardous waste facilities.  

The project uses
              informal group meetings as the setting for discussing these and other issues. 
              During the 2.5 years we developed this educational approach, we noticed
              considerable variability in how audiences responded.  A primary purpose of the
              current project is to see if we can identify what features of the audience,
              leader, or discussion seem to yield the  most educated and satisfied
              participants.
