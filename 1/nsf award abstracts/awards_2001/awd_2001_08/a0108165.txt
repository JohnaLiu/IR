Abstract    :
              This project focuses on theories of parental investment strategy that predict
              different patterns of size distributions in offspring.  This one-year,
              Proof-of-Concept grant will examine variance in size of males and females in
              natural populations of ants.  The work will consist of: (1) Collections of
              specimens from the area surrounding the Sierra Nevada Aquatic Research Lab and
              at Stunt Ranch in the Santa Monica Mountains; (2) Morphometric measurement of
              specimens; and (3) Sophisticated statistical analyses of data to detect
              patterns.

The project will examine a fundamental trade-off facing parents in
              their reproductive strategy: quantity of offspring (in terms of total numbers)
              versus quality (in terms of individual size of offspring).  Older theoretical
              models predict that size should not vary.  Parents should make all offspring
              roughly the same size.  Newer models, however, identify conditions under which
              it is often advantageous to also vary offspring size.  Ants are ideal for
              testing these competing ideas because colonies are plentiful and produce many
              offspring per year (i.e., patterns are readily identifiable).  The results,
              however, will be relevant across all species, and a greater understanding of
              parental behavior will provide insight into the growth and regulation of
              species populations.
