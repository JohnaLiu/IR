Abstract    :
              Simmons College, a predominantly undergraduate women's college, and the
              Materials Research Science and Engineering Center at Cornell University
              establish a partnership to develop opportunities for science students at
              Simmons to participate in materials-related research throughout their
              undergraduate careers. The overall thrust of the project focuses on
              establishing a collaborative Simmons/Cornell research program on organic
              electroluminescent materials that provides opportunities for students to work
              with faculty on timely research projects, have access to sophisticated
              instrumentation, and gain related work experience in industrial settings.
              Another goal of the project is to interest female undergraduates in
              participating in material research and to encourage them to consider further
              career explorations in this area. 

This project establishes a model
              relationship between a predominantly undergraduate institution and a large
              research university and its federally funded research Center. The undergraduate
              institution enhances its research efforts through increased access to
              collaborators and instrumentation at the large research university. The latter
              benefits from enhanced recruitment access to a talented pool of undergraduates
              and from opportunities for its graduate students to interact with undergraduate
              faculty and to consider a postgraduate career at an undergraduate institution.
