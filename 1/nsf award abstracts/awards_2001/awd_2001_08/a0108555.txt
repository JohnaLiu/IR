A grant has been awarded to Drs.
              Jimmy A. McGuire of Louisiana State University and Robert Dudley of the
              University of Texas at Austin to investigate the role that morphology and
              physiology have played in the evolution of flight performance in hummingbirds.
              More specifically, they will generate a phylogenetic tree describing the
              species-level genealogy for 300 species of hummingbirds and will then use this
              genealogy as the framework for comparative analysis. To produce this tree, they
              will sequence five genes (one mitochondrial and 4 nuclear) and then analyze
              these genetic data by applying a recently developed model-based method of
              phylogenetic analysis. In the second component of the project, they are
              measuring flight performance across the diversity of hummingbirds to evaluate
              how variation in morphological design affects locomotor performance, and how
              hummingbirds that occur at high elevation compensate for reduced air density
              and oxygen content in this aerodynamically challenging environment. 

The
              phylogenetic analysis is not only critical for statistical analysis of flight
              performance data, but will also be invaluable to the larger community of
              evolutionary biologists that utilize hummingbirds as the "model system" for
              their own investigations. This work is also of general importance because it
              will substantially improve current understanding of animal flight by utilizing
              comparative performance data. These data are extremely difficult to obtain for
              other vertebrate species, but tractable in hummingbirds because of their use of
              hovering flight.
