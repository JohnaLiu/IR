Abstract    :
              The goal of this research effort is to improve understanding of the role of
              air-sea interactions in modifying the near-surface wind structure of tropical
              cyclones.  Of particular importance is to understand the role of these
              interactions as tropical cyclones pass over warm oceanic features that surround
              the United States Eastern Seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico states.  

Specific
              research objectives are: 

1.  Develop techniques to improve estimates of
              upper ocean heat content from in situ and radar altimetry data.
2.  Examine
              the forcing of warm ocean features on surface stresses, fluxes and waves in the
              atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and the role of the ocean mixed layer (OML)
              feedback to the ABL.
3.  Quantify the roles of mixing and horizontal advection
              of temperature and salinity, including the mass, heat and salt budgets in the
              OML and the effects of precipitation on the OML.

Successful completion of
              this research will lead to a better understanding of the role of warm upper
              oceanic features on surface wind variations.  This may lead to improved
              boundary layer parameterizations and improved hurricane intensity forecasts.
