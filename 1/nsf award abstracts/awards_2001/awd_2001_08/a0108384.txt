Abstract    :
              
Insectivorous bats are a highly diverse yet vulnerable component of vertebrate
              diversity in Old World rainforests.  Nowhere is this more evident than in
              peninsular Malaysia, a critical country for bat conservation, with over 100
              known species and local richness in excess of 50 species.  Bats that are highly
              specialized and dependent on rainforests represent an exceptionally diverse
              group in Malaysia (> 40 species) and are of particular conservation concern. 
              They are poorly suited for prey detection and forage in more open habitats that
              arise from disturbance events.  As a consequence, they are likely to experience
              a severe decline in diversity as forest habitats are lost or become fragmented.
               This project will establish the Malaysian Bat Conservation Research Unit,
              comprising U.S. and Malaysian researchers.  The mission of the unit includes:
              1) long-term research on bat diversity and conservation; 2) the development and
              acquisition of skills and resources in the host country; and 3) implementation
              of a local and web-based education program to highlight the diversity and
              biology of bats, as well as the international importance of Malaysia to bat
              conservation. Research will focus on establishing how patterns of species
              abundance and distribution vary across space and time in undisturbed forest,
              and identifying the ecological processes that influence these patterns. To this
              end, we will intensively survey six bat communities within an area of
              contiguous primary forest and implement radio-tracking studies to test the
              influence of roosting and foraging ecology on bat abundance and distribution. 
              Both research foci are key considerations for the development of conservation
              programs to protect this unique fauna.
