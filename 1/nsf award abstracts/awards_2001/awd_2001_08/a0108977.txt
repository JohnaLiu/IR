Tourism is one of the world's major industries,
              and the impact of this industry upon local cultures is an enduring field of
              study. This dissertation research involves an anthropology student from the
              University of Georgia studying the role of river-based tourism (whitewater
              rafting) in local communities in Nepal.  The student will study rafting company
              owners, river guides, and local river villages as well as the rafting tourism
              clients.  The study will elicit the major costs and benefits of the river
              tourism industry from each of these groups of stakeholders; assess the level of
              agreement about the social, environmental and economic costs and benefits
              within and between each group using consensus analysis; and compare the
              economic contributions made by clients of river tourism along two rivers, one
              of shorter and one of longer trip duration. The research will advance our
              understanding of the role of river tourism in the subsistence of local
              villagers and gather data to help assess the impact of planned changes in the
              river environment.  In addition it will advance the anthropological methodology
              of consensus analysis, a way of analyzing the knowledge of a group of persons
              about a defined topic; will contribute to the training of a young social
              scientist, and advance our understanding of this important region of the world.
