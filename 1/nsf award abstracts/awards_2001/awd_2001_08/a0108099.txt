Abstract    :
              
A central problem in plant biology is understanding when and how separate
              sexes evolve from hermaphroditism.  Recent research has pin-pointed the
              environment as an important element mediating this transition, however, little
              attention has been paid to the enemy dimension of the environment. The
              objective of this research is to evaluate the role of herbivory in the
              evolution of separate sexes from hermaphroditism using the wild strawberry and
              it's flower bud clipping herbivore as a model system.  This research will test
              a long standing hypothesis for how male-biased herbivory could facilitate the
              evolution of separate genders as well as four newly developed  hypotheses for
              how herbivory could impede this transition.  These hypotheses will be tested
              using a combination of greenhouse and experimental garden studies. Herbivore
              levels will be manipulated and fitness through male and female function will be
              measured.  These studies will be complemented by direct measures of the
              response to selection.

This work will expand our understanding of the
              plant-animal interactions governing the evolution of separate genders to
              include enemies. In doing so, it will provide some of the first data on the
              role of antagonists in breeding system evolution.  Moreover, because this study
              utilizes a wild relative of an agricultural species and one of its most
              damaging  pests, data gathered on resistance and tolerance in this system will
              be relevant to development of alternatives to pesticide use in managed
              settings.
