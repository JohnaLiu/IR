Abstract    :
              Climate patterns are changing rapidly as evidenced by increases in temperature
              associated with global warming and in annual variability in weather conditions.
               The impacts of such changes on animal populations are not well understood, but
              can be assessed with long-term demographic studies that take advantage of
              temporal and spatial variation in weather across environmental gradients.  This
              proposal intensively examines the demographic responses of the Black-throated
              Blue Warbler, as well as other bird species at larger geographic scales, and
              quantifies annual shifts in spatial distribution and abundance.  The 800 m
              elevational gradient at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in the White
              Mountains provides a breadth of environmental conditions needed to compare the
              effects of intra- and inter-annual differences in local weather conditions and
              biotic factors (e.g., food abundance and predator density) on bird population
              dynamics and reproductive performance.  Such information is key to assessing
              the potential local effects of climate change on bird populations, and
              ultimately to predicting how these populations and communities will respond in
              the future to climate-induced environmental change associated with human
              activities.
