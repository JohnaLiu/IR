Abstract    :
              The researh project by Dr. Robin McCarley of Louisiana State University entitled
              "Stabilized Molecular Assemblies" is supported by the Analytical and Surface
              Chemistry Program.  The goal of the research is to control the 2-dimensional
              polymerization of dendrimer assemblies and then to utilize the macromolecule as
              a container for specific guest molecules, which can be released through
              electron-transfer chemistry.  The investigator will  study the macromolecule
              formation as well as, the trapping and release properties of the oligomers. A
              key objective is the development of selective traps with reversible release
              properties.  This research represents an extension of the investigator's prior
              work, while also branching out into new fields of exploration.

The ability
              to control the isolation, storage and release of small molecules has many
              potential applications with potential for societal impact.  These polymerized
              dendrimers may have utility for the preconcentration of specific target
              molecules, as nanoscopic sensors, as new materials and for drug delivery.  A
              thorough and fundamental study of the chemistry and performance of these
              materials is significant.
