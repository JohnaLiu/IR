Abstract    :
              This Small Busuness Innovation Research (SBIR) project will develop an initial
              prototype design for a cavitation probe that uses the property of a collapsing
              cavitation bubble to produce visible photons (sonoluminescence) has been
              designed and constructed. These light emissions can be easily detected within a
              small, finite volume and thus this probe provides a direct means of measuring
              the cavitation density (activity/per unit volume) within a cavitating fluid and
              the delivery of ultrasonic energy at an engineered surface. As a result,
              ultrasonic methods treating a surface can be directly monitored and controlled
              in real-time, leading to the ability to improve and predict the performance of
              the resulting structure. For example, since cavitation is thought to be the
              principal mechanism that leads to particle removal from silicon wafers during
              an ultrasonic/megasonic cleaning operation, it is likely that a strong
              correlation exists between cavitation probe output and cleaning effectiveness.
              Thus, this probe provides the potential for constructing a real-time monitor of
              ultrasonic/megasonic cleaner efficiency and effectiveness. In addition, because
              the entire three-dimensional cavitation field can be measured with this probe,
              it can also serve as a useful tool in ultrasonic/megasonic cleaner design.

A
              real-time cavitation-density measuring device would have great utility in the
              semiconductor cleaning industry and thus this probe provides considerable
              promise for commercial development.
