Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              innovative technologies for smart infrastructure, and in particular coordinated
              wireless sensors and control devices. The first smart wireless devices will
              focus on measurement and control of environmental parameters such as
              temperature and humidity, although these devices are archetypes for a wider
              range of smart components. The behavior of the smart devices will be
              coordinated by the MetaOS, a software system developed by Ambient Computing,
              Inc. to provide traditional operating system functions to fully distributed
              collections of smart computing and networking devices. The system will
              demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of connected and
              coordinated smart devices.  The early commercial applications of the proposed
              work will focus on improvement of energy consumption and personalization of
              environmental parameters. Existing means of addressing these problems are
              highly proprietary, difficult and expensive to deploy, and have limited
              flexibility. The proposed more advanced systems will lead to significant
              reduction in overall energy consumption while providing personal comfort and
              financial benefits to consumers. 

This effort aims to build some of the
              missing and necessary pieces for smart environments, specifically, small and
              low-cost wireless devices with integrated computing capabilities.
