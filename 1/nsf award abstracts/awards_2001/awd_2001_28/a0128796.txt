Hedges
This award supports John Hedges and students from Washington
              University in a collaboration with Gerhard Kattner of the Alfred Wegener
              Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany.  The project will have several foci,
              including the study of export of organic matter from rivers to the ocean,
              biogeochemistry of tropical systems, dynamics of dissolved organic matter in
              natural waters, and preservation of organic materials in marine sediments. 
              Both groups are actively developing analytical methods for organic materials in
              environmental samples.  In particular, the project will produce a method for
              analysis of the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of individual
              amino acids and their stereoisomers.  In addition, the US group will learn the
              high-performance liquid chromatographic method now practiced by the AWI group
              fro ultra-sensitive analysis of amino acids as well as their methods for
              characterizing the molecular weight distribution of samples of dissolved
              organic matter.  The work plan provides for extensive participation by graduate
              students in the international travel and research.
