Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              compositions of nanocomposite metal oxide catalysts for use in automotive
              catalytic converters. Such nanocomposite catalysts will potentially lower
              emissions of polluting gases, such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons and
              nitrogen oxides (NOx) particularly in the initial warm-up phase of engine
              operation. With more stringent regulations on mobile source emissions, the need
              for improved catalytic conversion has become a major priority for research
              efforts worldwide. The key task will be to develop the ceria-based
              nanocomposites suitably doped with highly dispersed noble metal (Pt or Pd) to
              achieve highly active and thermally stable performance at costs comparable to
              conventional catalysts. 

The proposed project will have a major impact on
              commercial and consumer automotive applications. Catalytic converters are used
              in nearly all gasoline-powered automobiles. Improvement in catalytic converter
              efficiency will have significant environmental impacts on the mobile air
              pollution sources.
