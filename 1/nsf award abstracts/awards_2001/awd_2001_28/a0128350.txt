This three-year award supports U.S.-France collaboration in
              astronomy between William F. Bottke of the Southwest Research Institute and
              Alessandro Morbidelli of the Observatory of Nice.  The project addresses the
              origin and evolution of near earth objects or NEOs, a population of asteroids
              and comets crossing or nearly crossing the Earth's orbit. Present knowledge of
              orbital and size distributions of the NEO population is limited, because the
              NEOs known to the Earth are biased by complicated observational selection
              effects and because only a modest fraction of the entire NEO population has
              been discovered. US and French researchers addressed the first problem through
              development of quantitative models of debiased orbital and absolute magnitude
              distribution of NEOs.  This collaboration is extended to new problems: design
              of NEO surveys to determine how and where to find the most hazardous or hard to
              find NEOs; computation of frequency of impacts on Earth and other terrestrial
              bodies as a function of the impact energy; computation of the relative
              collision rate on the moon and terrestrial planets; and computation of the
              upper limits on long-period and Halley-type comet population.  The French
              investigators bring to this collaboration expertise in asteroid and cometary
              dynamics and the physics of collision fragmentation.  This is complemented by
              US expertise in fast integration codes; large scale numerical simulations and
              statistics on orbital evolution.
