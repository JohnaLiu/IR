Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will develop novel
              trimetallic nitride template endohedral fullerene (TNTs) materials for use as
              contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). TNTs, which offer
              significant diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities, are now available in
              sufficient research quantities. Chemical functionalization reactions to
              solubilize the TNTs are also now available. TNTs offer an exciting alternative
              to current MRI contrast agents. TNTs offer the flexibility of excapsulating a
              variety of paramagnetic metals into the C80 fullerene cage. As several of the
              metals are paramagnetic, a production optimization plan balancing cost of
              materials versus efficiency as an MRI contrast agent is a primary focus of this
              project. The development of TNT based contrast agents is expected to lead to
              smaller patient doses, increased T1 relaxation rates and increased product
              safety.

The commercial application of this project is in the contrast agent
              segment of the MRI imaging market. If successful, this project could result in
              a significant expansion in MRI capability and usage, with the potential of
              developing new business on the order of $700 million per year.
