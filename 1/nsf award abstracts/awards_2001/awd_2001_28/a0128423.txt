This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project
              will test the feasibility of a new production technology for affordable
              near-net shape components of a class of advanced refractory metal intermetallic
              composites.  Niobium (Nb)-based intermetallics will permit a revolutionary
              increase in operating temperatures for many very high temperature applications.
              Phase I will employ an innovative reactive metal investment casting method to
              create a cost-effective and robust process for manufacturing complex shapes.
              Phase II would explore strategies for producing actual
              components.

Anticipated commercial applications are those at very high
              temperatures, such as turbine airfoils now made of single crystal nickel-based
              superalloys.  Unprecedented levels of fuel efficiency and thrust-to-weight
              ratio are expected for future aircraft systems.
