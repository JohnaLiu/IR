Paytan

This U.S.-Mexico award will support Dr. Adina Paytan of
              Stanford University in a research collaboration with Dr. Jorge A.
              Herrera-Silveira of Cinvestav-Merida in Yucatan, Mexico.  The researchers
              intend to work on a multiple-year study to gain a better understanding of the
              mechanisms underlying methane production and oxidation in mangrove ecosystems. 
              They aim to obtain reliable estimates of methane flux from mangrove ecosystems
              to the atmosphere, and predict fluctuations in this flux that may result from
              climatic and anthropogenic change.  The Office of International Science and
              Engineering and the Division of Environmental Biology of NSF will contribute
              funds for the research.

The study will take place in several lagoons
              dominated by mangrove vegetation located on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.
              These lagoons have similar vegetation and climate patterns yet very different
              levels of freshwater and nutrient inputs and anthropogenic impact, allowing for
              comparison of various parameters in the study. Project results will allow
              better estimates to be made of the contribution of worldwide mangrove
              ecosystems to the global methane budget and predict potential changes in this
              flux. The collaborators will bring complementary skills to the project with Dr.
              Herrera-Silveira emphasizing biological aspects and Dr. Paytan focusing on
              biogeochemical interactions in the ecosystem.
