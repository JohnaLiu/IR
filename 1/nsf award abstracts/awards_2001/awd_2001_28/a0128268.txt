Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project will
              demonstrate the capability of a universal solvent set concept to reduce the
              environmental and health impact of solvents used in the construction of fuel
              cells and printed wiring boards, without significantly increasing cost or
              reducing performance. The key objectives involve (1) development of solubility
              maps for mixtures of solvents using only the solvents and solvent mixtures
              contained in the proposed universal solvent set (2) Formulation of trial
              precursor solutions derived from the solubility maps (3) Screening of the trial
              formulations for desirable characteristics (thermal stability, ease of
              atomization, shelf life, low nozzle buildup) (4) Performance of trial thin film
              depositions to produce sample fuel cell catalyst membranes and resistor
              materials for printed wiring boards and (5) customer evaluation of fuel cell
              and resistor material samples.

The proposed work will facilitate creation of
              environmentally friendly precursor solutions that will have impact in the fuel
              cells and embedded passives industry and, in particular in the combustion
              chemical vapor deposition process which is enabling next generation products in
              electronics, advanced energy, and broadband.
