Abstract    :
              The Exploratorium is testing new methods of using Internet-based programming to
              increase the public understanding of current scientific research. 
              Exploratorium staff, working with a group of advisors, will assess the current
              status of projects that focus on conveying information about research.  They
              then will develop and test a prototype website.  The exploratory research will
              examine such questions as:  What information about research is important and
              critical to convey to the public? How do you build a Web presence that can
              rapidly accommodate new findings? What is an appropriate oversight process to
              assure inclusion of appropriate research? What are sufficient update
              intervals? How does such a Web site build an audience? How can the Web effort
              be coordinated with other PUR projects? How can the Web site provide
              opportunities for public input and discussion? How do you develop buy-in and
              participation from researchers? Is the additional interpretation/annotation
              sufficient to give the public a deeper level of understanding?  These
              planning and prototyping efforts will be coordinated with other simultaneous
              Public Understanding of Research planning projects.
