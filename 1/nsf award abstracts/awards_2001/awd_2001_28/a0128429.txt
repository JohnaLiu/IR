Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to
              develop a real time
coating property sensor to measure intrinsic material
              properties of thermal spray coatings.  The project proposes to develop this
              technology into a production capable tool for thermal spray process development
              and control with the following attributes: measures useful coating properties
              in situ; usable by real world spray shop operators at both small and large
              shops; relatively inexpensive (<$25K); able to operate in harsh environment;
              and uses minimal assumptions and complexities associated with property
              interpretation.  The project will demonstrate feasibility of producing such a
              tool under Phase I.  Under Phase II, a production tool will be developed and
              important relationships between the tool output and the functional properties
              of the coatings will be generated.  Despite this need, there are no simple
              procedures currently available to rapidly determine the mechanical properties
              of coatings both in laboratory and industrial settings. As thermal spray
              coatings evolve from a role of life extension of components to performing a
              prime reliant function, there exists a critical need to develop procedures to
              obtain design relevant properties.

The impact of this project will provide
              commercial thermal spray customers with engineering support directed at
              improving quality and repeatability of coatings application.  This should
              result in significant capital expenditure savings for companies over many
              disciplines that are involved in manufacturing.
