Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish
              the feasibility of a materials system to encase customized ceramic signage (and
              other lightscaping products) which utilize solid-state ceramic lamps as a
              backlight source. These systems should achieve extraordinary power efficiency
              by illuminating the information rather than the entire sign area and are
              intended for external operation over a
wide environmental range (e.g. extremes
              in temperature, humidity, acid rain, etc). The proposed encasement method uses
              special materials formulations applied through ultrasonic spray and CNC
              technologies to create custom ceramic surfaces. These surfaces display the
              information content in a backlit format while protecting the light emitting
              ceramic layer from the external operating environment.

This system provides
              a semi-transparent, multi-colored outer ceramic layer exhibiting a combination
              of information display and artistic presentation features when backlit by a
              solid-state ceramic lamp. This technology can be applied to a wide variety of
              commercial signage and lightscaping applications.
