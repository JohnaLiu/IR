Raines
This award supports Ronald Raines and students from the
              University of Wisconsin-Madison in a collaboration with Renate Ulbrich-Hofmann
              of the Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology at the University of
              Leipzig, Germany.  The aim of the international project is to use
              intein-mediated protein ligation to create semisynthetic variants of
              ribonuclease A.  These variants will be produced by the US group and studied
              with respect to their thermodynamic and proteolytic stability by methods
              established in the German group.  The results will provide new insight into
              protein-folding pathways and the fundamental basis for protein stability, and
              ultimately lead to the creation of new proteins with desirable properties.  The
              work plan provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the
              international travel and research.
