Abstract    :
              Natural ecosystems are dynamic, not static. For instance, plants themselves
              alter properties of soils and ecosystems. Thus, the characteristics of
              different plant species influence important ecosystem functions such as soil
              fertility, soil development and plant productivity, and thus in part control
              ecosystem functioning. The specifics of these controls, however, are very
              poorly understood due to difficulties in separating effects of climate or soils
              from those of vegetation. To explore the way in which plants can influence
              their own environment, we will utilize a unique common-garden experiment of
              32-year old monoculture stands with 14 temperate tree species in Poland. This
              is the only such experiment in the world. The proposed research will compare
              and contrast leaf and fine root traits and their effects on ecosystem by
              examining: above- and belowground tissue physiology, structure and
              productivity, litter decomposition and soil chemistry and development.
