Abstract    :
                  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result
              in manufacturing processes for low-cost, multi-functional composite materials
              that have marine, rail and other ground transportation safety applications. The
              key steps will involve (1) development of innovative manufacturing methods
              using out-of-autoclave processes, that are derivatives of liquid molding
              approaches, to co-infuse resin systems in multi-layered composites of simple
              shapes representative of structures and (2) production of a number of fiber
              ply/metal foam combinations and measurement of  mechanical and physical
              properties of these combinations to assess potential improvements in structural
              performance such as damage tolerance and high fatigue life. 
     Existing
              materials designed to protect against flying debris or provide impact
              protection in vehicles tend to be heavy and to be appendages on structural
              systems. The new materials produced here, which consist of a metal foam
              surrounded by facing plies of resin-infused glass, carbon, or aramid fibers,
              will be designed to integrate affordability and functionality. Improved
              properties will lead to new markets with a focus on enhanced passenger
              protection in aviation, marine, and ground vehicles.
