Abstract    :
              synthesis of these major approaches.  Second, it is the intent to develop a
              research methodology that can be adapted for classroom use. Recent work by
              Li-Ping Ma has called attention to the ideas of depth and connectivity of
              mathematical knowledge. The PI hopes to develop a blend of qualitative and
              quantitative methods that can be used to analyze the depth and connectivity of
              a student's mathematical knowledge. With the current affordability of powerful
              computers, there has been a new push to use computer analysis to gain insight
              into qualitative data. Existing software like Sacks Conversation Map and
              Krackplot of social network theorists will be evaluated for use in the math
              education setting, and new software will be developed as necessary.  Third,
              the research results will be disseminated not only using the traditional
              avenues of conferences and published papers, but also over the Internet in a
              web-searchable database. The PI has considerable experience in such projects
              and already runs two such servers: one is a database of educational resources
              for the national community of Treisman workshop leaders and another one holds
              for math and statistics education papers for the Special Interest Group on
              Undergraduate Math Education of the MAA. Among the indexed and posted contents
              will be classroom instruments along with examples of student work.  As a
              final benefit, student research assistants will play important roles in the
              research, either graduate students or motivated advanced undergraduates. The
              experience will be designed to cultivate an interest in math education in the
              math majors chosen to work on the project, with an eye towards encouraging them
              to pursue careers in math teaching or math education research.
