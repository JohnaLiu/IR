Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will study the
              feasibility of building a reliable, high-performance network-centric storage
              system technology (NetSTOR). NetSTOR's architecture is based on a new very fast
              group data coding (GC) scheme that will achieve efficient and dependable data
              delivery across the network. Recently, the need for network storage has
              burgeoned, without truly universal solutions being available. Phase I will
              evaluate the performance improvement achieved by NetSTOR's unique architecture
              and validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the GC technique. Efficient
              decoding algorithms will be employed to achieve reliability against server
              failure and faulty network connections. Multi-threaded parallel data transfer
              will ensure high performance data delivery. Automatic system reconfigurability
              will provide high data availability. The system will be application-aware
              addressing application specific issues such as cache management, data layout,
              and prefetching will be employed for performance optimization.

Potential
              commercial applications of the proposed storage system include distributed web
              hosting, multi media network-based services, high performance computing,
              modeling and simulation, distributed information retrieval, and terrain
              visualization. Applications of group coding in areas other than data storage
              include mobile communication, reliable multicasting, audio/video streaming, and
              digital fountain systems will be considered.
