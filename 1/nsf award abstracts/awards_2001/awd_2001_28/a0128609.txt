Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine
              the feasibility of designing the scanning electron microscope (SEM) component
              of an instrument simulator.  Cost prohibits that incorporation of a variety of
              image/composition-based instruments used in research and industry into relevant
              modern science/math/ engineering/technology curricula.  Some of these
              instruments are becoming available over the Internet, but they provide limited
              access to students and, in general, they are not fully functional.  The
              research objectives in Phase I to will primarily relate to the method(s) of
              manipulating a very large image (the equivalent of over 1000 SEM images) in a
              manner that faithfully simulates the operation of a real WEB-based SEM.  The
              key research area will be to develop an image-management and input/output
              engine.  The anticipated deliverable of Phase I is the SEM image simulator, and
              the outline of several educational modules on CD/DVD media.
 
Instrument
              simulation proffered by the RJ Lee Group has the potential to distribute the
              benefits of the resource of a variety of image/composition-based instruments
              (via CD or DVD) to all students in a class throughout a school year.  A
              simplified viewer mode would be developed for the informal education and home
              markets, and an advanced mode incorporating specific science content
              interactive discovery-based modules would be developed for the K-college formal
              education market.
