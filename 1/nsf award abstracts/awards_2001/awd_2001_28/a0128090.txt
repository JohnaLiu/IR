Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop:
              connections between concrete-filled fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) tubes
              (splicing and joints) and with other traditional construction materials; a
              cost-effective structural framing system; and design aids and specifications
              for these structural framing systems.  The advantages of concrete-filled FRP
              tubes (CFFT) over concrete-filled steel tubes (CFST) include high
              strength-to-weight ratio, durability, and the possibility of optimizing and
              engineering the fiber orientation for best result.  Experiments have shown that
              CFFTs can significantly increase strength and ductility of normal strength
              concrete (3-5  thousand pounds per square inch (ksi) and 0.003-0.004 ultimate
              strain) to the level of high-performance concrete (15-20 ksi and 0.02-0.04
              ultimate strain).   Phase I will develop both analytical and experimental
              components, conduct modeling, calibration, and parametric studies, and perform
              limited proof-of-concept testing.  Phase II would concentrate on manufacturing
              these new system components.

The new framing system utilizing CFFTs and
              other structural forms are expected to be used in civil construction such as
              buildings and bridges.  It will offer superior seismic performance and higher
              resistance to explosion damage, such as in terrorist attacks, in comparison
              with traditional systems. In addition, long durability and corrosion resistance
              are expected to extend the designed life span of many civil structures with low
              maintenance costs.
