This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in
              condensed matter physics theory involves students and faculty researchers at
              Boston University, Ecole Normale Superieure, Ecole Superieure de Physique et
              Chimie, and Commission de l'Energie Atomique in Paris, France.  Claudio Chamon
              and Leticia Cugliandolo from Boston and Paris respectively will lead the
              collaborative program.  The theoretical work involves studies of quantum
              non-equilibrium dynamics in both driven and non-driven systems.  The research
              focuses on aging dynamics, infinite dimensional quantum spin glass systems,
              aging and memory effects in electronic glasses, and noise, quantum
              fluctuations, charge, spin in quantum wires, quantum dots, and carbon nanotubes
              . The collaboration takes advantage of complementary French expertise in
              quantum systems, spin glass models, and dynamics in electronic glasses.

              
This award represents the US side of joint proposals to the NSF and the
              French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel
              funds and living expenses of the US investigators and graduate students.  The
              CNRS will support visits to US of the French participants. The collaboration
              will advance understanding of quantum systems and computational and theoretical
              methods.  The theoretical results will be applied to experimental data and lead
              to new interdisciplinary research directions in statistical mechanics and
              quantum condensed matter physics.
