Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              new approach to economical, ultra high performance coating composites. This
              approach is based on the use of  alumoxane nanoparticles. These functional
              inorganic-organic nanoparticles improve physical properties such as toughness,
              impermeability, chemical resistance and flexibility. This novel approach to
              production will demonstrate a highly cost effective manufacturing methodology
              that can be easily carried out in the coating plant, wherein the nanoparticle
              production becomes an integral part of the coating manufacturing process. The
              project will seek an understanding of the mechanisms that influence the top
              down fragmenting phenomenon. Nanoparticles, in slurry form, will be
              functionalized and then incorporated into the high performance coating.

The
              commercial applications of this project will have a broad and significant
              impact in the nation's 1.7 billion dollar industrial coatings market. This
              market  includes interior linings, chemical resistant coatings and rail car
              linings.
