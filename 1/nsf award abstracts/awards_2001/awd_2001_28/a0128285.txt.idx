Abstract    :
                   The investigator organizes an international conference at Institut des
              Hautes Etudes Scientifiques to study folding and self-assembly of
              macromolecules.  Self-organization of macromolecules is a fundamental question
              in molecular biology. How molecules fold plays a major role in their
              organization.  The meeting fosters the creation of new tools by bringing
              together scientists from several domains to consider the problem
              from different perspectives.      DNA is like a long zipper whose teeth are
              pairs of molecules, called base pairs, one molecule on each side of
              the zipper.  Links between the base pairs close the zipper.  The zipper is
              about six feet long in human DNA; to fit inside a cell, it coils up.  It
              partially uncoils to expose sections --- genes --- that are read to produce an
              intermediate molecule, called messenger RNA.  Ribosomes read the messenger RNA
              and produce a corresponding amino acid chain.  The chain folds up
              spontaneously; this is a protein.  Proteins in turn perform their functions
              by partially unfolding to interact with other folded
              macromolecules. Proteins, genes, and DNA all fold and unfold to do their work.
               So folding and self-assembly are central issues in molecular biology.  A
              goal of the conference is to stimulate synergistic interchanges between
              different disciplines by bringing together biologists, chemists, physicists,
              mathematicians, and computer scientists to discuss these issues from different
              perspectives.
