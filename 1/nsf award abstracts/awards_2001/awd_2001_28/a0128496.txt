Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              the correlation between  bound-water dielectric relaxation observed by
              broadband permittivity measurement and the degree of hydration in Portland
              cement, and apply the results to the refinement of a concrete cure monitoring
              system under development at the company. Complex permittivity over the
              frequency range 10 kHz to 10 GHz in curing cement shows signal components due
              to 1) free-water behavior near 10 GHz which decreases during cure and follows
              percent hydration, and 2) bound-water behavior between 1-1000 MHz which
              increases during early hours of cure and decreases and broadens thereafter. The
              bound-water relaxation does not appear in the initial cement paste but does
              appear after several hours of cure, mirroring the formation of hydration
              products to which it is attaching. This behavior will be elucidated by varying
              initial chemistry and determining effects on signal, quantifying changes in
              relaxation frequency and amplitude with cure time and fitting to appropriate
              models. 

The commercial potential of this project is in the construction
              industry.
