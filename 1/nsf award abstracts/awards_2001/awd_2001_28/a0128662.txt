Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus
              on development of  unique ceramic/polyimide nanocomposite materials. It will
              demonstrate the ability to formulate a polyimide (or other polymer material)
              with a designed coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)  through the covalent
              incorporation of ceramic nanophase materials. The key tasks involve (1) sol-gel
              synthesis of ceramic nanospheres possessing a negative CTE (2) covalently
              bonding them into the backbone of the
polyimide through the use of
              bi-functional linker molecules and (3) evaluation of various doping levels of
              the ceramic nanospheres to determine optimum impact on the CTE of the composite
              material. 
     In terms of commercial uses, polyimides have wide application
              as films in
the electronics, aerospace, and manufacturing industries where
              they are used for flexible
circuitry, insulation materials, speaker cones,
              automotive switches, disk drives, and in
many other applications. A common
              problem in the design of these systems using polyimides is the inherently high
              CTE of these materials and to a certain extent poor  thermal dimensional
              stability. The proposed effort seeks to provide an approach to resolve these
              issues.
