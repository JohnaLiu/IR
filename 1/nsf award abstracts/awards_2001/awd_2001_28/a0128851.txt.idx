Abstract    :
                0128851 McKoy  This Americas Program award will support Dr. Vincent McKoy
              of the California Institute of Technology in collaboration with Dr. Marco A.
              Lima of the Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Brazil and Dr. Marcio H. Bettega
              of the Universidade Federal do Parana, Brazil.  The aim of the project is to
              determine why the differential elastic cross sections obtained from high-level
              calculations using a number of methods exhibit, within certain ranges of
              collision energy and scattering angle, surprisingly large deviations from
              recent experiments.    The calculations will produce very valuable data,
              adding significantly to the knowledge of electron scattering from a handful of
              technologically and fundamentally important molecules.  The project also
              promotes education and training by providing an opportunity for Brazilian
              graduate students in the physical sciences to gain experience with the
              application of large-scale parallel computation to scientific problems.
