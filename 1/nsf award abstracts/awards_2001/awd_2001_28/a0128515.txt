Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address one
              of the major obstacles to commercial development of broadband fixed wireless
              access under 5 GHz, namely overcoming a "convergence bottleneck" arising from
              distance-sensitive propagation conditions. It is well known that as distance
              ranges from line of sight to well beyond line of sight, transmission parameters
              can degrade dramatically. However, current state-of-the-art treats this
              condition in a highly unsatisfactory way, through statistical models, through
              "handshake" schemes, modulation fallback, use of preambles and embedded pilot
              tones, to name just a few. An innovative concept will be demonstrated for
              rapid, two-way, unobtrusive and easily scaled RF measurements that permit
              characterizing thousands of hub-to-subscriber paths precisely without
              guesswork. Regional operations centers, hub base station and consumer terminals
              will operate more efficiently due to the network's ability to converge rapidly
              on near-optimum transmission characteristics. 

This innovation will make
              broadband more readily available to populations that live and work where DSL,
              fiber, and cable modem service is not offered. This includes: people who work
              in outdoor locations, in hard-to-get-to schools, libraries, college campuses,
              transportation systems, factories, waterways, and small businesses.
