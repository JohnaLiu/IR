Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will use a
              moisture sensor to monitor moisture ingress, corrosion, and delamination of
              fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) concrete structures.  Phase I will build on the
              development of a moisture sensor for composite aircraft and adapt its use for
              infrastructure such as bridges.  FRP is increasingly being used to reinforce
              such structures during rehabilitation, but uncertainties concerning the health
              of the composite and the bond between the composite and the concrete prevent
              widespread application.  The moisture sensor, which is based on the established
              technique of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), will allow moisture
              intrusion and the effects of moisture to be tracked from very early stages.
              

Initial commercial applications will involve an inspector using a portable
              computer to interrogate the sensors to determine structural health.  The
              advanced application would include a permanently mounted potentiostat module
              that would periodically send signals to a central location.  Commercial
              opportunities include over100,000 structurally deficient bridges that are
              candidates for FRP rehabilitation.
