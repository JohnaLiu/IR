Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves
              development of fully inorganic nanofiltration (NF) membrane modules that
              combine the attributes of low cost, excellent chemical resistance in aggressive
              organic and aqueous media, high thermal stability, and high mechanical
              strength.  The key objectives  will be to develop  NF membrane modules based on
              low-cost multi-channel honeycomb supports with 220 square cetimeter membrane
              area and to demonstrate they have NF retention capability, high productivity
              (flux rates), and resistance to aggressive organic and aqueous media. 
              Preliminary work to fabricate analogous modules with 1200 square centimeter
              membrane area will be performed. 

The modules, when ultimately
              commercialized to very large size, will be especially suitable for in-process
              recycling of solvents used in a wide variety of applications and could replace
              distillation as a cost-effective purification method for solvents such as
              hexane and acetone that are used in very large quantities in edible oil
              processing. In addition, the products would have wide application in the
              chemical manufacturing, petrochemical, petroleum production, pharmaceutical,
              food processing, and water treatment industries.
