Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will catalyze the
              creation of interactive worlds accessible over the Internet where students,
              professionals, and consumers can experientially learn scientific concepts not
              readily accessible to human physical interaction.  The specific focus is the
              construction of a cellular world where University students can explore complex
              cellular mechanisms, and through customized versions, corporations can educate
              physicians, researchers and patients on the cellular basis of their products. 
              As a proof of concept, Voyager Interactive has created a demonstration of 3D
              content delivered over the Internet using narrowband connectivity. This
              demostration allows students to become" a virus particle and if successful,
              infect a cell.  The student moves within a 3D cellular world, activates viral
              functions, interacts with objects, and triggers events in the world.  A Cellbot
              companion interacts by voice and by uploading text and figures to assist the
              student.  The content and functionality requirements described in the proposal
              will be translated into a comprehensive software development plan, which will
              serve as the blueprint for success in the phase of the research.

The
              BioMachine Cellular World proffers a significant contribution to science
              education and an excellent launch point for custom commercial collaborations. 
              It has prospects for science publishers interested in immersive 3D cellular
              educational software for use by electronic texts as well as indirect benefits
              associated with the identification of functional requirements for promoting
              student active learning in these highly interactive environments.
