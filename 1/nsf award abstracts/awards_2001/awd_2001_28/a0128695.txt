Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on the
              development of a commercially viable continuous process for bioethanol
              recovery.  The proposed process will integrate a novel permeate condensation
              approach with the energy-efficient pervaporation technology. Due to increased
              interest in renewable fuels, domestic use of bioethanol is expected to grow
              steadily over the next decade. The primary processing steps, fermentation and
              ethanol recovery and purification are a significant component of the total cost
              of bioethanol production. Process improvements, such as incorporation of
              continuous fermentation and development of energy-efficient ethanol recovery
              technologies would reduce the production cost significantly. 

Successful
              completion of the project objective will lead to a reduction in the sizes of
              the fermentor and elimination of the distillation step, and consequently reduce
              the cost and enhance the energy efficiency of
the entire bioethanol production
              process. The primary customers of the proposed technology will be the ethanol
              producers, but the technology has potential applications in the recovery of
              other fermentation-derived organic solvents as well.
