Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the
              feasibility of a computerized projection system to be used in planetariums in
              the nation's schools.  With such a digital projector, a simulated night sky can
              be imaged with the capacity for a multitude of motions and displays surpassing
              all but the most sophisticated of museum planetariums.  When coupled with
              suitable simulation software, information-based technology can be used to
              encourage interactive and inquiry-based activities.  In addition, the
              planetarium projector will have capabilities shared by no other; that is, being
              able to project dynamically changing information displays of the earth,
              including plate tectonics, weather patterns, and biological
              distributions.

The system proffered will help promote interdisciplinary
              studies, use the latest astronomical and GIS data, and aid in teaching the
              content of the national standards, especially earth science at the elementary
              and middle school level.
