Abstract    :
              The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
              synthesis of new polysiloxane-polyimide co-polymers for use as high-temperature
              resistant polymeric matrix materials.  Phase I will develop new highly usable
              synthetic methodologies for the production of inorganic-organic hybrid
              materials composed of cross-linked polysiloxane-polyimide segments.  The
              cross-linking or curing (hydrosilylation) reaction may be conducted at room
              temperature, thus providing the opportunity to develop a non-autoclave or
              low-temperature curing system, similar to the well-established room temperature
              vulcanization process widely used in the silicone industry.  The expected
              high-performance polymeric materials would be employed in Phase II as matrix
              materials for low-temperature fabrication of polymeric matrix composites (PMC).
               In Phase II polymer formulation will be optimized, and distinctive PMC
              components will be fabricated by employing proprietary low-cost resin transfer
              molding technologies.

Commercial applications are expected in
              low-temperature curable/high-temperature resistant cure-in-place materials. 
              Potential fields of application include automotive components, aeronautics,
              microelectronics, composites, construction materials, and other industries
              where outstanding thermal, chemical (solvents and oxidation resistance),
              physical, and mechanical properties are important.
