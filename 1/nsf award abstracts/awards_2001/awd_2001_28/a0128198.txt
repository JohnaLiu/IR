Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop as
              well as establish technical and commercial feasibility of the advanced low
              weight thermal and electrical insulation materials using fullerenes. This
              approach combines high reflectivity of metal foil and high absorptivity of low
              thermal conductivity fullerenes in attempt to produce effective structurally
              integrated low cost insulation material, which is expected to be much thinner
              than any other option currently available on the market. During the course of
              investigation, the proposed insulation materials will be fabricated and fully
              characterized in terms of density, thermal conductivity as well mechanical
              integrity and compared with other candidate materials. The approach should
              provide viable solutions to various heat management problems in numerous
              fields.
     If proved viable, this insulation will find extensive
              applications in rockets and satellites, cryogenic industry, electronic devices,
              fire-retardant packing materials, thermal insulators for temperature-sensitive
              products, insulative clothing, insulation of buildings, cars, refrigerators,
              water heaters, etc.
