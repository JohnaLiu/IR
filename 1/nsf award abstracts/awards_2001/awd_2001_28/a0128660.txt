Abstract    :
              
 This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project investigates the
              opportunities inherent in long-distance learning alternatives fashioned around
              the telnet internet protocol.  To date, virtually all long-distance learning
              trials have been designed to operate using the procedures of the world-wide web
              (HTTP, CGI, Java, etc.), but these web-based solutions have a number of obvious
              intrinsic problems.  Such solutions tend to be quite slow, and they are capable
              of only moderate interactivity, often quite fragile, and rapidly become
              surprisingly complex.  In contrast, the telnet protocol, when used with a more
              or less standard terminal emulator, tends to be very responsive over the
              internet, especially when the protocol is very slightly modified, and very
              simple to program against.  The creation of a freely distributed player and
              accompanying inexpensive authoring tool built around a standard terminal
              interface could be of importance to areas with underdeveloped communications
              infrastructures, thus making the internet accessible to those who can afford
              only low-bandwidth internet.  
 The distributed player and authoring tool
              proffered by Aics Inc has the potential to have an important impact on the
              nature and methods of the distribution of information opportunities for
              secondary education through graduate and continuing professional education, and
              they could serve in technical commercial sales and training and in more
              generally in crossing the digital divide.
