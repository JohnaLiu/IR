Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              new methodology to manage the inventory of service parts used to provide
              after-sales support of mission-critical products. In particular this research
              will develop computationally efficient and optimal algorithms for replenishment
              and allocation of inventory in service parts logistics networks. Subsequently,
              the algorithms will be incorporated into a commercial software product platform
              for service supply chain optimization. Service part optimization requires
              specialized models, since demand (due to machine failures and unscheduled
              maintenance) is infrequent and difficult to predict. Movement of parts must be
              coordinated across many inter-connected stocking locations in order to
              facilitate on- time delivery, often within hours or even minutes. In addition,
              there are multiple sources of supply for these parts such as internal
              manufacturing, external suppliers, repair vendors, and de-manufacturing.
              

Current commercial service supply chain optimization systems do not
              incorporate these complexities of the service supply chains. As a consequence,
              they perform poorly in after-sales service environments resulting in extensive
              in service parts inventory that turns only 1 to 2 times per year. This research
              can lead to commercial technology that can reduce this expense
              substantially.
