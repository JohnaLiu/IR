Explaining the widespread distribution and maintenance of
              genetic recombination is widely regarded as one of the most interesting
              challenges facing evolutionary biologists, and a large number of ecological and
              genetical hypotheses have been suggested to explain why clonal reproduction has
              not generally replaced genetically recombining individuals in populations.
              Contrasting these alternatives has proven difficult, but the effort is greatly
              aided by studies of populations in which clonal and recombinant individuals
              coexist. Such mixed populations are common in the freshwater New Zealand snail,
              Potamopyrgus antipodarum, which has been used as a model system for evaluating
              different hypotheses. In past studies, no support for the lottery hypothesis,
              the reproductive assurance hypothesis, or the tangled bank hypothesis has been
              found. In contrast, past work has shown that the frequency of recombinant
              individuals is spatially coupled with the prevalence of infection by larval
              trematodes. This result is consistent with the idea that time-lagged,
              frequency-dependent selection by parasites prevents the elimination of
              recombinant hosts by clonal hosts - the Red Queen hypothesis. But, direct tests
              of this hypothesis are still needed. This LTREB research will allow measurement
              in mixed populations of the frequency of recombinant and clonal individuals
              over time. Long-term data will provide a test of the hypothesis that
              time-lagged selection by parasites prevents the replacement of recombinant
              individuals by clonal individuals in natural populations.
