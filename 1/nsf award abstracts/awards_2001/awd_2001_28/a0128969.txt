This award supports Robert Boltje and students from the
              University of California-Santa Cruz in a collaboration with Burkhard Kulshammer
              of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Jena, Germany.  The aim
              of the international project is to study the structure of various
              representation rings of finite groups, viz., the ring of monomial
              representations, the trivial and linear source ring, the Green ring, and other
              viariants.  The results are expected to have applications to generalizations of
              Brown's theorem on Euler characteristics and to invariants in algebraic number
              theory, and might also uncover connections to algebraic topology.  The work
              plan provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the
              international travel and research, and the exchange is intendedto let them
              benefit from the complementary strengths of both collaborators and to introduce
              them at an early stage to international collaboration to stimulate further
              exchange of ideas.
