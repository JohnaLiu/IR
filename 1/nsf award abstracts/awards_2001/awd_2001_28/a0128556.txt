Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the
              problem of short-term hospital census prediction.  Fluctuating occupancy can
              impact many operational metrics: direct staffing costs, emergency center
              ambulance diversions, medical errors triggered in understaffed patient areas,
              quality of care, and job satisfaction for the dwindling nursing pool.  This
              project will result in a computer based decision support system for predicting
              short-term patient occupancy at a nursing unit level over 72-hour time
              horizons. The short-term forecasts will be tested in a 226-bed community
              hospital.  The first objective is to quantify sources of error in an
              alpha-version of the model and to develop an improved model.  The objective is
              to prove that the improved model generates accurate predictions of patient
              census.  Next, the research will quantify the potential impact of short-term
              forecasts on nurse staffing and scheduling.  Surveys with hospital personnel
              will gauge the interest in and utility of the forecast information.  The
              national shortage of nurses demands better use of this limited
              resource.

Improvement Path Systems' objective is to build commercial
              forecasting software to be licensed to hospitals.  The daily forecasts of
              hospital occupancy will allow hospitals to make better staffing decisions and
              operate more efficiently.  The proposed decision support system can be
              generalized to other dynamic systems involving people flows.
