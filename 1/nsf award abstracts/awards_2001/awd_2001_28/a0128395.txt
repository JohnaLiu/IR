Abstract    :
              
     This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project seeks to develop
              a meshless Petrov-Galerkin geo-environ technology for wide scale field uses. 
              Groundwater supplies are increasingly threatened by organic, inorganic, and
              radioactive contaminants introduced to the environment by improper disposal or
              accidental releases.  Estimates of remediation costs at U.S. government sites
              alone range into the billions of dollars.  Geo-environ assessment tools play an
              important role in design and evaluations of remediation alternatives and
              long-term management of groundwater.  Proposed mesh free geo-environ technology
              will open a new era for easy simulation of large complex systems without grid
              generation.  Node density will adjust dynamically for accurate solution.  A
              Petrov-Galerkin based model will provide stable robust technology for
              contaminant transport and remediation alternative evaluations.  Interfaced 2D
              and 3D displays and animations will provide efficient means for easy
              communications within project team, decision-makers, and regulators.
    
              Consultants for Environmental System Technologies' proposed technology has
              applicability to numerous waste site restoration programs and groundwater
              management projects that are implemented at an enormous cost by Federal
              agencies, states, counties, petroleum facilities and chemical industries.
