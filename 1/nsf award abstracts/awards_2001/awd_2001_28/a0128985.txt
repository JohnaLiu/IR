Abstract    :
              EarthTalk Incorporated is producing and distributing 282 "Edge of Discovery"
              radio programs.  Each of the 90-second programs will explore an area of
              on-going research and will feature "actualities" or recorded voices of
              scientists explaining their work.  The programs will be carried on 700+ public
              and commercial radio stations.  The broadcast programs will be supplemented by
              an "Edge of Discovery" web presence that will contain the radio programs
              themselves plus a "More Info" section for each program that includes references
              to printed articles and links to other web sites on the day's topic as well as
              supplementary background material such as transcripts of interviews with
              scientists.  The "Edge of Discovery" web page also will feature a "Meet the
              Scientists" section in which a new scientist will be profiled each month, and
              it will feature live online "chats" with scientists six times each year.

The
              producers/hosts for the series are Deborah Byrd and Joel Block who created,
              produced and hosted the highly successful radio series Earth and Sky.  The
              Senior Producer is Marc Airhart who will be primary liaison with the team of
              researchers and writers.  Review of all material developed for the projected
              will be done by the project's review committee of 95 scientists.
