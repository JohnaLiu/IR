Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project concerns R&D
              aimed at assessing the feasibility of applying statistical Machine Translation
              (MT) techniques to the problem of improving the productivity of human
              translators. Currently, human translators use translation memory tools, i.e.,
              software packages that provide access to databases of previously translated
              sentences. Unfortunately, these tools do not provide significant help in
              translating previously unseen sentences and do not improve over time (with the
              exception of providing access to increasingly larger databases of previously
              translated material). Because automatic translation systems produce low quality
              translations that are not tailored to their genre and domain of interest, human
              translators refuse to use automatic translation systems. In this program, a
              prototype hybrid translation system and computer interface that will permit
              humans to translate text by exploiting both a translation memory and an
              automatic, statistical-based MT system will be built and 
the increase in text
              translation productivity that is enabled by the use of the hybrid tool will be
              measured.

A hybrid translation tool such as that proposed here has the
              potential to reduce significantly the costs associated with human translation,
              and increase translation productivity.
