This award supports the participation of American scientists
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on new aspects of quark nuclear physics with polarized
              photons to be held in Honolulu, Hawaii from February 25-28, 2003.  The
              co-organizers are Professor Kenneth Hicks at Ohio University and Professor
              Hajime Shimizu of Yamagata University in Japan.  The workshop will provide a
              forum for presentations and discussions of the structure of subatomic particles
              using new results from experiments with polarized photons incident on polarized
              hydrogen and deuterium.  Both theoretical and experimental techniques will be
              discussed, with the objective to gain a better interpretation of the data. 
              

Plans for new cooperative activities resulting from the workshop will most
              likely be in the form of new proposals for experiments at the new facilities. 
              These collaborations would be a natural result of sharing experimental
              techniques for polarized targets and beams.  In addition, theoretical input
              from experts across the globe will be highly desirable to provide an overview
              of the role of non-perturbative QCD in the interpretation of precise
              polarization observables to be presented at the workshop.  The project advances
              international human resources through the participation of many junior faculty,
              postdocs and graduate students. Through the exchange of ideas and technology,
              this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international
              understanding and cooperation. The researchers plan to publish proceedings of
              the workshop through either the World Scientific Publishing Company or through
              the Jefferson Laboratory.
