Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the
              widespread need to improve the productivity of the student learning process in
              a wide variety of public, private and commercial environments. Using the
              Internet. speaktomi, LLC. has conceived, developed, and, demonstrated an
              innovation: a natural language query system (NLQS). This system is an
              Internet-based intelligent query system that combines distributed speech
              recognition and natural language understanding technologies. Speaktomi
              demonstrated and tested a NLQS prototype system using English in 2000 and
              Japanese in May 2001. The core technology of speaktomi's NLQS is a set of
              proprietary software components, integrated by speaktomi, LLC., using
              speaktomi's architectures and approaches (patents applied for) which support
              several languages and require no speaker training. The objectives of this
              research are to advance the performance of the NLQS system to the point of
              being able to define the specifications for a commercial product embodying
              NLQS. Specifically we will improve the system accuracy, latency, port the
              system to a PDA and identify client-server bottlenecks.
     The applications
              span learning grades K3-16 and above, in a broad array of commercial and
              military training programs, and when in combination with a translation engine,
              the NLQS technology can form a basis for systems that support interactive
              queries and real time collaboration across several languages.
