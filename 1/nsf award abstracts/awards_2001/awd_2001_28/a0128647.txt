Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will determine the
              technical feasibility for applying a new innovative sensing technology to
              rapidly identify and sort aluminum metals from other non-magnetic metals such
              as copper, zinc, nickel, and non-magnetic stainless steels commonly found in
              scrap metals, particularly metals derived from automobile shredder facilities.
              The objective will be to develop an environmentally friendly computerized dry
              process which can be situated locally and which can rapidly and cleanly sort
              aluminum scrap from mixtures of nonmagnetic metals at low cost.  This
              technology will replace the large, costly, and environmentally burdensome heavy
              media process that is current used. 

The commercial applications for this
              technology will be sorting of aluminum from automobile shredders. This
              technology will significantly reduce the environmental impact of sending these
              materials to landfills.  The materials recovered can be recycled and sold back
              to industry.
