Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a novel
              method of UV curing composite structures that will extend UV curing techniques
              to any size, thickness, or shape composite and with any type of reinforcing
              fiber by uniformly distributing UV light throughout a composite structure. The
              anticipated result is a new UV curing process that can be used in many diverse
              applications, including aircraft, automotive, spacecraft, and marine. The
              process will significantly reduce the cost of manufacturing composite parts,
              improve the performance of these parts (by reducing residual stresses), and
              open new applications for composite materials using this fabrication technique.
              This novel UV curing technique is most attractive for large or complex
              composite parts.

The proposed UV curing process has the potential to replace
              thermal curing for nearly all composite parts because it will achieve large
              cost and time savings while improving, or at least equaling, the thermally
              cured composite part performance. Additionally, the size limitations imposed by
              the use of an autoclave are removed because this UV curing process does not
              require an autoclave or any specialized tooling. Applications for this UV
              curing process exist in all fields, including next generation vehicle
              applications
