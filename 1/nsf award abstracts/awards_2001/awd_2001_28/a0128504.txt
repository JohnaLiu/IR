Collaborative Research:  Elevated Atmospheric CO2
              Alters Plant Detritus Nutritional Quality: Effects on Microbial and Detritivore
              Food Webs in Aquatic Ecosystems.

Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)
              resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels, directly affects the
              photosynthesis rate, growth, and chemical make-up of tree foliage.  The
              investigators have demonstrated that when aspen trees are grown under elevated
              CO2 levels, their leaves contain less nitrogen and higher concentrations of
              plant defense compounds (phenolic compounds, lignins and tannins), which
              renders them less nutritious to their animal and microorganism consumers. 
              Since small headwater streams in forested landscapes rely heavily on tree leaf
              litter to fuel their food webs, parallel field and laboratory studies will
              measure the effect that the CO2-induced change in food quality of aspen leaf
              litter will have on the growth and reproduction of stream bacteria, fungi, and
              invertebrate consumers.  The difference in microbial and invertebrate growth
              rates in turn could affect food web structure and functions and carbon dynamics
              in aquatic ecosystems.
