This award supports Terry Orlando and students from MIT in a
              collaboration with Frank Wilhelm of the Department of Physics at the University
              of Munich, Germany.  The aim of the international project is to maximize the
              quantum coherence of superconducting quantum bits for possible use in a
              full-scale quantum computer.  The US side will conduct experiments, analyze
              quantum computing and control issues, and explore new coupling methods between
              qubits along with intrinsic decoherence mechanisms in the superconducting
              system.  The German side will provide indispensible theoretical models which
              will give quantitative predictions for application to the experiments.  The
              combined effort could result in new concepts of quantm computation, the
              realization of quantum gates, numerical tools to allow the explicit
              construction of control pulses, and new coupling schemes and decoherence
              mechanisms.  The work plan provides for extensive participation by graduate
              students in the international travel and research.
