Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will exploit the
              unique fluorescence and signal amplification qualities of poly(phenylene
              ethynylene)s in a nanoparticle format. This combines the intense solid-state
              fluorescence and sensing capabilities of poly(phenylene ethynylene)s (PPEs)
              with the many unique attributes of nanoparticles, including their tremendous
              surface area and their surface adsorptivity. In this project, a series of
              charged PPEs whose emissions span the color spectrum will be synthesized and
              systematically evaluated for the formation of stable, aqueous nanoparticle
              dispersions. They will be functionalized and conjugated to biologic recognition
              molecules (i.e. antibodies and nucleic acids). The Phase I effort will yield a
              series of functional, highly fluorescent nanoparticles which may be used
              directly for the labeling of biological molecules.
     The commercial
              applications of this project will be in standoff explosives detection for wide
              area mapping. Standoff, wide area mapping is of intense interest for military
              and humanitarian uses as well as for environmental remediation of explosives
              contamination.
