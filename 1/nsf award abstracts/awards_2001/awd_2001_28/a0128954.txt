This award is a renewal of an earlier award that supports A.V.
              Ramayya, Joseph Hamilton, and a graduate student from Vanderbilt University in
              a collaboration with Walter Greiner of the Department of Theoretical Physics at
              the University of Frankfurt, Germany.  The project will focus on understanding
              the mechanisms of cold (neutronless) fragmentation of nuclei.  The
              collaboration brings together the experimental expertise and facilities on the
              U.S. side with the theoretical capabilities of the German side.  Recently, new
              facilities (namely, large germanium arrays such as Gammasphere and Eurogram II)
              have made detailed spectroscopic studies of neutron-rich nuclei possible,
              resulting of observation of new structural features.  This in turn has led to
              some entirely new approaches to the study of fission.  The collaboration
              supported here will bring together experimentalists and theorists in a way that
              will significantly advance the field of nuclear fission.
