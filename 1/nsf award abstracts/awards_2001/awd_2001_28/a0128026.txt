Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is aimed at
              optimizing the mass-transport properties of the cathode electrode for high
              temperature (120C), and dry air operation. The overall objective is to
              fabricate complete catalyst coated membranes utilizing the newly engineered
              cathode electrode layer, and test the improvements in a high temperature(120C)
              fuel cell. A second objective is to understand the water and reactant transport
              mechanisms occurring in the cathode electrode that are limiting the operating
              temperature and requiring high levels of cathode humidification.  
     Major
              benefits could be realized if proton exchange membrane fuel cells could be
              operated under hotter (> 90C) and drier conditions on the air electrode. Higher
              operating temperatures allow for an easier system heat rejection and a greater
              anode tolerance to CO contaminants typically found in reformed hydrocarbon fuel
              streams. Similar benefits can also be realized in building co-gen applications
              where a higher temperature.
