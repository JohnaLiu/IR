Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will conduct
              research to design a system for the unit testing of modules. This system will
              operate by automatically capturing events at the boundary of the module under
              test while a client of the module executes test cases. These events will be
              logged to a file so that they can later be replayed to the module in isolation.
              It is proposed to use Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) techniques to implement
              this tool and to use a third-party open-source licensed tool named AspectJ to
              implement this tool for Java. 
     Unit testing solutions offer considerable
              cost-savings by automating the recording and playback of events for testing by
              organizations that either develop or use software.
