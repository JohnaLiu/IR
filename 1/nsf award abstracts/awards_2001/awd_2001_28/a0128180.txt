Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop
              microelectronic systems that will increase speed and capability combined with
              smaller size. As the patterning/feature size of microelectronics continues to
              decrease, the need for power systems of smaller physical size emerges as a
              critical need.  This project will develop novel microbatteries that will
              deliver a minimum-area, volumetric electrochemical energy source in a MEMS
              device. In order to realize minimum volume devices, the project approach will
              be to exploit zinc-air (Zn-air) chemistry that promises the highest energy
              density available for battery chemistries (36 J/mm3). The company has developed
              a novel microfabrication process for non-silicon materials, including polymers,
              ceramics, and glasses that will enable reliable microscale fabrication of
              Zn-air batteries using appropriate materials. In this way, miniaturization of
              the highest performance system will be realized.


The commercial potential
              of this project will be batteries that have increased life and will be smaller.
               This will help the electronics industry in reducing the size of many
              electronic and microelectronic devices.
