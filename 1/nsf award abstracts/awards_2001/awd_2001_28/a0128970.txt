Abstract    :
              
The proposed study will target Focus area I by examining preschooler's
              acquisition of the emergent literacy skills that provide the foundation for
              skilled reading in elementary school. Children from low-income backgrounds and
              families in which Standard English is not their first language face
              particularly high hurdles as they transition into early reading instruction.
              Moreover, teachers' understanding of the developmental processes involved in
              learning to read are critical for successful implementation of literacy
              curricula and successful use of formative assessment to tailor instructional
              strategies to children. Following on these needs this project will provide
              teachers with state of the art research based knowledge about how emergent
              literacy skills are directly linked to, and form the foundation for, skilled
              reading in the elementary school. Additionally, the project will provide
              important data on the validity of assessment procedures used to inform
              curricula.
