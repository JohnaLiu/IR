Abstract    :
               
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              demonstrate the feasibility of a distance coaching system for foreign language
              learners using the tandem method through electronic media (eTandem).  The
              objectives of the proposed research are to establish a fundamental
              understanding of issues and parameters affecting eTandem distance coaching and
              to demonstrate feasibility of an eTandem distance coaching system.  Language
              learners lacking access to foreign language learning opportunities will be
              targeted.  Rural and disadvantaged learners are key target groups.  Tandem is
              an autonomous form of language learning where two native speakers of different
              languages form a reciprocal learning partnership.  Tandem coaching was
              conceived, researched and demonstrated to improve the effectiveness of the
              tandem learning process.  Since 1994, Tandem has been practiced using
              electronic media (eTandem) with great success.  The concept of distance
              coaching for eTandem learners, not previously researched, offers high potential
              to advance language learning and intercultural exchange for an international
              audience.
     Parvis proffers a system, eTandem coaching, with potential for
              a dramatic impact on distance foreign language learning worldwide, serving a
              wide range of possible customers from K-12 to adult education.
