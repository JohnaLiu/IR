Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an
              economical platform technology for producing well-dispersed polymer
              nanocomposite films. Emphasis has been placed on the mechanical property
              advantages of mixing nano-sized clay flakes into conventional polymers.
              Processing techniques include sol-gel, various vacuum-based deposition methods,
              physical mixing, gas phase synthesis, chemical synthesis, liquid dispersions,
              and mixed solvent casting. To overcome potential production problems, a
              low-cost alternative technology, the modified Combustion Chemical Vapor
              Deposition (CCVD) process can be utilized. The modified CCVD process allows for
              the incorporation of nanoparticles of various sizes, distributions, and types
              in the polymer matrix. As a test bed for this platform technology,
              nanocomposite films for light emitting diode (LED) with voltage dependent
              wavelength output will be synthesized for display applications.

The
              commercial application of this project will be in the polymer based LED segment
              of the flat panel display market. A low-cost, voltage variable LED system that
              is less expensive to manufacture, more reliable and with a longer life-span
              could have a significant impact in capturing more of this market.
