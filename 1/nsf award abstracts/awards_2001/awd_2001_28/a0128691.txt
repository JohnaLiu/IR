Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project will develop a
              highly-parallel, mass-selected purification system for large pharmaceutical
              drug libraries. The need for high-throughput purification is driven by the
              industry recognition that combinatorial chemistry samples must still be
              purified even after chemical screening. This is a daunting task considering the
              exponentially increasing number of drug candidates being synthesized by
              combinatorial and parallel methods. This proposal will examine monolithic
              parallel flash chromatography and preparative liquid chromatography
              configurations. The key enabling technology is photoionization mass
              spectrometry, which permits accurate molecular detection in mixtures of
              compounds without the problems of competition-for-charge and ion suppressions
              that plague conventional ionization methods. This will make it possible to
              monitor several chromatography columns at the same time. The goal of the
              project is to have a purification system in place that has a practical
              purification rate of 1 min per sample (16 parallel purifications in about 16
              min) corresponding to a potential 16 hr daily rate of 960 sample purifications
              per day. 

The commercial application of this project will be in the
              important niche market of molecular analysis and screening for drug discovery.
