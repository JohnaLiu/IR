Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a rapid,
              low-cost, low-temperature, scalable, environmentally benign method for the
              deposition of crystalline oxide thin films. The specific Phase I goals are to
              demonstrate the feasibility of developing procedures for growing these specific
              high-quality thin-film crystals and to evaluate their crystal structure,
              optical properties and texture. 

The commercial benefits of this type of
              processing method would revolutionize applications ranging from electronics to
              medicine to energy.
