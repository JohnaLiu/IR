Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop the
              technology to perform Spectroscopic Imaging Polarimetry using Antenna Arrays
              with Integrated Diodes (SIP-AAID) to measure both the amplitude and phase of
              the light in an image at each pixel. Typically, visible and IR detectors /
              imagers measure only the intensity of light, ignoring potential information in
              the phase. Since antenna size 
and diode capacitance scales with
              electromagnetic radiation wavelength for optimum collection, this SIP will
              require the use of antenna's with features < 100 nm, and diodes with layer
              thicknesses < 5 nm and geometric areas < 50 nm, for visible and IR light. The
              development of a high resolution SIP-AAID that determines the complete
              polarization state of light at each pixel over a broad range of wavelengths is
              expected to revolutionize the IR and visible imaging detector industry. The
              relatively low cost and the unique capabilities of the SIP-AAID, when compared
              to present IR detectors, will likely provide a market pull for applications
              ranging from in/on-line process and product control to surveillance with
              unmatched recognition and tracking abilities.
     The commercial applications
              of this project will be in space and defence related industries.
