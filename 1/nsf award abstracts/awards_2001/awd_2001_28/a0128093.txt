Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will  develop 
              a high volume/high pressure RDR-MOCVD nitride production tool. Two fundamental
              problems will be addressed. The first is the need for large area substrate
              quality and the second is the need for large area/high volume MOCVD nitride
              epitaxy production tools. This project will demonstrate a scaleable tool to
              meet these needs.

The commercial applications of this project will be in
              electronics and optoelectronic device markets.
