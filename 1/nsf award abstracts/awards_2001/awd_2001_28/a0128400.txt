Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is for the
              development of platinum catalysts for hydrogen/air proton-exchange membrane
              fuel cells. The proposed catalysts will be more active than the current
              catalysts. The goal is to develop advanced fuel cell catalysts that are
              sufficiently active to meet DOE's goal for precious metal loading for fuel
              cells.   

More active Platinum  catalysts will help commercialize
              hydrogen/air proton-exchange membrane fuel cells for vehicle and low- to
              medium-power generator applications. Fuel cell manufacturers and users will
              benefit greatly if the proposed research becomes successful.
