Abstract    :
              The Information Technology Association of America (ITAA), the nation's leading
              IT association representing more than 500 corporate members from the
              information technology industry, proposes a pilot initiative to establish a
              framework for substantial engagement of its member companies with a core group
              of minority-serving institutions representing the more than 105 Hispanic
              Serving Institutions, 203 Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and 32
              Tribal Colleges and Universities across the U.S.  This effort will be directly
              responsive to the recommendations of the bipartisan Commission on the
              Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering and Technology
              (CAWMSET)  with respect to improving access to and the quality of higher
              education for groups underrepresented in science, engineering, and technology. 
              

The broad goal is to link the resources and expertise of ITAA and its
              members with those minority-serving institutions demonstrating the commitment
              and capacity to improve the technological and pedagogical infrastructure
              devoted to student learning, faculty and student research, and administrative
              processes.  

Through this initiative, ITAA will pursue two major
              activities:

1. Assist in developing and implementing customized campus
              technology plans for specific schools through:
a) Identification, assessment,
              and refinement of user needs;
b) Recommendation and technical assistance in
              procurement of baseline systems and technology

2. Provide knowledge
              enhancement activities through:
a) Student and faculty internships in ITAA
              member firms
b) Recommendation of specific curricular and research activity
              enhancements
c) E-mentoring of students, faculty, and administrators
d) ITAA
              practitioners-on-loan as potential academic and administrative
              consultants

The ITAA project will complement other NSF grants, including
              EDUCAUSE (Award # 9980537) and the Council on Competitiveness (Award# 0110028).
               This project will also build upon the quality assurance provided by merit
              review of proposals submitted to the HBCU-UP and TCUP programs at NSF.
