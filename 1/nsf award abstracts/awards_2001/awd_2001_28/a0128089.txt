Abstract    :
              As part of the CASES-99 program (Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange
              Study-1999), the PI measured the temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind
              velocity with high resolution in time and altitude using instruments suspended
              from a tethered kite or, in calm conditions, a tethered blimp.  Preliminary
              analysis of the data has revealed sharp temperature inversions, intermittent
              bursts of turbulence, and apparent wave phenomena, all with unprecedented
              resolution.  This grant supports the continuing analysis of CASES-99 data.  The
              analysis is focused on the following objectives:
(1) statistical
              characterization of the turbulence in selected homogeneous layers;
(2)
              investigation of turbulence in the vicinity of horizontal interfaces separating
              layers with different turbulence characteristics;
(3) study of turbulence
              intermittence, including calculation of spectra of the energy dissipation rate
              e and the temperature structure parameter Ct2;
(4) examination of the
              structure of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and other wave phenomena in
              collaboration with large-eddy simulation modelers;
(5) entering other
              collaborations with CASES-99 researchers in the analysis of different data
              sets.

This research advances the fundamental understanding of atmospheric
              turbulence and enables improved parameterization of the diffusion and vertical
              transport of heat, momentum, and material in the nocturnal atmospheric boundary
              layer.
