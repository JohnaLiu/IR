              Project Summary

Endophytes are fungi that live internally in plants but do
              not cause disease. Instead, endophytes are thought to benefit the plant by
              increasing resistance to drought, herbivores, and seed predators, pathogens and
              root feeders and increasing germination rates, nutrient uptake, and competitive
              abilities. Endophytes are found in all plants, including agronomic crops and
              turf grasses. They are used in turf grasses to increase performance of grasses,
              but may also cause harm livestock because of their toxic effects. However,
              little is known about the role of endophytes in native grasses. The benefits of
              endophytes are often not the same as in agronomic grasses. Our research seeks
              to determine the costs and benefits of asexual, seed borne endophytes in the
              genus Neotyphodium in two widespread SW native grasses, Arizona fescue and
              sleepy grass. Our goals are to experimentally test the cost and benefits of
              Neotyphodium infection depending on plant and endophyte genotype and
              environment. We will implement two major field experiments that control plant
              genotype and endophyte infection, soil moisture levels and herbivory by
              invertebrates and vertebrates. Our results will provide insights into basic
              interactions between endophytes and their host grasses, and may have important
              applied aspects related to forage grasses.
