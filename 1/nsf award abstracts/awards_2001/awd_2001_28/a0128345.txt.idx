Abstract    :
              This workshop will address the new research and education challenges posed by
              the advent of embedded computing as a discipline.  Workshop participants
              include embedded system experts from both academia and industry.  The workshop
              report includes:  1) a statement of pressing research problems posed in
              embedded computing; 2) recommendations about important research areas relating
              to embedded computing; and 3) viewpoints on how the discipline of embedded
              computing fits in with existing computing disciplines and specialties.
