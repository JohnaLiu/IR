Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and
              characterize a novel ceramic material and microcomponent fabrication technique
              for two different industrial sectors: the fiber-optic communications industry
              and the chemical industry. Current processes for microcomponent fabrication,
              primarily based on silicon processing technology are expensive, and often do
              not meet the production rates required for optical component (fiber-connectors,
              beam splitters) fabrication or possess the desired high-temperature performance
              for chemical industry applications (micro-channel devices for gas
              separation/reforming). The objective of this project is to develop a
              cost-effective technique for microfabrication of components with properties
              and/or production efficiency comparable to or superior than silicon technology.
              The process will use a low-temperature, net-shape fabrication technique that is
              expected to be efficient, cost-effective, scalable and environmentally friendly
              (no-byproducts). 

The commercial benefits will be an alternative to silicon
              processing technology. The high production capacity and tight dimensional
              tolerances for components fabricated using this material/technique makes it an
              attractive option for optic fiber component manufacturers. The high achievable
              surface areas and the inherent thermochemical stability of ceramics make this
              material very attractive for fabrication of microchannel devices for gas
              separation/reformation.
