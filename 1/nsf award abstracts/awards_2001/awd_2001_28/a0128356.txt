Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will help launch
              the development of a Metainformation Engine. Every application could be
              supplemented by a rich set of links; most items on display screens should have
              multiple links tailored to current task and preferences. The Metainformation
              Engine will automatically generate links within the majority of computer
              applications, generate metadata about the application elements and the
              relationships underlying each link (which users can examine for better
              understanding), and provide several hypermedia-style services such as
              annotation. Instead of keyword search or lexical analysis on the display text,
              the Metainformation Engine generates links on application elements based on
              application structure and context. These links lead to related elements in the
              same application or in related applications or databases. Integration requires
              few or no modifications to existing applications.
     This product will be
              valuable to enterprises as they attempt to collect and integrate new and legacy
              information meaningfully across corporations and the entire supply chain.
