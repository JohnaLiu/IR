This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in condensed
              matter physics involves research groups at Cornell University and the Center
              for Low Temperature Physics Research in Grenoble, France.  David M. Lee, Jeevak
              M. Parpia and John Reppy lead the US effort; Yuriy Bunkov and Henri Godrin lead
              the French group.  The focus of the research is superfluid 3He (helium) - a
              unique coherent quantum system whose order parameter shows the complex breaking
              of gauge and rotation symmetries.  The main areas to be studied are the
              relaxation domains in bulk superfluid 3HeB and the nature of the superfluidity
              of liquid 3He in aerogel.  The project involves nuclear magnetic resonance
              (NMR) studies of 3He at high magnetic fields and at ultra low temperatures. 
              The Cornell group's experiments include exploration of magnetic field
              dependence of the temperature of catastrophic relation and sound propagation
              and heat transport in aerogel as a function of magnetic field.  This is
              complemented by French NMR studies of superfluid 3He in aerogel at the limit of
              ultra low temperatures and theoretical investigations and numerical simulations
              of catastrophic relaxation. 

This award represents the US side of joint
              proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research
              (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses of the US
              investigators and postdoctoral researchers.  The CNRS will support visits to US
              of the French participants. The collaboration will advance understanding of 3He
              systems and applications in cosmology and high-energy physics.
