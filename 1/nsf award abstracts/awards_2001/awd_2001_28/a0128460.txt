Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will eliminate
              coking in ethylene furnaces and dusting in steam reformers. Ethylene and
              hydrogen, two very important feedstocks, are produced by processing hydrocarbon
              feed streams at high temperatures. Unfortunately, when hydrocarbons come into
              contact with iron and nickel (major components of steel) at high temperature,
              reactions can occur which cause coking in ethylene production and formation of
              metal oxide particulate (dusting) in hydrogen production by steam reforming.
              The lost time required to decoke ethylene crackers and the removal of metal
              oxide particulate from steam reformers are costly. Although pyrolysis and steam
              reforming are carried out under different conditions, the initial steps in
              coking and dusting are identical, the formation of iron and nickel carbides. In
              this project, additives will be developed that bind strongly to iron and nickel
              on the steel surface, eliminating the formation of these metal
              carbides.

Additives that reduce coke in ethylene crackers and eliminate
              dusting in steam reforming would find immediate application in both ethylene
              and hydrogen production industries. These problems are significant sources of
              cost to each of the industries and their elimination would result in measurable
              reductions in price for both ethylene and hydrogen.
