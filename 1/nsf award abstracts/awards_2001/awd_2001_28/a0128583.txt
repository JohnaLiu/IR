Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              a design approach for a high energy density hydrogen/air Proton Exchange
              Membrane (PEM) fuel cell. The proposed research will demonstrate a means of
              creating sections of membrane, integral with the parent material, which are
              thermoplastic in nature and which are impermeable to hydrogen, oxygen and water
              for sealing edges. The same membrane modification will be used to create
              narrow, inerted sections of membrane to serve as borders of inactive membrane
              between segmented, series-connected, coplanar fuel cells. The material
              innovations will be demonstrated in actual 50 cm 2 PEM fuel cells, both single
              and segmented. Ionic conductivity and water and gas permeability will be
              determined to show the extent of inactivation in treated regions. Tensile
              strength tests will be conducted to demonstrate the integrity of the structures
              and the strength of thermally bonded edge seals. 

PEM segmented or coplanar
              have potential fuel cells applications where exceptionally long total service
              lives (>30,000 Hrs) of operating times are required. Long service life is
              required for residential applications, battery replacement and standby power
              supplies for critical computer and control facilities.
