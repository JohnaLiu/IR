This three-year award for US-France collaboration on
              biogeochemical studies in Antarctica involves Mark H. Thiemens and students at
              the University of California at San Diego and Michel Legrand and Robert Delmas
              of the Glaciology and Physical Environment Laboratory (CNRS, Grenoble, France).
               They will study atmospheric sulfur and nitrogen cycles in Antarctica using gas
              concentration and a combination of sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen isotopic
              measurements.  Multi-isotope ratio measurement and integration of mass
              independent isotopic chemistry will be employed. 

Specifically, sulfur and
              nitrogen species at the French Antarctic station will be studied using gas
              concentration, aerosols, size distribution, and composition in addition to
              isotopic ratio measurements.  Concentrated and isotopic measurements of ionic
              species trapped in the Vostok ice cores, currently in stored in France, also
              will be investigated.  The US researchers bring to this collaboration expertise
              in ice analysis.  This is complemented by French expertise in ice core
              chemistry and access to French Antarctic research facilities and special ice
              cores. Studies of Antarctic ice cores will advance understanding of the
              Antarctic atmosphere, ozone depletion, and the causes of climate transition.

              
This award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the
              CNRS.  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigators
              and students. The CNRS will support visits by French researchers to the United
              States.
