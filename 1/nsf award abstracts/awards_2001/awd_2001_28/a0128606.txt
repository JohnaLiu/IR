Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will develop a
              hybrid, co-flow laser material deposition system in order to enhance the
              ability to fabricate materials with nanocrystalline microstructures and to
              produce miniature, three dimensional structural components such as dental
              implants and stents directly from a CAD (Computer Aided Design)  solid model.
              This work will leverage two technologies previously developed by the
              researchers : (a) Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS), and (b) Direct Write
              Electronics (DWE). The LENS process provides the ability to fabricate large
              structures directly from a CAD solid model, whereas the DWE process provides
              the ability to fabricate microelectronic components directly from a CAD
              representation.

The principal commercial application of this project will be
              in the field of miniature biomedical components. Additional applications are
              expected in the field of electronics and defense.
