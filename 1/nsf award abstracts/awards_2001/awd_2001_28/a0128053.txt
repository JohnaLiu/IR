This grant provides four years of continued support for
              the operation of the International Seismological Centre (ISC) affiliated with
              Oxford University.  The ISC is supported by 50 member organization around the
              world for the production of a global summary of earthquake hypocenters,
              magnitudes, arrival times and other phase measurements.  ISC also compiles an
              annual Bulletin of these data after further analysis of the data.  The Bulletin
              provides a comprehensive database of refined earthquake hypocenters with
              redundant and suspected erroneous data filtered.  The Catalogue and Bulletin
              are available via CD-ROM to researchers worldwide interested in earthquake
              hazards, seismotectonics , global tomography and earthquake physics.  All ISC
              data are also now available via the internet.
