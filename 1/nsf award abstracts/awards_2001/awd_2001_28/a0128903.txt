This three-year award supports U.S.-France collaboration
              between David B. Stern of the Boyce Thompson Institute at Cornell University
              and Silva Lerbs-Mache of the University Joseph Fourier in Grenoble, France. 
              They lead a collaborative program involving reciprocal visits of postdoctoral
              researchers, graduate and undergraduate students, and faculty researchers.  The
              project utilizes a multi-faceted approach to the study of transcription in
              organelles, specifically, mitochondria and plastids.  The objectives are:  (1)
              to use reverse genetic approaches in maize cell cultures and in Arabidopsis
              plants to reveal the functions of proteins in organelle transcription and plant
              development; (2) to reconstitute the active polymerase through overexpression
              of putative components; and (3) to use proteomics approach to discover any
              unknown subunits.  The US researchers bring to this collaboration expertise in
              reverse genetics in maize to discern organelle protein function.  This is
              complemented by French laboratory strengths in Arabidopsis and RNA polymerases
              biochemistry.  Reciprocal visits of junior faculty and students are emphasized
              to add an international dimension to their activities and to develop
              international connections early in their careers.

This award represents the
              US side of joint proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for
              Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses of
              the US investigators, postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate
              students.  The CNRS will support visits to US of the French participants. The
              collaboration will advance understanding of organelle biogenesis and plant
              development.
