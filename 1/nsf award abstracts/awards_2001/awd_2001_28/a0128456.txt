Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I Project will
              further develop a nanostructure technology for use as the active material of a
              fiber optic laser. Prior research  has demonstrated that self-organized III-V
              semiconductor nanostructures grown on GaAs (gallium arsenide) substrate can
              operate as the gain region of a 1.3 micron wavelength laser, and that these
              structures are effective in realizing vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers
              (VCSELs). 1.3 micron VCSELs are a key device for high speed fiber optic links
              for use in Ethernet and other metro access and metro applications. This project
              will have access to a high quality epitaxial growth facility with the
              capability to grow the III-V nanostructures and VCSEL mirrors and to develop a
              broad range of electronic and optoelectronic device materials.

The
              commercial application of this project is in the fiber optics communications
              market. It is estimated that the market for a 1.3 micron VCSEL could reach
              close to $1 billion within the next 10 years.
