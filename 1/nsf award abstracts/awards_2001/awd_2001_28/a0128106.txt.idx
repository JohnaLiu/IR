Abstract    :
              0128106 Gordon  	This award will provide funds for the support of a workshop
              on climate-scale variations in the Southern Ocean to be held at the
              Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University in October 2001.   The
              task of the workshop will be to produce a document for the US CLIVAR Scientific
              Steering Committee, presenting priority research and sustained observational
              activities within the Southern Ocean that reach Clivar objectives.  Four themes
              are presented to help guide the process:  (1)  Ocean circulation and
              overturning within the circumpolar belt, including the Antarctic Circumpolar
              Current, intermediate water, and subantarctic mode water production.  (2) 
              Ocean circulation and overturning within the Antarctic zone and regional
              sea-air fluxes, including processes leading to ventilation of the deep ocean. 
              (3) Large scale variability of the Southern Ocean and its relationship to
              global climate phenomena, including the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave.  (4)  Ocean
              circulation and its regulation of air-sea partitioning of carbon dioxide.  The
              workshop participants will also consider new observational techniques
              applicable to the Southern Ocean environment, particularly those that require
              special ship capable for handling of new observing platforms (e.g. autonomous
              vehicles). 	The Southern Ocean is the major site of interocean exchange and
              ocean overturning. It provides a heat source for the atmosphere, regulating to
              a significant degree the distribution of sea ice and perhaps even affecting
              glacial ice mass balance. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current and descent of
              "antarctic" waters shape much of the global ocean stratification. Interannual
              and lower frequency variability within the Southern Ocean has been linked to
              patterns of global climate variability. The CLIVAR SSC has endorsed the
              convening of this workshop, recognizing that the  Southern Ocean clearly has
              relevance to CLIVAR goals. ***
