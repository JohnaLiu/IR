Hartmann
This award supports Dieter Hartmann and students from Clemson
              University in a collaboration with Sylvio Klose of the Thuering Observatory in
              Tautenburg, Germany.  The aim of the international project is to study the
              temporal evolution of gamma-ray burst afterglows.  Both groups have access to
              small and midsize telescopes.  The U.S. side uses data from the fully robotic
              Super-LOTIS telescope at the Kit Peak National Observatory.  The German side
              has access to the Tautenburg two-meter telescope as well as time on various
              international large-aperture telescopes.  By combining data collected by both
              groups, they will analyze gamma-ray burst afterglow light curves and possible
              color changes on time scales ranging from seconds to days. The work plan
              provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the international
              travel and research.
