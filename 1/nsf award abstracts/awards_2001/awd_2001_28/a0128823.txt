Slavin
This award supports Andei Slavin and students from Oakland
              University in a collaboration with Burkard Hillebrands of the Physics
              Department at the University of Kaiserslautern, Germany.  The project is
              supplementary to the ongoing award from the Division of Materials research on
              the "Dynamics of Linear and Nonlinear Spin Waves in Magnetic Films."  The aim
              of the international project is to develop a complementary research
              collaboration between the theoretical research group in the US and the German
              experimental group to work on solutions to problems involving confinement of
              linear and non-linear spin waves in magnetic films and particles.  Such
              solutions will have important applications in magnetic recording, and will
              advance the state of our fundamental understanding of magnetic excitations. 
              The work plan provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the
              international travel and research.
