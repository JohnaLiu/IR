Abstract    :
              0128805 Bilham    Description:  This award supports a US-India workshop on
              Seismological, Geodynamic and Engineering Implications of the M=7.6, 26
              January, Bhuj Earthquake that will be held October 3-5, 2001 in New Delhi. 
              Professor Roger Bilham, University of Colorado Boulder will convene a three-day
              international meeting for scientists and engineers to discuss the scientific
              findings and implications of this earthquake.  With fatalities exceeding
              20,000, this was the most disastrous event in India's recorded history.  The
              first day of the workshop will be devoted to seismological, geologic and
              geodetic investigations, the second to acceleration and engineering effects,
              and to the characterization of seismic risk in India, the third to general
              discussions on the seismotectonic implications of recent earthquakes in India
              and to their association with plate boundary processes and underlying plate
              dynamics.     Scope:  The Bhuj event had a number of features that resemble
              the mid-continent 19th century earthquakes of North America.  The expectation
              is that discussions will provide insights into the causes of the Bhuj
              earthquake and of mid-cratonic events in general.  This will be a forum for
              Indian and foreign scientists that have undertaken relevant post-seismic and
              theoretical investigations to compare their findings.  The Indian Department of
              Science and Technology is cofunding this workshop; it is jointly funded by
              NSF's  Division of International Programs and Division of Earth Sciences.
