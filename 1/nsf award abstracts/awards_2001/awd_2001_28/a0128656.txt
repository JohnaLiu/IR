This three-year award supports US-France collaboration in
              control systems between Mark W. Spong of the University of Illinois and Romeo
              Ortega of the Signal and Systems Laboratory at SUPELEC, a French center for
              research in electrical engineering. The objectives are to investigate passive
              nonlinear control of networked control systems, in particular, systems
              involving bilateral remote operation (teleoperation) over unreliable
              communication networks.  The problem is motivated by interest in wireless
              communication in embedded real time control systems and the use of the Internet
              as a communication medium in teleoperated and networked control systems.  The
              research will advanced understanding of how to design and utilize mobile,
              intelligent robotic systems with local intelligence for communication over
              unreliable networks with other robots and human operators.  The researchers
              plan to answer: How sensory, command and control information are shared over
              such networks and how much local intelligence is needed to guarantee
              performance and stability when network communications are degraded.  The US
              investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in passivity-based
              networked control systems.  This is complemented by French theoretical
              expertise in nonlinear control and robotics.  Potential applications of their
              results include work in hazardous and remote environments, surveillance,
              search, and rescue robots, autonomous vehicles and autonomous locomotion
              systems, haptic devices, remote construction, and remote surgery.
 
This
              award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the CNRS. 
              NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator.  The
              CNRS will support visits by French researchers and graduate students to the
              United States.
