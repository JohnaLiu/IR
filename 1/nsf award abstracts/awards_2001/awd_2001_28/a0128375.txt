Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will establish a method
              to quantitatively predict the  level of micromixing and mass transport in
              single-phase and multiphase fluid systems that are generated by a novel
              low-frequency acoustic technology.  The primary Phase I objective is to
              demonstrate the feasibility for development of a theoretical understanding of
              the governing mechanisms for the transformation of high-intensity,
              low-frequency, acoustic energy radiation into useful work for mixing and mass
              transport applications in multi-phase fluids.  A secondary, but essential,
              objective will be to develop the transfer functions coupling the acoustic
              transducer to the radiated acoustic energy in the fluid.  The models will be
              accompanied by experiment methods that will correlate classical micromixing amd
              mass transport techniques with acoustic field experiment data.  The proposed
              work will result in establishing a fundamental understanding of the governing
              mechanisms for acoustically-driven, single-phase and multiphase fluid
              processes, as well as fluid-particle interactions.  The analytical models are
              essential for exploitation of the industrial market by innovative low-frequency
              acoustic mixing methods that are emerging. 
	Mixing is the most common
              operation encountered in the Chemical Processing Industries.  In North America
              alone, the conventional industrial mixer market is between $200 million and
              $250 million annually.  Other industries reliant upon mixing and mass transport
              include food, petroleum, mining, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, water
              treatment and municipal waste water treatment.
