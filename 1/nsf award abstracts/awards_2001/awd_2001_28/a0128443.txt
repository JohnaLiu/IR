Abstract    :
              
     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project will create
              image processing based software that tracks objects using real-time video input
              for use in the teaching of mathematics and physical science.  Image processing
              has not previously been used in educational motion detection.  Compared to the
              currently used methods-real-time graphing and frame-by-frame analysis of stored
              video-the proposed innovation will have many advantages, such as the
              simultaneous display of video and graphs and the automatic generation of
              stroboscopic images. Phase I has two research objectives.  To develop a system
              that can track one object and display a graph of its motion on a computer
              screen in real time, and to investigate with teachers and students the
              applications of this system to understanding motion, graphing, shapes,
              visualization, and projection.
     Used in conjunction with inquiry-based
              curriculum, the system proffered by Paul Antonucci & Associates could improve
              teaching and learning of physical science and mathematics nationwide, and it
              expands the possibilities for exploring motion in real-world situations.  This
              innovation will create the opportunity to surpass in learning effectiveness and
              ease-of-use the technologies now used widely in high school and college
              physics.  In addition it will potentially reach a much larger
              market-mathematics classrooms from middle school through college.
