Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses
              security of operating systems. This approach is based on developing
              specifications that capture security-relevant behaviors of programs, and
              constraining their execution to ensure adherence to these specifications. Since
              all security-relevant operations are administered through system calls, program
              behaviors are modeled in terms of sequences of system calls made by them,
              together with their arguments.

The system will achieve enhanced security
              without compromising on functionality by (a) being able to protect against
              known as well as novel kinds of attacks, (b) maintaining a very low false-alarm
              rate, and (c) reduced maintenance needs.
