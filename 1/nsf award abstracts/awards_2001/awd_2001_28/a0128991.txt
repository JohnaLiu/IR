"Inertially Unstable Currents and Internal Waves"
In
              the ocean, inertial instability is thought to be the primary mechanism that
              maintains anticyclonic shears and vortices at stable and marginally stable
              values.  This project will utilize a series of numerical simulations to study
              the evolution of inertial instability in detail. Theoretical predictions will
              be made for the occurrence and physical location of the instabilities initial
              growth from a variety of ocean models of vortices and currents.  Both methods
              will be used to help determine the nature of the internal wave radiation that
              is generated by the inertial instability.  Analytical and numerical work will
              then be undertaken to investigate the complex behavior of packets of dimensions
              and amplitudes consistent with the oceanic investigations.
