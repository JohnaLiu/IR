Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              prototype equipment to achieve control of acoustic shearwaves in ferromagnetic
              materials, and introduce innovative technology to enable scientists and
              engineers to utilize variable shear wave polarization as a new tool for
              measuring and characterizing material properties. This will greatly enhance
              non-destructive testing of metals.To establish the feasibility of the proposed
              technique, a specially configured Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT)
              will be used to demonstrate electronic steering of shear wave polarization.
              Acoustoelastic relationships, relative to polarization angle, will then be
              analyzed for several steel samples of varying microstructure with the objective
              of establishing a measurement method capable of accurately determining
              longitudinal stress, independent of sample microstructure.
     Commercial
              applications exist for both rapid, in-situ, nondestructive assessment of
              microstructure, and for longitudinal stress measurement in steel members.
              Specific examples include monitoring and process control at critical stages of
              steel manufacture and thermomechanical processing; improving railroad safety
              through early detection and preemptive correction of extreme rail stress that
              can contribute to train derailments; and verification of correct load
              distribution in older or compromised steel structures such as bridges,
              stadiums, factories and multi-story steelframe buildings.
