Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an
              innovative system for reliably and inexpensively attaching medium- to
              heavy-weight equipment to thin-skin composite sandwich structures.  This will
              be accomplished with proprietary metallic foam (patent applied) and polymeric
              partial inserts with functionally graded stiffness.  This is different from the
              stiffness of the sandwich material and is set to the stiffness and strength
              required to carry the equipment.  By varying the stiffness of the insert from
              low to high, it will be possible to carry the weight of the equipment without
              damaging the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) core material.  Inserts of metal foam and
              polymer composite with varying density and stiffness will be fabricated by a
              patented extrusion, free-form fabrication technology.  Due to the materials low
              density, less than one or two pounds of the attachment material will be of
              adequate volume for a composite attachment system.  Thus, the material cost of
              the attachment system will be small relative to the cost of a traditional
              sandwich composite structure.

Potential applications are anticipated in
              manufacture of vehicles for commercial transportation, e.g., buses, trains,
              small crafts, and aircrafts.
