Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate a
              unique method of producing hybrid metal ceramic composite friction
              materials.Friction materials are the replacement elements in braking,clutch and
              transmission systems.In this effort,Thor Technologies,Inc.will team with Los
              Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)and an aircraft braking systems company to
              integrate two novel technologies into an innovative method of producing hybrid
              ceramic composite brakes.Preliminary studies with the
              Polymer
Infiltration/Microwave Pyrolysis (PIMP)processing method indicate that
              it is capable of producing fiber-reinforced ceramic brakes with integral metal
              features.Such ceramic brakes will offer substantial competitive advantages over
              traditional friction materials,and should integrate seamlessly with existing
              systems.Thor Technologies will use the LANL Gyrotron Facility to produce hybrid
              ceramic composite frcition materials through the PIMP process.These will be
              evaluated through dynamometer tests conducted at the braking systems
              company.These tests will validate hybrid ceramic composites for friction
              applications,and will justify full-scale development of the PIMP manufacturing
              process.Thor Technologies,Inc.and the Principal Investigator are uniquely well
              positioned to meet the technical challenges of producing ceramic
friction
              products and transitioning them to the market.
