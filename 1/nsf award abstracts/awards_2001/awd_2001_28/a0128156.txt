Abstract    :
                   This Phase I SBIR program will investigate and develop a new process for
              depositing catalysts on fuel cell membrane and electrode assemblies (MEAs). The
              proposed process for producing reliable MEAs is conducive to high volume
              manufacturing using fabrication tools familiar to industry. In addition to high
              rate production capability, the proposed process optimizes the
              electrode/catalyst structure allowing us to reduce the catalyst loading that
              further reduces the MEA cost. This program will demonstrate the process in
              operating fuel cell stacks and evaluate the economics of employing the process
              on a larger scale.   
     The proton exchange membrane fuel cell is a
              promising power source for vehicles with residential, stationary, and portable
              power applications.
