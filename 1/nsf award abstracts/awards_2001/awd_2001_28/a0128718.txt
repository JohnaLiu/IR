Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a a dry,
              strong, compliant adhesive tape that is removable and reusable. This will be
              based on a novel dendritic architecture consisting of a compliant velvet of
              micron-diameter carbon fibers, each with a compliant carbon nanotube array on
              its tip. Pressed against a surface, each nanotube array will make contact at
              multiple points on an atomic scale, resulting in a strong intermolecular (van
              der Waals) adhesive force. The Phase I project is expected to accomplish
              fabrication of dendritic structures, examination of these structures with
              electron microscopy and measurement of adhesive properties to a variety of
              surfaces under varying environmental conditions (i.e. air, vacuum, elevated
              temperature). 


The commercial applications of this project will be in a
              broad range of markets, extending from aerospace to consumer electronics.
