Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop the
              technology for fabrication of M50 bearing steel coatings that are superhard,
              adherent, nanocrystalline, homometallic (an integrated layer without
              interface), and resistant to scratch and corrosion. These homometallic coatings
              will be similar in composition to the metallic substrates onto which they will
              be deposited. However, their nanocrystalline structures will provide
              enhancement in important properties such as hardness, toughness, and wear and
              corrosion resistance, without the brittleness, poor adhesion and other problems
              associated with conventional ceramic coatings. Prior research has demonstrated
              that nanocrystalline (3-40 nm grains) Co-Cr deposited onto Co-Cr-Mo substrates
              possesses hardness close to that of some ceramics (18-26 GPa, 400% increase)
              without the associated problems with adhesion to metallic substrates, and that
              fabrication of nanocrystalline (<40 nm crystals) Ti, with hardness of 12-14
              GPa, can be accomplished.  

The commercial application of this project will
              be in the manufacture of aircraft, boats and ground vehicles.
