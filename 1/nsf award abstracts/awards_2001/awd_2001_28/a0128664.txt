Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable
              design professionals and their clients to produce concise and accurate
              statements of project requirements. The initial work will be done for the
              architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry.  The proposed
              requirements definition tool empowers businesses to develop on-line user needs
              and analysis statements according to customers' preferences and to model, in
              real-time, the type of constructed project desired. With superior understanding
              of clients' needs, designers can shorten the product delivery cycle and provide
              an end product with greater customer satisfaction.

The potential market for
              this innovation is since it can be used in any segment of the AEC industry such
              as industrial, office, commercial, residential, hotel, and education. Firms
              producing large, complex products-such as aircraft, flight simulators, and
              telecommunication systems-have the same need for early, accurate identification
              and statement of requirements.
