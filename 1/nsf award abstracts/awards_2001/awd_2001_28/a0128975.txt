This award supports Jerome Moloney and students from the
              University of Arizona in a collaboration with Wulfhard Lange of the Department
              of Applied Physics at the University of Muenster, Germany.  The aim of the
              international project is to make a systematic study of the spatio-temporal
              dynamics of technologically vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VSCEL)
              devices.  The effort will bring a leading experimental group in Germany
              together with the US group whose expertise is in modeling and simulation.  The
              US group has established a unique capability to calculate from first principles
              the full many-body microscopic optical response of a great variety of
              semiconductor quantum well materials.  These simulation tools will be extended
              to the study of VCSEL structures in order to investigate, among other
              phenomena, the role of oxidation layers and their geometry in controlling
              current spreading and diffractive spreading in very small and large aperture
              VCSELs.  The international team makes a powerful joint theory and experimental
              program that will significantly impact a critical emerging technology sector. 
              The work plan provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the
              international travel and research.
