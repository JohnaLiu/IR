Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will determine the
              feasibility of a process for producing pure hydrogen and electricity at low
              cost from the oxidation of organic wastes. This program will measure oxidation
              and eduction properties of the chemistry, efficiencies of oxidation for model
              organic materials, and effects of other species. This should result in the
              identification of an effective chemistry and establishment of the technical and
              economic feasibility of the proposed process. 
     Commercial application of
              the process will result in lower pure hydrogen costs, increased energy
              efficiency, lower fossil fuel use, pollution prevention, reduced greenhouse gas
              emissions, and a safer environment.
