Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address
              the high cost and size and shape capability of ceramic matrix composites. 
              Silicon carbide (SiC) fiber reinforced silicon carbide composites require
              furnaces, reactors, or ovens to produce the SiC/SiC composite matrix.  These
              reactors, furnaces, and ovens are large capital expenditures limiting product
              size and shape and significantly increasing the cost of composites.  Phase I
              will use an oven-less process to make SiC/SiC composites with a reaction-bonded
              silicon carbide matrix to remove cost, size, and shape constraints on SiC/SiC
              composites.  Phase I will determine the thermal processing parameters required
              to produce SiC/SiC composites comparable to furnace-produced composites. 
              Density, microscopy, and strength will be used to evaluate the process.

This
              is a technology for producing SiC/SiC composites that are not dependent on
              furnace proportions that control the size, shape and cost of the composite
              parts.  Large and complex shapes are expected to be produced rapidly in an
              oven-less process for advanced turbine engines, radiant tube heaters, heat
              exchangers and the numerous erosion, corrosion and thermal applications of the
              chemical, petroleum, and paper and pulp industries.
