Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an
              innovative new ultraviolet (UV) curable pre-ceramic polymer chemistry for the
              fabrication of high yield and low cost silicon oxycarbide (SOC) fibers for
              diesel particulate filters and other applications.  Silicon carbide (SiC),
              silicon nitride (Si3N4), and silicon nitride/silicon carbide (Si3N4/SiC)
              ceramics have been fabricated from UV photocurable pre-ceramic polymers to SiC
              and Si3N4/SiC with higher than 85 percent ceramic yield. Preliminary
              experiments have demonstrated that SOC fibers can also be fabricated from
              high-viscosity, photocurable thermoplastic pre-ceramic polymers.  The
              poly(ethynyl)siloxane pre-ceramic polymers also have potential as a binder or
              matrix phase in SOC/SOC composites.  Phase I will optimize fiber production
              techniques.

Potential commercial applications are expected in particulate
              diesel filters for manufacturers in the automotive and truck markets.
