Abstract    :
              

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              technologies to
automatically generate large meshes appropriate for finite
              element and similar analyses.
This will be done using scalable, parallel
              algorithms that will enable the generation of
meshes on distributed parallel
              computers including workstation clusters. The result of
this project will be
              software that is capable of generating meshes with hundreds of
millions, or
              billions of elements in an efficient manner. The generated meshes will
already
              be partitioned to be compatible with the needs of parallel analysis
              codes.

The commercial applications of this research are in those industries
              that need to perform
large scale simulations of complex problems over general
              domains. The procedures to be
developed will allow simulation based design
              technologies to be applied to applications
that demand massive simulations.
