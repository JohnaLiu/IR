Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a 
              low-temperature, atmospheric-pressure deposition process for metal chalcogenide
              nanomaterials in electronics.  This  process will use a hybrid ink containing
              CdSe nanoparticles mixed with a reactive dispersant in a non-aqueous solvent.
              The reactive dispersant, a metal-organic molecule, will strongly coordinate to
              CdSe nanoparticles to form a suspension at ambient temperatures. During spray
              deposition, this reactive dispersant will thermally transform into CdSe and
              byproducts at relatively low-temperature. As a consequence, this approach will
              allow printed CdSe thin film materials on temperature-sensitive substrates such
              as those of interest in flexible displays.
 
The commercial applications of
              this project include large area flat panel displays, thin film transistor
              fabrication, jet deposition ink formulations and printed electronic materials.
