Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project examines the
              feasibility of using gestural interface technology and interactive robotics to
              facilitate receptive and expressive language development of children with
              severe and/or multiple disabilities.  Developed by AnthroTronix, Inc., the
              technology uses a child friendly robot controlled by various interfaces adapted
              to individual needs, regardless of physical limitations.  The robot imitates
              movements and tells the child's written or spoken stories, providing
              reinforcements and motivation for learning.  Speech and language impairments,
              affecting 10% of school children, including most children with severe
              disabilities, significantly impact abilities to read, write and communicate. 
              Objectives are to examine the technology's (a) applicability across a range of
              disabilities, ages, and interventions in the promotion of speech, language,
              reading, and writing skills, and (b) ease of use by therapists and teachers.  
              Methods will include qualitative data and pre-post tests with 3-5 children
              representing a range of disabilities, cultural backgrounds, and ages who attend
              a K-5 public school.  Results will enable Beta Prototype design specifying a
              range of applications for children with disabilities and  will determine
              specific interventions to be tested in the next phase of the
              research.

Completion of the project will enable the refinement of the
              hardware and software to target specified interventions that promote language
              literacy across a range of children with disabilities.  The technology will be
              marketed in a package that includes a CD-ROM and instructional manual to
              teachers and therapists working with children with disabilities.
