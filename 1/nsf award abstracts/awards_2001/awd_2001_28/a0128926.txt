Abstract    :
              The world's plants consist of homosporous plants, best represented by ferns, and
              heterosporous plants, best represented by seed plants.  Homosporous species
              have high chromosome numbers, suggesting that they are products of repeated
              cycles of doubling of chromosome numbers (polyploidy) followed by gene/genome
              silencing.  This project will address the question of ancient polyploidy by
              generating high resolution genetic maps of the 39 chromosomes of Ceratopteris
              richardii, the fern species used as a model organism for studies of homosporous
              plants.  DNAs from 500 completely inbred hybrid plants (DHLs) will be analyzed
              with approximately 1000 molecular markers.  Analyses of the chromosomal
              locations of duplicate markers will make it possible to determine whether the
              Ceratopteris  species is an ancient polyploid.

Homosporous plants are now
              known to share an immediate common ancestor with seed plants, a group that
              includes all agricultural food plants.  This project's genetic maps will
              provide fundamental information about genomic structure of homosporous plants,
              which in turn will provide basic comparative data bearing on evolutionary
              processes that produced the genomic organization of all of today's plants.  In
              addition to the genetic maps, the 500 fully genotyped DHL plants will be cloned
              and made freely available to biologists for future genetic studies.
