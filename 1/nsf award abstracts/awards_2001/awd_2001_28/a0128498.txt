Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project investigates the
              feasibility and design of a novel authoring and server-client system that
              delivers interactive education-on-demand for technique training and
              telescience.  Rich media including live and archived video, data, and 3-D
              models are (1) collected from instructor sources, (2) objectized and integrated
              into MPEG-4, MPEG-7, and MPEG-21 compliant streams, (3) securely conveyed via
              dynamically selected transport protocols to wide audiences with diverse
              computing platforms (from workstations to wireless PDAs), (4) tailored to
              individual demographics and physical handicap, and (5) rendered in a
              participant-driven interactive fashion that supports user-directed manipulation
              of views and articulation of models, real-time scientific visualization,
              technique learning, real-time analysis of experiment data, and experiment
              control (if authorized) without the need of special hardware.  The client
              admits future media types, and user-supplied extensions (e.g., MatLab
              workspaces) for personalized data analysis, and content is adapted to the
              demographics, physical handicaps, and computing resources of the student.  A
              graphical authoring tool facilitates the set-up of lectures and peer sessions,
              and assessment of student performance and courseware. 
      The concept
              proffered by Sorceron provides technique training and telescience to the
              academic and commercial markets, which require interactivity not available in
              traditional streaming media architectures.  Commercial success is enhanced by
              compliance with emerging multimedia standards and partnering with potential
              clients during technical and business requirements assessment.
