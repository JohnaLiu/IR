Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
              challenge of seamless interoperability among computer systems and user
              interface components such as displays and keyboards. Today these components are
              tightly coupled with the computer, which restricts the utility of
              both-especially in mobile computing systems, where users invariably have to
              choose between usable displays and reasonable portability. A familiar
              manifestation of the opportunity is the "conference display swap" problem. The
              over-all goal of the project is to develop and specify robust, efficient and
              secure interfaces that enable computers to dynamically discover, connect to and
              use displays over moderate-bandwidth network connections. The Phase I
              investigation will focus on efficient encoding techniques for an interoperable
              virtual display interface that can be run over existing wireless network
              technologies. The interface will make it possible for multiple computers to
              share a projection display serially via software. In the longer term, it frees
              mobile computing systems to evolve independently of display technology, and
              leads to a model in which user interface devices are considered public
              infrastructure.

This research has commercial application in a number of
              industries where seamless display sharing is routinely required but is not yet
              supported, such as conference management, higher education, and medicine.
