Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project develops a novel
              method to protect the authenticity of multimedia. The Internet allows cost-free
              distribution of multimedia products of all sorts, from simple documents to
              music, video, or virtual reality. Free product samples become the gravity for
              snowballing success. Yet the same medium is plagued with theft and piracy of
              copyrighted media. The resolution of this dilemma is critical for inventors and
              copyright holders, and indeed for the growth of e-commerce as a whole.
Media
              duplication is critical for exposure as long as the author, artist or company
              is cited. This novel research embeds three markings in multimedia by an
              independent component analysis (ICA) blind mixing algorithm: a visible logo or
              advertisement, an invisible watermark, and an invisible electronic bacteria
              code. The logo serves as a "vaccination" against a dormant digital "electronic
              bacteria" code. Once the logo is removed the bacteria code awakens and degrades
              only the multimedia. The invisible watermark enables retrieval by hardware
              media players and tracking.
The product of this research is twofold:
              intellectual property and software tools. Revenue originates from the sale of
              advertisement space, IP licensing, and sale of software to the content
              producers.
