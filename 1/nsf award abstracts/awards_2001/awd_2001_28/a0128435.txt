Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish
              the performance of the Plasma Flow Source  for stripping and residue cleaning
              of photoresists on 200 mm semiconductor wafers without producing any
              environmentally-damaging waste streams. In particular, it will determine the
              effect of process conditions and gas chemistry on stripping rate and
              uniformity. Measurements will be performed on standard and heavily implanted
              photoresists as well as on patterned wafers following reactive ion etching. 
              The novel Plasma Flow Source system  produces a large flux of oxygen atoms at
              low-temperatures and pressures between 10 and 1000 Torr. It has been shown that
               this source strips photoresists from 100 mm wafers at rates of up to
              0.9micron/min at 120 C and 3.0 micron/min at 250 C, with excellent uniformity.
              The high ash rate observed at 120 C shows promise for removing heavily
              implanted resists and hardened residues from reactive ion etched substrates.
              Moreover, operation at higher pressure reduces gas consumption and dramatically
              decreases pumping requirements. 

The knowledge gained from this study will
              establish the potential of this exciting new technology for
              environmentally-benign, photoresist stripping of wafers for next-generation
              semiconductor devices.
