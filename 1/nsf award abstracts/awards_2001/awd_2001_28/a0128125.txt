Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an
              innovative process for the fabrication of nanometer-scale alloy powders. The
              innovation will result from the combination of state-of-the-art composite wire
              manufacturing techniques with recently developed powder fabrication technology.
              The project will focus on the production of nanometer-scale Nb-Al
              (Niobium-Aluminum) powders for use in the fabrication of improved Nb3Al
              superconducting wire. A Nb-Al composite jelly-roll wire will be fabricated,
              this wire will be converted to nanometer-scale Nb-Al solid solution powder by
              an electro-explosion process, and this powder will be used to fabricate
              monofilament wire by a powder-in-tube process. Samples of the wire will be heat
              treated to form Nb3Al and the resulting superconducting properties will be
              measured. 
     The commercial applications will be in magnets for high energy
              physics and fusion machines, high frequency NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance)
              units, and, potentially, cryo-cooled MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) units.
              This process could be extended to the fabrication of nanometer-scale aluminide
              powders, these materials could be used as in the fabrication of structural
              parts for use in high temperature environments encountered in aerospace
              applications (e.g., turbines), and in the automotive industry (e.g., heat
              treatment furnaces). Nanometer-scale refractory alloy powders could be used to
              coat parts in the corrosive environments found in the chemical industry.
