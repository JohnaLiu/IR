Abstract    :
              The proposed continued affiliation is considered crucial to the mission of the
              Center in at least three ways.  First, the affiliation adds immeasurably to the
              credibility and salability of the Center to prospective members of the U.S.
              Glass industry and the continuation of the present members.  Second it allows
              the NSF to carry out an annual evaluation of the Center (a total quality
              management function).  Third, it permits the Center Directors to participate in
              the national I/UCRC meetings and programs offered by NSF.  Beyond this, of
              course, the additional funding from NSF releives some of the financial burden
              of Center administration from the members and university.
