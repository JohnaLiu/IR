Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes a new
              low cost electro- chemical fabrication method to produce flexible photovoltaic
              cells based on the commercially important copper indium diselenide (CIS) films.
              The project will develop an innovative n-CIS solar cell with fewer components
              and processing steps. The cell will be constructed on a flexible foil to reduce
              weight, fragility and balance-of-system costs. The project also develops a new
              roll-to-roll electrodeposition technology for large volume manufacturing. Phase
              I will synthesize CIS films and construct n/p heterojunction devices on metal
              foils. It will evaluate the solar cell performance to validate the concepts.
              The proposed n-CIS solar cell configuration and its fabrication are specially
              designed to simplify manufacturing, reduce costs and increase production speed.
              It will circumvent the complexity, expense, safety and scale-up issues of the
              present p-CIS technology. Its commercialization will provide a timely solution
              to the nation's escalating energy and environmental problems. It will avert
              future power crises and help reduce global warming.

Applications for the
              copper indium diselenide technology range from the electric utility to
              satellites. Flexible, lightweight, photovoltaic cells may be used in
              non-utility applications such as electric vehicles, building integration,
              mobile systems and new space systems. Lower costs, fewer components and easier
              manufacturing could translate into a wider spectrum of commercial markets.
