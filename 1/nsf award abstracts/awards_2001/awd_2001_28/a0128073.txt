Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will develop a method
              for incorporating Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWNT) into nylon fibers to
              act as reinforcement. This incorporation will be achieved by wrapping the SWNTs
              with a functionalized polymer that both allows the tubes to be dissolved in the
              solution containing the nylon precursors and acts as a load transferring
              conduit between the fiber matrix and the nanotubes in the final composite. The
              primary focus of this project is to optimize the SWNT/nylon matrix interaction
              in order to obtain the best load transfer properties and to direct the
              orientation of the SWNTs along the long axis of the nylon filaments in order to
              maximize the fiber's strength.

The commercial application of this project
              will be in the aerospace industry. The high strength nylon fibers are expected
              to be used to construct flywheel rotors for airplanes and spacecraft that are
              capable of performing the dual functions of high density energy storage and
              control of gimbal and altitude.
