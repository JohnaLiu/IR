Abstract    :
                   This SBIR Phase I project from Learnimation (TM) will produce a
              browser-based assessment and feedback engine prototype that evaluates
              mathematical problem solving skills for students with learning disabilities. 
              This assessment engine prototype will provide adaptive instruction in a
              learning environment designed to meet individual students' needs.  It will also
              provide adaptive guidance to a student's teacher and caregiver.  The importance
              of high level mathematical problem solving and reasoning and the assessment of
              these skills is emphasized for all students by the national standards-governing
              bodies in the United States (NCTM, AAAS, NRC), yet as many as 6% of all school
              age children have severe math deficits with very few tools at their disposal to
              help them gain fluency and measure accountability in an increasingly
              information-based society.
     This investigation will provide an alternative
              assessment platform for mathematics skill development designed specifically for
              learning disabilities and will ensure that all students with disabilities are
              included in the present national educational assessment reforms.
