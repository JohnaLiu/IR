Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the
              Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD) process to modify surface
              properties of particulate matter in a fluidized bed. The proposed Fluidized Bed
              CCVD (FBCCVD) technique will enable production of next generation surface
              engineered powders for applications such as decorative and specialty chemicals.
              In the CCVD process, low-cost, environmentally friendly, metal-bearing reagents
              are dissolved in solvents that serve as a combustible fuel. Using MicroCoating
              Technologies (MCT) innovative atomizer, the Nanomiser TM , this solution is
              atomized to form submicron droplets that are then combusted in a flame to
              produce the desired material. This flame-based method will be integrated with
              an externally recirculating fluidized bed and used to encapsulate particulate
              matter suspended in the fluidized bed with dense and well-adhered thin films.
              The effect of the FBCCVD process variables on the encapsulated powder
              properties, deposition efficiency, and production rate will be investigated.
              

Inexpensive powders with functionalized surfaces are in high demand for
              decorative, optical, specialty chemicals, and electronics applications. The
              powder market is estimated to be over a billion dollar market annually and
              represents a growing segment. Success of the proposed research will result in a
              new FBCCVD process that could facilitate inexpensive production of encapsulated
              powders.
