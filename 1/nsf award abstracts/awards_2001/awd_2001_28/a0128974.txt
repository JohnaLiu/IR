This award supports David Russell, Alexander Neimann and a
              student from the University of Missouri-Saint Louis in a collaboration with
              Lutz Schimansky-Geier of the Department of Physics at the Humboldt University
              in Berlin, Germany.  The aim of the international project is to understand the
              mechanisms of noise-enhanced information encoding in the electrosensory system
              of paddle fish.  The fish represents a naturally designed passive radar system
              with 65 million years of evolution.  Tens of thousands of electrorecptors are
              populated on the elongated rostrum of paddlefish, which acts as a an antenna in
              plankton feeding.  Electrophysiological experiments and the results of previous
              behavioral experiments will provide information for models and parameters of
              the electrosensory system.  The collaboration will combine the theoretical
              modeling of stochastic resonance by the German group and experimental study and
              testing of the theoretical predictions in the US laboratory.  The work plan
              provides for participation by postdoctoral students in the international travel
              and research.
