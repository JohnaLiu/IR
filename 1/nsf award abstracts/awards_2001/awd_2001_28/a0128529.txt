Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project will develop
              technologies to synthesize nano tin/metal oxide anode materials for lithium
              rechargeable batteries. Reducing tin particles to nano size is known to be
              critical for a good cycle life of tin-based anode materials. The materials are
              expected to show a capacity of >1000 mAh/cm3 which represents a >50% increase
              over the practical capacity of carbonaceous materials presently used in lithium
              rechargeable batteries. In addition, the materials are expected to have a first
              cycle reversibility of >80%, comparable to that of carbon.

The commercial
              application of this project will be in the materials market for the next
              generation of lithium rechargeable batteries. The market for portable batteries
              is about $6 billion, with an annual growth rate of 15% in the last 10 years. Of
              this, the worldwide portable lithium-ion battery market is $2.93 billion,
with
              530 million cells shipped in 2000. New markets are also emerging for electric
              and hybrid vehicle propulsion.
