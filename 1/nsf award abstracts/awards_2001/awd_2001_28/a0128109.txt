Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate methods
              for improving the process of requirement definition for software projects. It
              will investigate how the stakeholder in a project can be constrained to create
              only those requirements that have good characteristics. The approach is to
              codify the domain comprised of "all tasks which can be implemented on a
              computer" and present the stakeholder with decisions to make about what will be
              implemented in a specific system. Use cases will be used to facilitate the
              process. After capturing the requirements, an initial object-oriented analysis
              model will be generated automatically from the requirement descriptions. The
              model will be based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML). However, diagram
              notations will define the model in terms of UML metamodels rather than by
              diagram notations. UML modeling tools such as Rational Software's Rose can
              import the metamodels and create their associated graphical representation.
              This research will develop a prototype tool that will guide the stakeholder to
              describe requirements within a fixed format, and automatically create UML
              metamodels.
