Abstract    :
              Soil aggregation (the arrangement of pore spaces and solid matter in soil) is a
              critically important process in natural and managed ecosystems, affecting a
              wide range of soil and ecosystem functions and biota. Management practices and
              erosion threaten soil structure on a national and global scale. Fungi, and in
              particular arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), are of great significance in
              soil aggregation. However, there is little known about of the basic biological
              characteristics of AMF in relation to soil aggregation. This research tests
              several fundamental biological (physiological and architectural)
              characteristics of AMF for their relationship with soil aggregation. It is
              hypothesized that there fungal traits correlate with soil aggregation across a
              number of fungal species. The research also places soil aggregation in the
              context of other functions carried out by these symbiotic fungi, and
              investigates how different species of fungi can interact in maintaining stable
              soil aggregates. An aspect of the educational component of this research is
              participation of graduate students and PI in the Montana Teachers Investigate
              Ecology program, a partnership with Western Montana High School teachers.
