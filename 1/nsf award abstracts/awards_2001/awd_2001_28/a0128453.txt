Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses
              the lack of visualization technology for advanced engineering simulation tools.
              Such tools routinely depend on interpolation and approximation (basis)
              functions for a variety of purposes, including modeling geometry via CAD/CAM
              tools, or for computational techniques such as the finite element method. What
              distinguishes advanced tools from earlier, less sophisticated tools is their
              dependence on higher-order basis functions, as compared to the linear functions
              typical of early tools. While modern simulation tools have moved to more
              sophisticated basis functions, visualization technology has lagged behind.
              Visualization technology, which plays a vital role in understanding,
              communicating and steering computational design, has not moved beyond
              supporting linear basis functions, with a few special exceptions (e.g.,
              quadratic). This situation poses a significant problem for engineering
              computation, since advanced techniques of high accuracy are coupled with
              lower-accuracy display of results. Such an approach is error prone, and
              introduces significant penalties in terms of time and computer resources
              required.
     Kitware, Inc. proffers software technology that will enable
              analysts to use higher-order basis functions for visualization. This technology
              will be available for licensing in the combined CAD/CAM and finite element
              market. In addition, Kitware, Inc. will build visualization applications for
              commercial sale.
