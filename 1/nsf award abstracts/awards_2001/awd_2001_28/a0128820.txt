Abstract    :
              Naturally occurring populations of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) exhibit
              striking genetically based variability in the color patterns of males. Each
              male has a unique color pattern or one that is shared with one or very few
              other fish in the population. How this polymorphism is maintained remains a
              mystery despite decades of study on this model organism. Laboratory studies
              have suggested that the mating success of males may depend on how rare or
              common their color pattern is, and theory suggests that such frequency
              dependent selection could maintain genetic variation. This study will examine
              the role of frequency dependent selection in maintaining color pattern
              variation in naturally occurring guppy populations. It will use new techniques
              for molecular paternity analysis and permanent marking of fish to examine
              patterns of survival and mating success of individual fish in streams.
              

Understanding how genetic variation can persist in natural populations has
              long been a goal of research in evolutionary biology and more empirical study
              is needed. Dwindling populations of organisms often suffer from loss of genetic
              variation. Thus, this is an increasingly important topic for investigation and
              application to conservation strategies. This research involves an international
              collaboration between research and undergraduate institutions, and research
              participation by undergraduates and a high school teacher.
