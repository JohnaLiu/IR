Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an
              innovative and versatile low-pressure injection molding (LPIM) process for the
              fabrication of net-shape ceramic components. LPIM has been recently recognized
              as an attractive process for the fabrication of high-precision,
              complex-geometry ceramic parts. However, one major factor that limits the use
              of injection molding process for production is the lack of reliability and
              throughput. Thus, there is an immediate need for technologies that can
              substantially improve the LPIM process. This project will utilize a
              low-pressure injection molding approach for the net-shape forming of high
              performance ceramics reliably and at low cost. Specific innovations include:
              utilizing an environmentally-safe solvent extraction debinder technique,
              improving the thermal conductivity of the current binder system, and
              demonstrating an improved fabrication versatility that is relatively
              insensitive to material and size constraints.

The commercial benefits will
              be to alumina ceramic based cross-flow particulate filtration systems for
              liquid waste streams; mullite based filters for hot gas streams; NZP based
              engine liners; and alumina based element holders for furnaces.
