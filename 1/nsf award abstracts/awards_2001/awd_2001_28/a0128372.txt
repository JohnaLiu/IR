Abstract    :
              

     This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop
              software tools allowing educators, interpreters, and linguists skilled in
              American Sign Language (ASL), but not skilled in computer 3-D animation, to
              create fully grammatical synthesized ASL to provide access for Deaf and Hard of
              Hearing individuals to Internet web pages and CD-ROM based interactive media;
              and to create interactive courses for learning ASL.  While this project will
              build upon Vcom3D's commercial SigningAvatar(TM) product, a signficant advance
              is proposed.  The current SigningAvatar(TM)technology allows users to generate
              unique sentences in Signed English thus providing partial access to digital
              media.  However, the absence of many elements of ASL grammar limits the use of
              SigningAvatar(TM) by the larger segment of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing
              population who require grammatical ASL for comprehension and for ASL courses.

                  This project addresses the numerous requests to provide fully grammatical
              ASL that Vcom3D has had from the Deaf community.  The resulting ASL products
              will significantly reduce federal costs of public school  education for Deaf
              children and will move toward improving universal access and equity of service
              goals, as mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act;  Section 508 of the
              Rehabilitation Act; and Section 255 of the Telecommunications Act.
