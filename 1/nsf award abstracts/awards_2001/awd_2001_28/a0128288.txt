Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and
              assess electrochemical methods for recovery of the giant and insoluble
              fullerenes that comprise the bulk of the fullerenes made by the hydrocarbon
              combustion route. Of the fullerenes produced by the combustion system at TDA,
              ca. 10 0E 12 % of the raw soot weight is recovered as fullerenes (C60, C70,
              etc.) by washing the soot with o-xylene and filtering. Yet other analyses
              demonstrate that most of the fullerenes are not recovered by straightforward
              washing techniques. In a prior NSF SBIR Phase I, Diener and Alford (Nature 393,
              688) demonstrated an electrochemical method for separation of C74, giant
              fullerenes, and other traditionally insoluble fullerenes from mixed fullerene
              sublimate. This Phase I project is for the expansion of those ideas to
              processing of the extracted soot and implementation on a kilogram or greater
              batch scale.
     The recovered fullerenes will be useful for applications
              demanding a more robust, but still fullerenic material or coating. One
              possibility is carbon coatings for artificial biomaterials, where roughness on
              a nanometer scale promotes cell growth and increases the already high
              biocompatibility of carbon. A thin, robust film of higher fullerenes on steel
              implants potentially offers the high performance of carbon implants, but with a
              fraction of the cost. It is also possible that the small bandgap fullerenes
              could have roles that make use of their postulated three- dimensional
              electrical conductivity, as optical limiters, or as scaffolds for
              nanotechnological devices.
