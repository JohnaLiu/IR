Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              the commercial feasibility of conducting polymer muscle-like actuators as
              active elements in prosthetics, pumps and automatic valves. Rigorous
              characterization has been performed, demonstrating the active stress, strain,
              power to mass and efficiency of actuators in which the active element is a thin
              film of the conducting polymer polypyrrole. Studies show that polypyrrole
              actuators generate up to 100 times the force per cross-sectional area of
              mammalian skeletal muscle, and up to 10 times the work per stroke. Conducting
              polymers convert electrical energy to mechanical work at low applied voltages
              (typically 1 V), and increase in speed as the film thickness is reduced, making
              them ideal for micro and nanoscale applications such as micro-pumping and fluid
              switching. 

The commercial potential will be for polymer driven artificial
              urinary sphincters and low cost automatic irrigation valves. Later applications
              include incorporation into micro and nano-devices.
