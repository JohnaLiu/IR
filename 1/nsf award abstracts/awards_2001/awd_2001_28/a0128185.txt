Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              demonstrate the feasibility of using an agitation device based on a resonating
              elastic member for dispersing and coalescing immiscible liquids. This will have
              a significant impact in the liquid processing for solvent extraction of metals.
              The proposed technology offers a mixing regime that promotes high mass
              transfer, yet easy disengagement between immiscible liquids by forming uniform
              droplet dispersions and creating interfacial activity that increases mass
              transport.  The post-contact phase disengagement can be further enhanced by
              applying higher frequency energy.

The near term commercial application would
              be presented by the changing technological landscape of the international
              mining and metals industries.  The shift to leaching technology has created a
              need for advanced solvent extraction equipment. Applications also exist in the
              pharmaceutical industry, where solvent extraction is an entrenched and accepted
              approach to recovering products from microbial fermentation broths.
