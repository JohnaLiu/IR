Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will determine
              the technical and commercial feasibility of using the rapid freeze prototyping
              (RFP) and jet model making (JMM) processes to produce ice and wax patterns used
              in investment casting to fabricate metal castings for dental restorations. The
              Phase I effort is to develop a solid freeform fabrication based dental
              reconstruction system that can be used by dental labs to produce high-quality
              crowns, bridges, and implant structures rapidly and cost-effectively from
              digital images and computer-aided design data. 

The commercial potential of
              this project will be more precise dental restorations costing less.  In 1999
              this market was estimated to be about $2.5 billion with an expected annual
              growth between 10-15 percent.
