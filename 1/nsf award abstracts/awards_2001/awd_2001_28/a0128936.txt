This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in plant
              genome research involves students and faculty researchers at Iowa State
              University and University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France. Jonathan F. Wendel and
              Malika Ainouche will lead the collaborative program in the US and France
              respectively.  They will study polyploid formation and evolution of novel
              expression patterns in two complementary model systems, one from the cotton
              genus Gossypium and the other from the grass genus Spartina.  Using a diversity
              of materials and natural populations from both genera, gene expression will be
              studied in newly synthesized and older, natural polyploids.  Changes that occur
              immediately after polyploid formation as well as those that arise on an
              evolutionary time-scale will be evaluated.  The researchers will also determine
              the extent and dynamics of gene silencing using a cDNA-AFLP screen to identify,
              sequence and verify. Tissue specific partitioning of expression and novel
              expression in polyploids, compared to their diploid parents, will be examined
              for duplicated genes where initial screens suggest silencing or novel
              expression.  The Iowa State group brings to this collaboration expertise in
              natural and synthetic polyploid members of the cotton genus Gossypium.  French
              studies and investigations of the polyploid system from the grass genus
              Spartina complement this.
 
This award represents the US side of joint
              proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research
              (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses of the US
              investigators and graduate students.  The CNRS will support visits to US of the
              French participants. The collaboration will advance understanding of the
              evolution novel gene expression in higher plants and improvements in cotton
              agriculture.
