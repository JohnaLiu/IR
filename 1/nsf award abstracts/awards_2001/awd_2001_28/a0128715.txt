Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will research technical
              and commercial feasibility of heterogenized homogeneous (supported) palladium
              N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysts.     Homogeneous palladium-catalyzed
              reactions are powerful methods for carbon-carbon and carbon-hetero atom bond
              formations, such as Heck and Suzuki reactions. However, their commercial
              adoption in fine chemical manufacture has been burdened by the inefficiencies
              associated with homogeneous catalysts, primarily recovery and recycling, which
              could be eliminated by the development of supported catalysts.  

Successful
              research and development would result in commercial products that would
              simplify post-reaction processing, reduced waste streams and reduction in costs
              via recycling.
