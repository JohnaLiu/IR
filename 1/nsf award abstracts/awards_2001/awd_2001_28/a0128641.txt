Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project will evaluate the
              technical and economic feasibility of using nanofabricated clay membranes as
              proton exchange membranes (PEMs) in fuel cells. The project team will
              incorporate high cation exchange capacity materials (clays) with polyions as
              thin films and compare them to Nafion, the current material of choice for PEMs.
              Initially, fifty four different nanomembranes will be assembled and evaluated
              against Nafion. The project team will identify those formulations of
              nanomembranes that show the most promise in terms of technical performance and
              economic feasibility.

The fuel cell market has tremendous potential and
              initial estimates forecast growth from $5 to 60 billion between 2005 and 2020.
              Successful research developing nanofabricated clay/polyion membranes for use in
              PEM fuel cell could lower the costs of fuel cell systems by 38% (1 kW system).
              These nanomembranes have the potential to increase the power output of fuel
              cells because they are orders of magnitudes thinner and use high cation
              exchange capacity materials. Furthermore, these nanomembranes are inexpensive
              to make, thus reducing the cost of the overall fuel cell substantially. Not
              only do nanomembranes have the potential to cost less than Nafion, but they can
              also lower the price of fuel cells due to higher operating efficiencies.
