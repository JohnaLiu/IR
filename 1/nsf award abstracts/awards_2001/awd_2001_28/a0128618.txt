Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will produce a
              unique computational tool for heat transport prediction. The novel approach to
              be used here will hybridize the Digital Physics technology based on Lattice
              Boltzmann Methods (LBM) for hydrodynamics with efficient partial differential
              equation (PDE) solution methods for heat transfer using grids of up to a
              hundred million computational cells thus allowing for quantitative prediction
              of heat transfer phenomena of interest in materials processing and
              manufacturing. With this platform, the highest standards of numerical accuracy,
              efficiency (including nearly perfect parallel scalability) and geometrical
              flexibility (including full integration with commercial CAD tools), as well as
              a user friendly interface, shall be naturally inherited. Upon algorithm
              optimization and benchmarking against test flow data, a complex heat transfer
              problem of industrial level complexity shall be simulated. 

The hybrid
              thermal transport prediction tool will open major new commercial markets for
              the PowerFLOW product, especially at the engineering design level. This new
              technology shall enable prediction of internal flow and heat transfer within
              the automotive industry. The ability of the proposed LBM-PDE methods to address
              microscale thermal transport problems in which Knudsen number effects are
              important should open important new markets for novel technologies in MEMS and
              related industries as well as broad new markets for computer aided engineering
              (CAE), especially in manufacturing industries.
