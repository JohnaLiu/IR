Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at
              developing a general platform for conducting combinatorial auctions. It is
              proposed to develop a bidding language and user interface, along with a system
              architecture for an integrated combinatorial auction platform that can be used
              to facilitate combinatorial auctions. The system will provide a wide degree of
              flexibility in terms of the number of rounds, stopping rules, and bidder and/or
              object-specific constraints that can be implemented. If successful, this
              project will lead to a development of a combinatorial auction system that will
              become a standard part of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and will
              greatly enhance electronic procurement in business-to-business environments.
              

Some examples of industries that can benefit from combinatorial auctions
              include: airport time slots for flights; shipping and transportation companies,
              as well as the retailers and manufacturers who use these shippers; computer
              hardware manufacturers, as well as auto manufacturers who can use combinatorial
              auctions for material procurement; and television networks who can use
              combinatorial auctions to sell advertising space in TV shows.
