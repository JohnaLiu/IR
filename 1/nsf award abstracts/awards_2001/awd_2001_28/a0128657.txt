Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will evaluate the
              use of innovative multiclass fluid models for analyzing factory capacity and
              finding optimal scheduling policies for semiconductor fabs. Historically,
              queuing theory models and other analytical tools have not modeled wafer fabs
              well because of their massive size and highly reentrant flows. Recently,
              researchers in modern queuing theory have made considerable progress in
              developing a new type of model known as a multiclass fluid network, which
              addresses many of the shortfalls of earlier analytic methods. The objective of
              this project is improved analytic and computational techniques and tools for
              design, optimization, and simulation of fab operation systems using queuing
              theory and stochastic processes (as models of complex, dynamic fab systems and
              processes) for production planning and control in scheduling wafer processing
              and integrated material logistics (including automated material handling and
              human delivery to and operation of equipment).  The project will show the
              feasibility of several algorithms for solving fluid models when applied to
              realistic fab data in a robust, usable, portable, and scalable computing
              environment. Anticipated results include the development of new software tools
              to improve the performance of manufacturing production systems.

The
              commercial benefits will be to semiconductor manufacturing companies and other
              firms that operate large factories with reentrant flows (such as flat panel and
              disk drive producers). The worldwide semiconductor revenue was over $203
              billion in 2000 (with 914 fabs in current operation), and is projected to be
              nearly $283 billion by 2004 (with an additional 38 fabs on line).
