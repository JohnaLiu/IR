Abstract    :
              EIA-0130705 -University of Washington-Guang R. Gao-Adaptive Neurally-Inspired
              Computing:  Models, Algorithms, and Silicon-Based Architectures

Rapid
              advances in silicon technology over the past few decades have allowed
              digital
devices to achieve ultra-high speeds in numerical computation.
              However, a majority of
these devices are prone to catastrophic failure when
              confronted with circumstances
unforeseen at programming time. Endowing such
              devices with the ability to adapt and
learn from experience is rapidly
              becoming a problem of fundamental importance in
information technology. We
              propose a new approach to solving this problem: building
information
              technology systems based on neurobiological computation and learning.

We
              intend to achieve this goal by developing computational models of plasticity
              and information processing in neurons and networks of neurons in selected
              sensory and motor areas of the brain; testing these models and their
              corresponding algorithms in software-based simulations, and designing real-time
              implementations of these algorithms in silicon using synapse transistors and
              field-programmable learning arrays (FPLAs).

We expect our research to
              provide a better understanding of computation within neuronal
networks, and to
              lead to a new generation of adaptive neuromorphic devices that could be
used
              for a variety of information technology applications, ranging from signal
              processing
and pattern recognition to ubiquitous computing and robotic
              control.
