              Research Resources:  Infrastructure to Develop a Large Scale Experiment Testbed
              of Multi-model Resources

The use of the widely distributed collections of
              structured and unstructured information expressed in multiple languages or
              modalities provided by the Internet, requires production of scalable, robust
              algorithms for the discovery of replicated content, determination of delay or
              access latency of sources, and the confrontation of the inherently dynamic
              nature of the Internet.

This project's objective is to establish a
              laboratory testbed providing a controlled environment that captures structural,
              content, and latency characteristics of the (publicly accessible) Web. This
              will stimulate collaboration between researchers whose interests range over
              natural language applications, language independent processing of scanned
              documents, analysis of video information sources, information retrieval, and
              wide area applications and resource discovery across heterogeneous servers.
              

The testbed will support the development and testing of: (1) tools for
              broad-scale, cross-linguistic analysis and discovery of relevant information
              across languages and modalities, (2) cost models and access cost catalogs for
              wide area environments, reflecting the temporal variability in access latency,
              (3) distributed content based indexing and association of media clips for
              resource discovery, (4) transcoding and scheduling of multimedia resources for
              delivery any time and anywhere to disparate clients; from mobile wireless to
              high speed optical links.
