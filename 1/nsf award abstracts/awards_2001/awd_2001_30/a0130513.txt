Abstract    :
              As we approach 100nm technology, the impact of interconnect on signal integrity
              is becoming one of the main concerns in testing gigahertz system-on-chips
              (SoCs). Voltage distortion (noise) and delay violations (skew) contribute to
              signal integrity loss and ultimately functional error, performance degradation,
              shorter life and reliability problems. This research investigates a methodology
              to model and test signal integrity in deep-submicron high-speed interconnects
              that bind the internal cores in a SoC. The following issues are being explored:
              a) the development of a unified integrity fault model, independent of
              technology, that includes various problems occurring on the SoC's high-speed
              interconnects such as crosstalk, overshoot, skew, etc.; b) the establishment of
              a test generation technique that finds test patterns to stimulate maximal
              (worst case) integrity loss on the interconnect network; c) the implementation
              of noise detector (ND) and skew detector (SD) cells, to detect noise and skew
              violations (integrity loss) over a period of operation; and d) the design of a
              cost- and time-efficient readout architecture to transfer the integrity
              information that ND and SD cells accumulate. As part of educational plan, we
              are: 1) developing a two course sequence on ASIC/SoC design and test with
              emphasis on high-frequency issues; 2) involving undergraduate students in
              general, and minorities in particular, in VLSI/ASIC/SOC test research. 3)
              advocating for greater CAD tool use in early stage of CE/EE curriculum.
