Abstract    :
              This action is to support a post-earthquake field survey of the magnitude Mw 8.1
              earthquake that occurred on June 23, 2001 near the coast of southern Peru,
              about 175 km west of Arequipa or 595 km southeast of Lima.  This earthquake
              caused extensive damage in the areas around the cities of Arequipa, Camana,
              Moquegua, and Tacna; part of the damage has been attributed to a tsunami wave
              in the Camana area.

The goal of this geotechnical reconnaissance team is to
              document the geotechnical and engineering geology/seismology features of this
              earthquake.  The team is being coordinated by Adrian Rodriguez-Marek of
              Washington State University and Pedro Repetto of URS Corporation, with
              collaboration of Joseph Wartman, Drexel University.  Jorge Zegarra of the
              Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru is serving as the local contact and is
              assembling a team of local experts to participate in this reconnaissance
              effort.

It is expected that this reconnaissance will yield information and
              data which will help the profession understand the effects of interplate
              subduction earthquakes on the built environment.  These efforts will support
              the continuing efforts to reduce the earthquake risk posed by the
              Aleutian-Alaskan and Cascadia subduction zones in the United States.  The
              results of the earthquake reconnaissance will be made available in two phases. 
              In the first phase, the early reconnaissance reports will be posted on the
              Internet through the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER) web
              page at <http://peer.berkeley.edu>.  The release of the report will be
              announced using the GEOTECH Internet mailing list.  In the second phase, a more
              comprehensive final report will be prepared; it will be available as a hardcopy
              report or as an Adobe Acrobat file downloadable from the Internet.
