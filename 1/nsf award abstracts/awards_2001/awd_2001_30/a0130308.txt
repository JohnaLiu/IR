Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Columbia University will upgrade
              a 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will facilitate research in the
              following areas:  a) microscale determinations of structures, stereochemistry
              or ligand/receptor interactions using nano- to micro-gram amounts of ligands;
              b) studies of helical conjugated molecules; c) development of a genetic screen
              for proteins in vivo based on catalytic activity; d) de novo protein design;
              and e) synthesis of molecules with interesting properties, such as a catalyst
              that selectively binds and hydrolyzes cocaine in vivo.   

Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists
              for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify
              unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
              solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
              studies will have an impact in a number of areas including biochemistry and
              synthetic chemistry.
