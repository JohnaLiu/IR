Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at SUNY Albany will acquire an X-ray
              diffractometer with CCD detector for small molecule diffractometry. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas: a) investigations of
              catalyst systems for efficient syndiotactic polymerization of styrene (Welch);
              b) studies on the calcium affinity of coordinated polyphosphonates (Dikarev);
              c) synthesis and study of acyclic and heterocyclic organic compounds of sulfur,
              selenium and silicon, including natural products from garlic, onions, and
              mushrooms, and the use of sulfur compounds in organic synthesis and as ligands
              (Block); d) design of novel supramolecular materials (Petrukhina); e)
              structural studies on the folding and unfolding of small globular proteins
              (Scholesz); and f) synthesis, structural characterization and physicochemical
              evaluation of metal complexes containing silylated and germylated
              beta-diketonates and related ancillary ligands (Toscano).

The X-ray
              diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three
              dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and
              it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
              relative to the neighboring molecules.  The diverse research programs that will
              benefit from this diffractometer include those in inorganic, organometallic,
              organic, materials, biophysical and bioorganic chemistry.
