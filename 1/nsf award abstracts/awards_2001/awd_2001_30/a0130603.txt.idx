Abstract    :
              This project will support a conference on research on learning technologies and
              technology-supported education in Tampa/St. Pete on May 4-6, 2002 and will
              support the participation of US researchers at a related Tuebingen conference
              to be held in  Germany in October 2001.  The conference is organized to pair
              senior researchers with early career researchers on actual research projects
              that will be discussed and refined at the two conferences.  The work of the
              Tampa conference in 2002 will be a direct extension of the work completed at
              the Tuebingen conference.  The research will result in papers published in two
              special issues of the International Journal of Educational Policy, Research,
              and Practice.
