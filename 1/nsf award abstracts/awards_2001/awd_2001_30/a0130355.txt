This research by an anthropologist from the University of
              Michigan will examine the impact of Islamic education on the perspectives and
              practices of women in Northern Nigeria. This demographic anthropological study
              of married Hausa Muslim women's participation in Islamic adult education
              programs in the town of Zaria, Nigeria, will report on women's perceptions of
              moral conduct in social relations, and will examine women's views of what they
              have gained-intellectually, socially, morally and economically-from their
              attendance at Islamic education classes.  The project will compare the moral
              views, social and economic preferences, and aspirations for daughters of
              schooled and non-schooled women through a survey of 540 women. The role of
              women's education in affecting changes in marital age and health is important
              to understand, as prior research shows that a mother's increased education is
              one of the best predictors of gains in maternal and child health.  This
              project's focus on Islamic, as opposed to Western education, has wider
              implications as it will advance our understanding of this relationship in a
              different educational regime.
