This award supports the participation of American
              scientists in a U.S.-Japan seminar on resonances in small systems to be held in
              Saitama, Japan from July 22-24, 2002.  The co-organizers are Professor Ilya
              Fabrikant at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln and Professor Mineo Kimura of
              Yamaguchi University in Japan.  Collision processes in different environments
              are often driven by intermediate resonance states.  They play an important role
              in a broad variety of scientific fields: atomic physics, nuclear physics,
              surface and condensed matter physics, chemistry, and biological sciences.  Even
              in complex processes involving many particles it is often possible to extract
              few-body resonance effects responsible for observed phenomena.  On the other
              hand, each field of science has its own method in treating these effects. 
              Therefore, it is important for specialists in each particular field to get
              together and discuss their own findings and problems, to exchange ideas and to
              learn about the methods used in other fields.

It is expected that the
              seminar will provide a good opportunity for closer interactions between
              electron scattering and positron scattering groups, surface and atomic physics
              groups and interaction between other branches of science.  The project advances
              international human resources through the participation of many junior faculty,
              postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate students. Through the exchange of
              ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and
              promote international understanding and cooperation. The researchers plan to
              publish proceedings of the seminar in the Plenum Press.
