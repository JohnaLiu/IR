The objective of this research is to investigate the use of a
              new approach to the modeling of groundwater flow and transport systems.  A
              Monte-Carlo simulation approach is the only viable method for the solution of
              such problems involving large uncertainties in parameter values, such as
              hydraulic conductivity; but current methods require enormous computational
              effort and they require the use of rectangular numerical meshes.  The goal of
              this research is to explore a new approach to generating random fields for both
              parameters and state variables that results in significantly less computational
              effort when simulating groundwater flow and transport and that can also be used
              on a triangular (or other irregular) finite-element mesh.  The approach uses a
              variant on Latin-hypercube sampling to perform the necessary Monte-Carlo
              simulations.  The overall goal is to increase both computational speed and
              mathematical flexibility when solving such problems described using parameters
              characterized by random fields.  The computational efficiency will be achieved
              by reducing the number of realizations required to represent a random field to
              a specified degree of accuracy.  The mathematical modeling flexibility will be
              enhanced by extending current random field representation technology to
              accommodate irregular finite-element simulation meshes, a technology that does
              not currently exist.   This project could lead to significant gains in
              efficiency and effectiveness in solving difficult problems of groundwater
              contamination and flow, as well as a wide range of other problems in
              engineering and physics.
