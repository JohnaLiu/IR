              Resources:  Resources for Research in Scalable Parallel Computing and
              Networking Simulation  The PIs seek to acquire a network of six 4-cpu
              multiprocessors and a data storage system connected with 100 Mbit/s Ethernet. 
              This equipment will be used for building scalable parallel and distributed
              systems for tabled logic programming (LP), for computational geometry projects,
              as well as for quantitatively studying mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs).  The
              logic programming project seeks to combine dynamic reordering of alternatives
              with stack-splitting for realizing or-parallel tabled LP systems on distributed
              networks of SMPs. The computational geometry projects are related to research
              on design and implementation of scalable parallel and distributed algorithms
              for the weighted regions optimal trajectory problem, with applications in
              surgery planning, geographic information systems, and radiation therapy. The
              parallel implementations will be carried out on the network of SMPs.  The MANET
              project will conduct a quantitative evaluation of unidirectional wireless links
              in MANETs: the impact of interference and battery life on the occurrence of
              unidirectional links, and MAC sub-layer issues for such links. Routing
              protocols designed to use both bidirectional and unidirectional links will be
              evaluated via simulations.  The network of multiprocessors and the data storage
              system will be used, respectively, for conducting large simulations and for
              storing large simulation data.
