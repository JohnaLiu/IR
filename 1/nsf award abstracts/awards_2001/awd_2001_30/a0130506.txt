Abstract    :
              The proposed project is to develop a method to directly measure the
              nanometer-scale fluid velocity in order to characterize the flow field in the
              vicinity of cell-surface mechanoreceptors.  The method is based on use of the
              atomic force microscopy (AFM) to access the small scale regions on the cell
              surface.  The AFM cantilever tip is modified by placing nanocarbon bundles with
              a single nanocarbon tube protruding into the flow field.  The force on the
              nanocarbon tube will be correlated to the flow filed to extract the flow
              velocity information.
