Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT  The Alaska Native Science Commission will conduct a workshop on
              "Ethical Practices for Documenting Alaska Native Cultures" in Anchorage,
              October 2001.  The workshop will include Alaska Native tradition bearers and
              researchers who will discuss their experiences working on collaborative
              cultural documentation projects.  Panelists will address the topics of
              intellectual property, the nature of local knowledge, and the ethics of
              collaborative research.  The workshop will allow others to learn from Alaska
              Natives' experiences with collaborative research projects.
