Abstract    :
              EIA-0130108 Lloyd M. Smith University of Wisconsin-Madison  Title:
              Multiple-Word CNA Computing on Surfaces  Under this project tools are being
              developed to increase the computational generality of surface-based DNA
              computing. It is well known that for a computing model to be general, that is,
              capable of efficiently simulating algorithms used in conventional electronic
              computing, it must be able to efficiently simulate circuits. It has been shown
              theoretically that the surface-based approach, when using multiple words and
              the MARK, DESTROY-UNMARKED, UNMARK, and APPEND operations, is a generalizable
              approach to computing, but this has not been implemented experimentally.  The
              necessary tools for such an implementation is being developed.   Particular
              tasks, which are being addressed to this end, include:  -improved designs of
              sets of DNA "words" that do not interfere with one another in hybridization
              experiments and do not contain strong secondary structure motifs.  -methods
              for the efficient purification of colloidal gold nanoparticles and the
              implementation of surface-based DNA computing using such particles as supports.
                -development of a new DESTROY-UNMARKED operation, multiple-word AND
              operation, and multiple-word APPEND-MARKED operation.
