This project will
              construct a state-of-art immersive display at the University of Virginia. 
              Specifically, the investigators will build a wide field-of-view tiled display,
              using passive stereo projection, 6-DOF head tracking, and spatialized audio to
              create an extremely immersive 3-D audio-visual display environment.  This
              display will benefit and enable three separate research projects in the
              Computer Science and Psychology departments: gaze-directed rendering,
              perceptually driven physical simulation and animation, and cognitive design of
              human-computer interfaces.  Tiling multiple projectors will create a display
              spanning a very wide field of view; two projectors per tile will enable passive
              stereo display with lightweight polarizing glasses.  An audio system, a head
              tracker, and realistic scanned 3-D environments will enable immersive and
              convincing virtual worlds.  The wide field-of-view will provide an ideal
              testbed for gaze-directed rendering, which accelerates interactive rendering by
              exploiting reduced visual acuity (e.g., for peripheral or fast-moving objects),
              and for perceptually driven physical simulation, which selectively degrades
              simulation accuracy according to perceptual metrics.  The human-computer
              interface project investigates immersive ambient context to improve human
              memory.  The stereo head-tracked capabilities of the new display will literally
              add a new dimension to the investigation, enabling full 3-D environmental
              cues.
