We propose to develop efficient, evolutionary design strategies for
              constructing functional de novo genetic
circuits. We will apply methods of
              molecular evolution, which have proven highly successful for
engineering
              proteins with improved or altered properties, to complex genetic systems
              involving multiple
repressors, operators, and promoters. We believe that
              evolution will prove to be generally applicable for
optimizing individual
              devices as well as complex genetic circuits, and our goal will be to
              demonstrate
how evolutionary searches are best performed in order to build
              libraries of devices and assemble them
into functional circuits.

We
              anticipate that this research will establish a general strategy for de novo
              genetic circuit design
and provide new insight into the natural algorithms of
              information processing in biological systems and
biological complexity. This
              research exploits, in powerful combination, the strengths of
              classical
approaches in electrical circuit design (characterizing the device
              physics of gates, then composing
circuits from well understood components)
              with adaptation mechanisms (mutation and selection)that are
the hallmark of
              biological systems.
