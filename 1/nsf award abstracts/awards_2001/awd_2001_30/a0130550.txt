Abstract    :
              This proposal will bring together three specific, recent advances to study the
              behavior of hybrid systems, most notably those systems for which the
              traditional algorithmic methods fail because the reachability and
              omega-language problems are undecidable.  The tools that will be used
              include:

1. The recent development of  a model for the probabilistic process
              algebra PCSP in which the expected laws for both nondeterministic choice and
              for probabilistic choice operators hold,
2. The recent development of a
              quantified m-calculus and associated quantified temporal logic for reasoning
              about finite state systems that support both nondeterministic choice and
              probabilistic choice, and
3. Recent results about the expressibility of simple
              measures on locally compact spaces - in particular, the fact that any
              probability measure on such a space is the directed supremum of  simple
              measures.

These results tie together to provide an interesting and novel
              approach to modeling hybrid systems.
