Abstract    :
              EIA 0130900-Michael Arbib-Biological Information Technology Systems-BITS: Neural
              Computing, Round 3  

There have been two main rounds of neural computing to
              date, the first focusing on adaptation and self-organization, the second on
              compartmental modeling of the neuron.  This project will catalyze a third round
              of neural computing:  Analyzing the architecture of the primate brain to
              extract neural information processing principles and translate them into
              biologically-inspired operating systems and computer architectures.  This
              project will focus on analyzing and further developing computational
              neuroscience models concerned with grasping, recognizing and executing actions,
              and describing those actions with language, in terms of basic information
              processing principles.  The intention is to create a new research effort,
              applying the latest advances in computational neurobiology to the design of a
              new generation of machines.  In particular, the proposed research will catalyze
              research and development of unusually robust, versatile, and adaptive computer
              architectures, that can easily adapt, correct themselves, and blend diverse
              styles of processing.
