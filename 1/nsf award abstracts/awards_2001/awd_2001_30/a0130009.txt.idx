Abstract    :
              This project provides for development of a long-term research plan that will
              identify the needs and opportunities that exist to advance the state of the art
              and the state of the practice in earthquake engineering and earthquake loss
              reduction.    The Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) will
              convene intensive panel activities to be comprehensive in nature and to advance
              knowledge in the following areas:  improve understanding of physical models,
              improve the treatment of uncertainty in analysis and simulations, contribute to
              the development of a protocol for systematic performance data, improve
              understanding of societal impacts, and contribute to better integration of
              research and education.  The plan will incorporate opportunities presented by
              high performance computing, information systems, simulation and visualization
              and will work closely with other organizations and programs including the
              Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS), the NSF-funded earthquake engineering
              research centers (EERCs), and the agencies and organizations that make up the
              National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program.  EERI will establish a panel
              of researchers and professionals from the earth sciences, structural and
              geotechnical engineering, the social and policy sciences, architecture and
              urban planning, and information technology.  Over a nine-month period, the
              panel members will commission a series of white papers that provide a summary
              of expert assessment of research needs in each field.  The panel will engage in
              teleconferences to gain further input and will draw on the white papers to
              prepare the comprehensive plan.
