Abstract    :
              This work will begin to map brain circuits that carry the reward signal believed
              to be generated when animals successfully meet motivational goals, such as
              finding food when hungry.  Such a signal is thought to inform the animal that
              its current behavior is important to its survival, and to reinforce the
              continuation of that behavior.  Electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain
              bundle has long been believed to create a potent and non-satiating version of
              the reward signal, yet the circuitry traversed by this signal outside of this
              major axon pathway is still unknown.  Brain areas critical to carrying the
              signal will be revealed by psychophysically tracking changes in the reward
              magnitude of medial forebrain bundle stimulation when target areas distant from
              the bundle are temporarily anesthetized.  Once reward-relevant targets are
              identified, the anatomical relationship of these targets to the stimulation
              sites will be explored electrophysiologically. The stimulation-induced neural
              activity wilkl be followed to those areas to see whether the neural signals
              have conduction properties known to characterize the putative reward signal,
              and whether the target areas are directly or indirectly (i.e.,
              transynaptically) linked to the medial forebrain bundle. This project will
              increase our understanding of brain circuits involved in reward, with a long
              term goal of understanding their role in consumptive and other motivated
              behaviors.
