Abstract    :
              Large-eddy simulation (LES) is increasingly used to analyze land-atmosphere
              interactions at scales relevant to microscale and mesoscale meteorology.  The
              goal of this project is to improve the understanding of subgrid-scale (SGS)
              motions - the turbulent velocity fluctuations too small to be resolved in LES
              models, which must be accounted for by some kind of parameterization.  The
              approach is to use experimental data collected in the SGS2000 experiment,
              conducted in the summer of 2000 in the San Joaquin Valley.  The analysis will
              employ novel ideas that have arisen from laboratory studies of turbulence. 
              These include new statistical-geometrical tools to quantify alignments between
              SGS heat flux and temperature gradient vectors, the evaluation of spectral eddy
              viscosities and eddy diffusivities from the data, and the study of coherent
              structures such as sweeps and ejections.  To extend the range of the scales
              that can be analyzed, a new field experiment will be planned that combines an
              array of hot-wire anemometers to measure the fine scales of turbulence with
              arrays of sonic anemometers to measure the larger scales.  Details of the
              experiment design will depend on the outcome of the analysis of SGS2000 data. 
              The field program will be undertaken in collaboration with the Atmospheric
              Technology and the Microscale and Mesoscale Meteorology Divisions of the
              National Center for Atmospheric Research.
