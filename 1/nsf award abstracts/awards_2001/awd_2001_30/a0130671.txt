Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Czech research project between David Galbraith of the University of
              Arizona and his counterpart, Jaroslav Dolezel from the Czech Academy of
              Sciences' Institute of Experimental Botany in Olomouc, features use of
              flowsorting to selectively enrich populations of individual barley chromosomes.
              Their intent is to produce fluorescent genomic DNA targets for hybridization of
              barley DNA microarrays and for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)
              analyses of metaphase chromosomes. The total effort benefits from the Arizona
              team's extensive expertise with microarray technologies and the Czech's
              expertise in both fluorescence-activated sorting of plant chromosomes and plant
              chromosome cytology. Research experiences for undergraduate students are an
              integral part of the research plan.  If successful, this work my yield new
              techniques for mapping single copy genes (i.e. ESTs) on specific plant
              chromosomes using barley as a model. The researchers also anticipate using the
              sorted chromosomes for the production of chromosome-specific DNA libraries.
              

This international project in plant genome research fulfills the program
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the Untied
              States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research
              resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
