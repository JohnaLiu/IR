Abstract    :
              EIA-0130391 Gerald J. Sussman Massachusetts Institue of Technology  Title:
              Robust Engineering Using Biologically-inspired Models of Cell Differentiation
              and Morphogenesis  This research focuses on morphogenesis and developmental
              biology as an inspiration for algorithms and general principles for organizing
              complex behavior from locally interacting agents. The goal is to design
              artificial systems that replicate biological robustness, and to use insights
              from these systems to understand the capabilities of biological systems. The
              general principles are formalized as programming languages --- with explicit
              primitives, means of combination, and means of abstraction --- thus providing a
              framework or the design and analysis of self-assembling systems. Previous work
              demonstrated this approach with a programming language that specifies a robust
              process for shape formation on a sheet of identically-programmed ``cells''
              using local primitives from epithelial cell morphogenesis and Drosophila cell
              differentiation, and rules from geometry.  The specific aims are: 1) developing
              new programming models for domains such as growth and apoptosis (cell death)
              and 2) investigating the connection of current programming models to biological
              processes. This research will have significant impact on both the engineering
              principles for robust design and on the understanding of biological
              morphogenesis.
