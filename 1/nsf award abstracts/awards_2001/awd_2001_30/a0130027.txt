Lay Abstract

This project explores the
              feasibility of genetic studies of avian choice behavior.  The project has two
              key goals.  First, it will develop a system for testing the choice behavior of
              Coturnix quail that will allow the investigators to efficiently assay several
              aspects of choice behavior, such as how quickly food preferences develop, and
              how sensitive preferences are to differences in the timing and amount of food
              reward.  The second goal of this project is to make preliminary estimates of
              the heritability of, and correlations between preference traits.  These
              estimates will be made by comparing the measured "preference traits" of related
              individuals.  In this study we will test half-sib families, that is, family
              groups in which a given pair of quail has the same father, but different
              mothers.  This method allows us to exclude possible maternal effects.  The
              resulting genetic estimates will allow us to make predictions about how  choice
              behavior should respond to natural or artificial selection.  Genetic
              correlations between traits provide information about the extent to which the
              different aspects of choice behavior are influenced by the same genes.
