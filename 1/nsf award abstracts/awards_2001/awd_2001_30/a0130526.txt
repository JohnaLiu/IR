ABSTRACT

The
              Berkeley Statistics Department will operate a vertically integrated research
              and education program involving undergraduate majors, graduate students,
              postdoctoral fellows, and faculty.

The goal of the program is to produce
              statistically trained professionals who will contribute to our society in the
              commercial, governmental, and academic sectors. The program contains several
              integrated components. Innovations at the undergraduate level include
              curriculum reform, research seminars, and research experiences for
              undergraduates.  The graduate student component includes education, mentored
              teaching experiences, research, and broadening components aimed at training
              graduate students to interact in interdisciplinary environments.  The
              postdoctoral component includes mentored research and teaching experiences.
              Recruitment of traditionally under-represented groups into these programs will
              be strengthened by the resources of the Berkeley Edge, a campus NSF-Alliance
              for Graduate Education and the Professoriate, the goal of which is to triple
              minority Ph.D. production in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering.
