Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Northern
              Illinois University will acquire a liquid chromatograph - ion trap mass
              spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including a) characterization of heme protein samples; b) photochemical studies
              of autofluorescent pigments; c) development of new analytical tools based on
              protein-ligand interactions; d) studies of carboranes and metallacarboranes; e)
              investigations of reaction rates and thermodynamics for ions in the gas phase;
              and f) the development of reusable ruthenium carbene catalysts for olefin
              metathesis.  

Liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection
              (LC-MS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation and analysis
              of complex mixtures.  This instrument will substantially strengthen scientific
              research in a wide variety of projects, ranging from the measurement of
              physical properties of ions to biochemical structural analysis.
