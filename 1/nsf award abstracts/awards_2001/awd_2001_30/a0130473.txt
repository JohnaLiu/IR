Abstract    :
              15 years ago, Fitchen (1997) posed the question, "Why do we continue to tolerate
              hunger amidst the affluence of the United States?"  She hypothesized that
              Americans expect the poor to eat marginally-the rich shall eat steak and the
              poor shall have cheese.  Although the prevalence of food insecurity and hunger
              in the general population has fallen, high rates continue among
              African-Americans and Hispanics. What is the social and cultural context in
              which minority households experience food insecurity in the US?  In Durham
              County, NC, this doctoral student will investigate the relationship between
              structural, community, and household factors that contribute to food security. 
              She proposes to develop a theoretical model of food security based on the
              perspectives of African-American and Hispanic families living in urban and
              rural neighborhoods.  Using food access indicators developed through GIS to
              identify 8 case study neighborhoods, she will use qualitative and participatory
              research methods to conduct key informant interviews and focus group
              interviews.  Participants will document their own sources of household food
              security, the role that food assistance plays in their household food security,
              and the relationship of food access to food assistance and household food
              security.  The results from this study will provide important insights into the
              determinants of household food security beyond and within the household.
