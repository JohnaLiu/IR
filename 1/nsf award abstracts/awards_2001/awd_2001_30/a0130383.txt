Title: Quantum
              Computing with Superconducting Qubits

This project is exploring quantum
              computing based on superconducting Josephson quantum bits (or qubits) coupled
              through microwave fields. More specifically, the quantum dynamics of a
              Cooper-pair box with a superconducting loop, as well as the flux-based qubit,
              in the presence of either classical or non-classical microwave fields are being
              investigated.

The control of quantum coherent Rabi oscillations in a
              superposition of two charge states, for both single-and multi-photon processes
              are being studied.  Under this project very novel quantum computing schemes for
              Josephson qubits coupled through photons, including the implementation of
              quantum communications between qubits is being investigated.  The local gate
              voltages and a microwave field can be used to control the device, which should
              be scalable to at least 10^8 qubits. Thus ways to implement scalable and
              well-controlled quantum computers, which are expected to be capable of
              performing certain tasks which no classical computers can do in practical time
              scales are being investigated.  Indeed, the Cooper pair box is a viable
              candidate for the implementation of quantum gates since it is a macroscopic
              two-level system that can be coherently controlled. Finally, young researchers
              are being trained in the fast growing area of quantum computing.
