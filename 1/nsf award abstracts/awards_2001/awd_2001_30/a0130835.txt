Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oklahoma - Norman
              will acquire a X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector for small molecule
              diffractometry. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including the following: a) studies of nitrosyl and nitroso metalloporphyrins;
              b) the synthesis and characterization of group 13 organometallic compounds; c)
              the reactivity and synthetic utility of organotransition metal complexes; d)
              fast ion transport in solids; and e) synthetic bioinorganic chemistry.

The
              X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three
              dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and
              it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
              relative to the neighboring molecules.  These studies will have an impact in a
              number of areas, including the preparation of more efficient catalysts and
              biochemistry.  In addition, this CCD-equipped single crystal diffractometer
              will be the first instrument of its kind to be available in the state of
              Oklahoma, and will be used as a state resource for serving the needs of nearby
              institutions including several small regional colleges.
