Abstract    :
              EIA-0130385 Russell J. Deaton University of Arkansas  Title: Modeling and
              Manufacture of Huge DNA Oligonucleotide Libraries for Computation  Computing
              with DNA, with its advantages of massive parallelism and huge information
              density, promises a number of revolutionary applications, as well as the
              potential to solve problems beyond the capabilities of conventional computers.
              A critical barrier, however, is unplanned crosshybridization among
              oligonucleotides. In order for the computations to be reliable and efficient,
              and to scale to larger problems, the DNA sequences have to be designed to
              minimize these unplanned crosshybridizations. Though pairwise hybridization is
              well modeled and understood, design of such libraries is challenging because of
              the huge number of pairwise hybridization's, and the conflicting constraints of
              maximizing the library size while minimizing crosshybridization.Therefore, to
              overcome these limitations, huge libraries of non-crosshybridizing DNA
              oligonucleotides  are manufactured by in vitro evolution with a PCR-based
              protocol that selects from a random pool those oligonucleotides that are
              maximally mismatched. In addition, because enumeration of all pairwise
              hybridization energetic in a huge library is computationally prohibitive, a
              statistical approach, which is based upon spin glass physics, is used to model
              the library. The model is the basis for a set of analysis and design tools for
              application to the libraries.  Because of the fundamental importance of DNA
              hybridization in DNA computing, the modeling and manufacture of huge libraries
              of DNA oligonucleotides is producing foundational principles and results for
              the field. The size of the largest libraries of non-crosshybridizing
              oligonucleotides is also the limit on the size of feasible computation. The
              libraries are an enabling resource not only for large-scale DNA computations,
              but also biotechnology applications, such as reusable, universal DNA
              microarrays. In addition, the libraries, as well as the software tools, are
              available for reproduction and use by other researchers in DNA computing and
              biotechnology.
