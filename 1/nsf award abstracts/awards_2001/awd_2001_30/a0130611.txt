Abstract    :
              This project involves participation in the International H20 Project (IHOP)
              field program.  The IHOP is a large multi-agency, multi-investigator project
              that focuses on the measurement of water vapor and water vapor variability. 
              The goal of this project is to improve understanding of convective initiation,
              increase short-term precipitation forecast skills and test the capabilities of
              various instruments to measure the four dimensional characteristics of water
              vapor.  

The Principal Investigator will utilize an advanced instrument
              known as the Mobile Integrated Profiling System (MIPS) as part of an extensive
              ensemble of mobile ground-based instrumentation.  The MIPS capabilities include
              vertical profile measurements of wind, vertical motion, temperature, virtual
              temperature, cloud properties, boundary layer characteristics, and water vapor.
               The principal objectives of the Principal Investigator are to advance
              understanding of convective initiation and its dependence on characteristics of
              boundaries and the adjacent atmospheric boundary layer.  In addition to
              participating in experiments on convective initiation, the Principal
              Investigator also will use the MIPS to collect data important to the success of
              other IHOP researchers.  Finally, the Principal Investigator will conduct
              thorough comparisons of the MIPS 12-channel passive microwave profiling
              radiometer with other remote sensing devices and in situ soundings.
