              Research Resources:  Experimental Testbed for Mobile Network Protocols

The
              overall objective of this project is to experimentally analyze mobile network
              protocols that support multimedia services.  A wireless, mobile multimedia
              network will be built to add an experimental component to four ongoing research
              projects at UNC Charlotte.  The experimental work will focus on the component
              of each project that involves development and analysis of mobile network
              protocols.  Experimentation will enable critical analysis of protocol behavior
              in dynamic environments where real-world entities replace simulation models,
              especially, network traffic models, wireless channel models, fault and
              vulnerability models, and power usage models.  The testbed will encompass both
              cellular and ad hoc network architectures with components that include PCs and
              laptops with IEEE 802.11 radios and FreeBSD operating system.  Network nodes to
              be configured include multimedia nodes that generate variable bit rate
              streaming audio and video and a security authentication node.  The testbed will
              support individual research activities as well as facilitate synergy among the
              researchers who possess expertise in the areas of multimedia, security, ad hoc
              networking, and cellular networking.  The outcome of the experimental studies
              will contribute to the limited body of knowledge of mobile network protocol
              behavior within highly dynamic environments.
