Abstract    :
              The Design and Development of a Network Process Migration System

Intensive
              research has been done in process migration and mobility. However, most present
              successes are
based on safe-languages such as Java. While this safe-language
              approach provides a satisfactory solution for many applications, it has
              inherent limitations, especially for technical computing applications. During
              the last few years, the Principle Investigator (PI) and his research group have
              developed a set of methodologies to support heterogeneous process migration for
              high performance computing. This has included a practical
              data-collection-restoration methodology applicable to codes written in legacy
              languages such as C or Fortran, an effective data representation and transfer
              scheme for heterogeneous network environments, and a feasible
communication
              protocol for process coordination in a migration-supported dynamic environment.
              In this research, the PI proposes to further test these existing methodologies,
              develop a methodology for I/O state
transfer, and explore the design of an
              integrated network process migration system to support process migration of
              legacy codes written in stack-based languages such as C, Fortran, or C++ in a
              heterogeneous 
network environment.
