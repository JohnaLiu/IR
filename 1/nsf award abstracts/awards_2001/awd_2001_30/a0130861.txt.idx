Abstract    :
              0130861    Srinivas Aluru Iowa Stae University  CISE Research Resources: 
              Acquisition of a Cluster for Experimental Parallel Computing Research in
              Scientific Computing and Computational Biology  This project provides funding
              to Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Iowa State University
              for acquisition of a cluster of 64 Pentium workstations connected by a
              high-speed network.  The cluster will be used as a distributed memory parallel
              computer and will be dedicated to support research in parallel computing,
              bioinformatics and computational biology, and scientific computing.  More
              specifically, the equipment will be used for research in: parallel algorithms
              and software for gene identification, parallel algorithms and software for
              electromagnetic scattering analysis, scalable parallelization of tree-based
              data structures, and integrated software visualization environments for program
              correctness, validation and optimization. Experimental studies will be
              conducted to evaluate the performance of the parallel algorithms developed and
              the knowledge gained from such studies will be used to derive efficient,
              scalable, parallel implementations.  Acquisition of the instrumentation will
              enable researchers to develop, demonstrate and disseminate comprehensive
              software systems that are capable of solving large-scale scientific
              applications of current relevance.
