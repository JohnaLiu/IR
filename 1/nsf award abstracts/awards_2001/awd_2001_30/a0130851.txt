BITS: Fixational eye movements in
              biological and artificial vision systems

Summary

The proposed research
              project has two goals: (1) to determine the specific contributions of small
              eye
movements to the representation of visual information in the brain, and
              (2) to export such mechanisms
to machine vision systems. To accomplish these
              goals, this project will integrate computer modeling of
neural populations,
              robotic experiments and psychophysical experiments with human subjects to
              analyze
the statistical structure of neural activity under natural viewing
              conditions. 
The proposed research will first characterize the influences of
              eye movements on the spatial selectivity of thalamic and cortical cells during
              natural viewing conditions. Then, the activity dynamics of neuronal ensembles
              will be studied, both in terms of efficiency of visual representation and in
              relation to the results of psychophysical studies on the hierarchical structure
              of spatial visual processing. Finally, we will analyze the possible involvement
              of small eye movements in the recovery of distance information during binocular
              free-viewing of a 3D scene. Studies will be conducted with the dual purposes of
              providing new insights on the brain and considering possible applications to
              machine vision systems.
