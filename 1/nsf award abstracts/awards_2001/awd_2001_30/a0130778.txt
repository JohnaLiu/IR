Abstract    :
              The aim of this research proposal is to develop microsensors to based on
              resonant properties of spherical dielectric particles to sense a variety of
              chemical and physical properties of gas and liquid phases.  These microsensors
              make use of extremely sensitive dependence of resonant amplitudes, widths, and
              spectral positions on the index of  refraction, the aborption coefficient and
              the size of a spherical microresonator.  As a first step the temperature,
              humidity and mercury vapor sensors will be developed.
