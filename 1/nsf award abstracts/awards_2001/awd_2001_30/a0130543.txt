This project focuses on geographic pathways and genetic
              mechanisms of invasions by the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha.  Objectives
              of this study are to (1) reconstruct pathways of invasions, from potential
              sources in the Caspian and Black Sea region to North America, (2) clarify
              genetic (evolutionary) relationships among sibling species and identify which
              subspecies are invasive, and (3) describe genetic traits of the invasive
              subspecies.  Using genetic markers, a genealogy (phylogeny) will be constructed
              to determine pathways of invasions and genetic relationships among
              physiological races of zebra mussels.  For this purpose, sensitive genetic
              markers (AFLPs) and powerful data analysis software (Dominant Marker Analysis
              Package) are currently under development.  This project will also involve
              collaborative efforts with scientists at the Russian Academy of Sciences,
              including a joint research cruise on the Caspian Sea to collect from sites
              where the zebra mussel species complex has probably evolved.

The zebra
              mussel ranks among the most hazardous exotic species that has entered North
              American waters, with an economic impact in the billions of dollars.  Despite
              intense ecological interest and efforts toward mitigation, little effort has
              been devoted toward understanding genetic and physiological mechanisms of zebra
              mussel invasions.  We do not know origins of North American populations, their
              genetic traits, and why they are so successful as invaders.  Information from
              this project will enhance our predictive power on range expansion and adaptive
              potential during invasions.  In addition,  as pathways of invasions tend to be
              shared by multiple species, information from this project will yield insight
              into general principles on mechanisms of invasions.
