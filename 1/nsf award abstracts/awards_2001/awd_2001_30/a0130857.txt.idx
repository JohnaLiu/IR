Abstract    :
              EIA-0130857    Elise deDoncker Western Michigan University  CISE Research
              Resources:  Information Visualization and Incremental Knowledge Discovery in a
              Cluster Computing Environment  This proposal seeks funding to enhance a
              64-node PC cluster at Western Michigan University, obtained in part on a
              previous National Science Foundation grant and university funding. Improving
              the cluster will give hardware support for on-going research and education on
              parallel and distributed algorithm design and development.  Although the
              cluster is currently used for various research efforts by different groups in
              the university, this proposal focuses on two of these projects: parallel
              integration and distributed incremental knowledge discovery.   The requested
              infrastructure includes a networking upgrade to support the current
              communication intensive (high bandwidth/low latency) projects.  These include
              the tailoring of load balancing methods underlying the migration of regions in
              adaptive partitioning.  The system will also provide a better environment for
              our study of the scalability of task partitioning methods in numerical
              integration and other areas.  The proposed project on the development of
              methods for incremental knowledge discovery from large databases will further
              be supported by the visualization components of the infrastructure.  This
              effort includes 3D interactive visual exploration of large relational data
              sets.  The techniques will be incorporated in a systematic way into a software
              system for incremental knowledge discovery, and evaluated for effectiveness and
              suitability in different scenarios.
