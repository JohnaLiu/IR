Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at CUNY City College will acquire a
              Circular Dichroism Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a
              number of areas including a) studies on DNA oligomers and duplexes; b)
              investigations on the characterization of isolated fragments of variants of Trx
              as a proxy for the unfolded state of the protein under non-denaturing
              conditions; and c) development of biomaterials for nanoscale photonic
              applications.  

Circular dichroism spectroscopy is an extremely useful tool
              in modern analytical chemistry.  It provides a very reliable and sensitive
              method for assigning absolute molecular configurations.  The results from these
              studies will have an impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry
              and biochemistry.
