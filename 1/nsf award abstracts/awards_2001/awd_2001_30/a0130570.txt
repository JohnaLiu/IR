Abstract    :
              The proposed effort is to organize and provide support for two symposia, one in
              2002 and one in 2004.  The symposia would allow a select group of recent
              doctoral graduates in physical oceanography and related fields to present their
              doctoral research in a setting that allows a more detailed presentation than is
              available at traditional scientific meetings.  The venue would be selected and
              the schedule designed to encourage informal interactions and development of
              relationships that will benefit the community for years in the future.
