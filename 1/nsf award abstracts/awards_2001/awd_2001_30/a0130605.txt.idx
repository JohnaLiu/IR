Abstract    :
              The American Evaluation Association (AEA) is the only National professional
              association for evaluators in the U.S. and, as such, should speak for the
              profession on National policy issues.  However, AEA has never before provided
              guidance to the broader community on public policy issues and therefore lacks
              the procedures to do so.  Having such a voice is particularly critical now with
              the current debate of the Bush Administration's proposal to test all 4th and
              8th grade public school students in mathematics and reading.  Because the
              testing proposal deals specifically with actions that to be taken with regard
              to public schools based on the outcomes of the tests, this is primarily an
              evaluation issue and would benefit from an analysis by evaluators.      AEA
              will create a process for developing a policy statement on the Bush
              Administration testing issue and on three other issues to be selected later
              that also address concerns of the mathematics and science community.  The aim
              is to establish an ongoing capability within the AEA organization to mobilize
              the organization's resources to deal with policy questions.
