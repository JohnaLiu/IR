              Biological Information Technology Systems - BITS: Self-Perfecting Genetic
              Circuits  We propose to develop efficient, evolutionary design strategies for
              constructing functional de novo genetic circuits. We will apply methods of
              molecular evolution, which have proven highly successful for engineering
              proteins with improved or altered properties, to complex genetic systems
              involving multiple repressors, operators, and promoters. We believe that
              evolution will prove to be generally applicable for optimizing individual
              devices as well as complex genetic circuits, and our goal will be to
              demonstrate how evolutionary searches are best performed in order to build
              libraries of devices and assemble them into functional circuits.  We
              anticipate that this research will establish a general strategy for de novo
              genetic circuit design and provide new insight into the natural algorithms of
              information processing in biological systems and biological complexity. This
              research exploits, in powerful combination, the strengths of
              classical approaches in electrical circuit design (characterizing the device
              physics of gates, then composing circuits from well understood components)
              with adaptation mechanisms (mutation and selection)that are the hallmark of
              biological systems.
