CISE Research Resources: 
              Computer Cluster to Support Computational Biology and Other Nonlinear Signal
              Reconstruction and System Design Problems

The grant, an equipment grant,
              will purchase two computers, a compute server and a 3-D visualization
              workstation, in support of the investigators' NSF CISE funded work in
              computational mathematics and its application to the structural biology of
              viruses and other nonlinear signal reconstruction and system design problems. 
              The compute server (Microway, Inc.) is a cluster computer containing 64 Intel
              Pentium III microprocessors and 16 GB of memory organized into 32 nodes
              connected by 100 Mb Ethernet.  The visualization workstation (Sun Microsystems)
              is a workstation with one 900 MHz UltraSPARC-III microprocessor, 1 GB of
              memory, and the intermediate level of Sun's three levels of 3-D graphics
              hardware accelerators.

This equipment will support 3 projects which concern
              computational mathematics including multi-dimensional quadratures, transforms,
              and numerical optimization.  The unifying theme is numerical optimization,
              especially global optimization.  The projects are divided according to
              application and include 3-D reconstruction problems in structural biology and
              systems design problems for nonlinear communication channels.  The main
              application is structural biology, in particular, the structural biology of
              viruses.  The problems of particular interest are 3-D signal reconstruction
              problems for computing the dynamical behavior of viruses from a variety of
              biophysical measurements.
