Title:  
              Topological Quantum Computation

The theory of quantum computation is being
              constructed from abstract study of topological properties of collective
              electron systems. One example is the dancing pattern of quasi-particles in
              fractional Quantum Hall effects. The dancing patterns of quasi-particles are
              described mathematically by braids.  In this context, the Berry phase of the
              quasi-particles gives rise representations of braids. In mathematical terms,
              these are modular functors.

This project is using insights from modular
              functors to investigate the possibilities for physical realization of quantum
              computers. The chief advantage of topological quantum computation is physical
              error correction. The rich mathematical structure of modular functors is also
              employed to design new quantum algorithms. Topological Quantum Computation
              Numerical Laboratory is being established as an intermediate step towards the
              physical implementation of a real quantum computer based on the principles of
              modular functors. A lecture and seminar series at Indiana University is
              organized to training students. This cross-disciplinary project involves
              topology, condensed matter physics, and computer science.
