This workshop will bring together decision makers from
              government and the power industry and technology experts from US and Brazil to
              discuss the solutions to the current energy crises in both countries. The
              workshop organization will be guided by NSF and EPRI. The PI will also work
              closely with the Brazilian colleagues to identify the best team for a
              successful discussion. The workshop is intended to identify the basic research
              needs and fundamental solutions for the future both near-term and long term. 
              This is the first of a series of three NSF/EPRI workshops, whose ultimate goal
              is to promote research leading to a quantum leap in the level, intelligence and
              efficiency of global grid control, whether centralized or distributed. A
              critical issue that this first workshop will address is rapid development of
              the devices that allow an increased level
of controllability in a wide area
              grid.  There is substantial opportunity for the U.S. to learn from the
              successful experience of Brazil with such devices.

The US is facing severe
              national challenges on the electricity infrastructure in the years to come.
              These issues were discussed in President Bush's National Energy Policy: Grand
              Challenge 1: Lack of Transmission Capability; Grand Challenge 2: Operation in a
              Competitive Market Environment; Grand Challenge 3: Power Infrastructure
              Vulnerability.

These grand challenges require basic research to develop
              fundamental solutions to the national problems. Some questions that must be
              answered through basic research are:

o What is the optimal strategy to
              expand the transmission capabilities from an engineering point of view?
o What
              is the strategy to defend, protect and operate the stressed power grids in the
              market environment?
o What is the strategy to ensure that wide area power
              grids are invulnerable facing the various sources of disruption?
o What new
              technologies are needed to meet the grand challenges?
