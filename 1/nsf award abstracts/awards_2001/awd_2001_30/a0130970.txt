Abstract    :
              Tag1 is an autonomous transposable element in Arabidopsis thaliana.  Tag1
              excision and expression are restricted to the reproductive cell lineages in
              developing flowers.  The long-term goal of this research is to elaborate the
              mechanisms and identify the host genes that control Tag1 excision and
              expression during plant development. The specific objectives of this project
              are as follows: (I) Elucidate the developmental control of Tag1 transposase
              expression by pinpointing the cells and stages of flower development in which
              Tag1 expression is active, localizing the cis-acting regulatory elements within
              Tag1 that are responsible for the developmental control of expression and
              identifying host regulatory genes.  (II) Elucidate the developmental control of
              Tag1 excision by searching for host genes that regulate Tag1 excision,
              characterizing mutants/variants that have altered excision patterns,
              determining the effect of known mutations on Tag1 excision and cloning the gene
              encoding the host factor that binds to the 3' end of Tag1.
Transposable
              elements provide powerful tools for studying development and gene function. 
              They have been exploited for mutagenesis, gene shuttling, gene isolation and
              cell lineage studies.  The research on the Tag1 transposon of the plant
              Arabidopsis will advance the study of (I) developmental and genetic regulation
              of transposition in plants, (II) control of plant development and (III) genome
              evolution.
