Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Florida will
              upgrade a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to
              carry out studies on a) cyathane diterpenoids; b) chemoenzymatic synthesis; c)
              organometallic chemistry of group 6 imido diamide complexes; d) nucleic acid
              chemistry; e) linked phenoxide ligands as rigid platforms for the preparation
              of large constructs; and f) synthesis of carbosilane/siloxane segmented
              polymers.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most
              powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of
              molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific
              arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR
              spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
              The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas
              including biochemistry and materials chemistry.
