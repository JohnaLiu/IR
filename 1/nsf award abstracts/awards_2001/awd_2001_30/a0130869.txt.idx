              Resources:  A Shared Data Cluster for Real Time Interaction With Massive
              Datasets  The research at Northwestern is increasingly concerned with the
              issues involved in providing interactive and affordable access to massive
              (terabyte scale) datasets.  In particular, they focus on visualization of these
              datasets using perceptually based computer graphics techniques and display the
              visualizations using a combination PC CAVE and Active Mural.  They also study
              the issues involved with ubiquitous access to high-resolution spatial datasets
              from mobile devices, and leverage a powerful wireless network.  They focus on
              prediction-based adaptation and scheduling for distributed interactive
              applications and are building a compute cluster to support this work.  What
              is missing in the existing shared research infrastructure is a facility to
              store and serve massive datasets interactively, with low latency and high
              bandwidth.  The researchers will build such a shared data cluster.  The data
              cluster will be very high performance and capacity PC RAIDs interconnected with
              a multi-GB/sec SAN.  The SAN will connect to their compute cluster, CAVE/Mural,
              mobile devices and wired client machines.  The combined data and compute
              clusters will be sufficient to pump 200 MB/s from disk to the CAVE/Mural
              screens.  The combination of the data cluster, compute cluster, CAVE/Mural,
              local network infrastructure, and desktop and mobile clients will let them
              study interactivity in the large.
