              Performance Modeling of Complex Hardware/Software Systems through Mixed Level
              Modeling

This project will develop a revolutionary new capability by
              providing a unified design framework for complex, high performance computer
              systems.  This framework includes a performance modeling environment that will
              be integrated into a mixed level hardware/software design environment through
              the use of standard Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and supporting design
              tools.  This framework will allow the modeling of hardware and software systems
              at a high level to enable rapid design space exploration and system performance
              analysis.  The framework will provide the capability to refine these high level
              designs in a step-wise manner into models with more design detail and,
              ultimately into an implementation.  This step-wise refinement capability allows
              areas of the design that are determined to be "high risk" in terms of
              performance to be refined to a more detailed level where the effects on system
              performance of assumptions and design can be realized.
