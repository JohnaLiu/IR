Abstract    :
              EIA-0130724    Philip McKinley Michigan State University  CISE Research
              Resources:  A Proxy-Centric Testbed for Mobile Internet Research  The
              Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University
              will construct a state-of-the-art testbed for research in protocols and
              services surrounding the mobile Internet.  The testbed will comprise four major
              components: (1) a high-performance parallel proxy cluster interconnected by a
              gigabit Ethernet switch; (2) new generation 802.11a wireless network components
              with bit rates up to 54 Mbps; (3) a wireless network analyzer that enables
              detailed inspection and analysis of conditions and behavior of the wireless
              network; and (4) a set of mobile hosts for collecting experimental data.  The
              primary mission of the testbed is to support three research projects related to
              mobile Internet environments: design of new network protocols to improve the
              observed performance of wireless channels in transporting multimedia data;
              study of adaptive middleware services to support collaboration among
              heterogeneous mobile hosts; and the use of formal analysis techniques to
              support automated development and testing of interactive distributed
              applications.
