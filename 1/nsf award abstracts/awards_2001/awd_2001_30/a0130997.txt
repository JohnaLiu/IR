Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois in
              Chicago will acquire an ultrafast Ti:Sapphire laser system and a high power
              Nd:YAG laser. This equipment will enhance research in coherent control of
              chemical reactions, analytical probing of organic thin films, and
              nanolithography.  


A femtosecond laser provides ultrafast pulses of
              coherent visible or infrared light, which enables researchers to obtain
              important information about fast occurring chemical reactions.  Its use may
              enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the properties of reactive and
              nonreactive molecules.
