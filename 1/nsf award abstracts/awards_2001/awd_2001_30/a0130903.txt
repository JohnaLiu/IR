Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University will
              acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable faculty to carry
              out research in the following areas:  a) magneto-electronics of
              transition-metal clusters; b) studies of supramolecular assemblies of cyanine
              dyes on nucleic acid templates; c) environmentally benign hydrogen peroxide
              activators; d) characterization of the catalyst used in atom transfer radical
              polymerization; e) characterization of conducting polymers used in
              self-assembled and nanoscale materials; and f) determination of the rate of
              gated charge transfer.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
              the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the
              structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
              characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
              dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to
              state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact
              in a number of areas including catalysis materials chemistry.
