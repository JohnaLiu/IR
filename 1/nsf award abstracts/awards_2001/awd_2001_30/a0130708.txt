EIA-0130708-Mikhail I. Rabinovich-University of California-San Diego -Title: 
              Principles of Information Dynamics in Basic Neural Circuits:  A Hybrid System
              Approach

Hybrid systems:  biological neurons interacting with electronic
              model neurons via electronic or computer simulated synapses can be a powerful
              approach for understanding basic neural computational principles and for
              building small hybrid and artificial processors that will create new
              perspectives for modern information technologies.

Based on our previous
              studies on neural dynamics in living cells, computer models and analog
              electronic implementations of model neurons and connections, we are planning to
              work in two directions:  (i) we will explore the main principles of information
              processing that uses dynamical elements, i.e. neurons, synapses and small
              neural circuits; and (ii) we will reconfigure real biological networks by
              utilizing electronic neurons and synapses in order to transform such circuits
              into controllable information devices with new functions and new abilities.
