Abstract    :
              EIA-0130887    Enrico Pontelli New Mexico State University  The Laboratory
              for Logic, Databases, and Advanced Programming (LLDAP) plans to acquire modern
              computing equipment to create an infrastructure for parallel and distributed
              computing and for software development for autonomous agents.  The equipment
              requested consists of four Pentium III shared memory machines (with four CPUs
              each) to provide shared memory programming support.  The four machines will be
              connected using fast gigabit Ethernet, creating the testbed for experimenting
              with distributed memory programming.  The Project will also involve the
              acquisition of a set of five autonomous robots.  The equipment will be used to
              support research in three inter-related projects: (1) The goal of the first
              project is to pursue the development of technology to support exploitation of
              different forms of parallelism from traditional logic programming and from
              constraint programming languages,  (2) The second project develops technology
              for the creation of planners capable of dealing with incomplete knowledge,
              dynamic domains, and sensing actions, (3) The goal of the third project is to
              develop technology to promote accessibility of Web documents in the context of
              Web-based course-ware engineering.
