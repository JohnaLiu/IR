Abstract    :
              This project provides for continued development and public access to the
              national Information Service for Earthquake Engineering (NISEE) at the
              University of California, Berkeley.  The Earthquake Engineering Abstracts
              database, which will soon reach 100,000 citations of the technical literature,
              is the premier source of earthquake engineering research literature in the
              world.  The NISEE Software Library of 114 programs in source code has
              successfully turned a long-term investment in NSF engineering research at
              universities into an affordable public good for engineering analysis and
              design.   The grant also supports a workshop designed to review the needs and
              directions within NSF's evolving George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake
              Engineering Simulation (NEES) program.  In conjunction with management of
              NISEE, the PIs will conduct the workshop to identify needs and opportunities in
              the information environment created by the formation of the NEES collaboratory.
               The workshop will include representatives from the Science and Engineering
              Digital Library project at Cornell University, and also managers of curated
              databases in the physics community (e.g., Lawrence Livermore Laboratory) and
              industry representatives.  The proceedings will include recommendations on
              needs and future directions in information services in the future.
