Abstract    :
              EIA-0130798    Miroslav Martinovic The College of New Jersey  CISE Research
              Resources:  Purpose-Driven Natural Language Processing  The unifying theme of
              the three projects (WHAT, QASTIIR, and Hopewell) is the integration of
              methodologies of computational linguistics with statistical techniques and
              their cooperative application to question answering and information retrieval
              systems. QASTIIR (Question Answering System Through Intelligent Information
              Retrieval) considers where and when techniques of computational linguistics
              could best improve performance of a hybrid statistical/linguistic question
              answering system. WHAT (Web Host Access Tool) addresses client-side
              personalization of web search queries, exploiting semantics to disambiguate
              keyword meaning. The Hopewell project automates K-12 curriculum mapping
              (essentially a digital library of curriculum resources achieved through teacher
              consensus).  NLP/IR techniques should reduce the need for middle layer
              expertise to manipulate map databases.  All three projects address how to
              disambiguate logical and set expression queries. QASTIIR takes the most
              theoretical approach, developing theory through established protocols for
              testing.  The WHAT domain provides a highly ambiguous real-world domain using
              well established databases.  Hopewell project provides a second real-world
              domain whose semantics are more constrained, but that requires a database
              design responsive to novice querying.  Anticipated outcomes are (1) new theory
              development in natural language processing, (2) highly private user profile
              development, (3) application of NLP technology to digital library development
              and retrieval.
