Abstract    :
              Professor Gina Hoatson of William and Mary College has a grant from the
              Solid-State Chemistry and Analytical and Surface Chemistry Programs to support
              student participation in the NMR Symposium of the Rocky Mountain Conference on
              Analytical Chemistry.  This four day meeting is recognized internationally as
              top solid state NMR meeting  in the US.  This meeting will focus on the
              application of NMR to key problems in materials science including nanoparticles
              and interfaces.  Currently 20% of the speakers are women and 13% are minority. 
              Historically, the conference is well attended by students.  This support is
              targeted at partially funding students and postdocs to enable them to attend
              the meeting.  The meeting will occur from July 29-August 3, 2001.
