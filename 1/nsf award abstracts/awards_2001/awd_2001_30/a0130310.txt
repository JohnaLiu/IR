              Proposal Title: Adaptation of Bluetooth Technology for Wireless Sensing Project
              Abstract:
In this project, we are proposing to develop the communication
              interface that will allow microsensors such Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) sensors
              to transfer sensor data to a Bluetooth communication module for wireless data
              telemetry to a remote computer. Wireless transmission of sensor data will be
              compared with direct acquisition of sensor data using traditional wired
              methods. Since line of sight communication is not required in such systems,
              studies will be conducted to assess data transmission capabilities from within
              a variety of enclosures made of different materials. Lithium Niobate SAW
              devices operating at three different frequencies will be acquired for this
              purpose. They can serve as very good temperature sensors.  All three sensors
              will be operated simultaneously in close proximity to verify sensor
              identification capability of the communication system. This proof of concept
              system is expected to serve as foundational work for the wide use of this
              technology for a variety of sensor systems including SAW and MEMS sensors. One
              graduate student and one undergraduate student will be supported on the
              project.
