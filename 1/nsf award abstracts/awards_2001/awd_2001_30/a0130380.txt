Abstract    :
              Interaction between northern temperate forests and the atmosphere is the focus
              of the Chequamegon Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (ChEAS).  The ChEAS scientists
              are studying forests of northern Wisconsin to understand the carbon and water
              cycles of the forest-atmosphere system and their role in the earth's climate
              system.  The ultimate goal is to learn how the northern forest-atmosphere
              system will respond to increases in greenhouse gases, land-use change, and
              natural climate variations.  The components that contribute to the carbon and
              water cycles range from the size of a soil bacteria or leaf pore to the global
              circulation of the jet stream.  Some processes, like photosynthesis, vary from
              one minute to the next with the passing of cumulus clouds, while others, such
              as forest succession, respond to climate patterns that persist over decades or
              even centuries.  No single scientific method can encompass these vast scales of
              time, space, and disciplinary expertise.  The ChEAS research collaboration
              network provides funds for students, faculty and research scientists from a
              wide variety of disciplines, including atmospheric science, ecology and
              hydrology, and institutions to exchange data, personnel, and scientific
              understanding.  This exchange of information will accelerate our understanding
              of the forest-atmosphere component of the earth's climate and will help to
              train a new generation of earth system scientists.
