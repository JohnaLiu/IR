Abstract    :
              Recent research has documented dramatic population declines and extinctions of
              frogs, toads, and salamanders in many parts of the New World tropics, a pattern
              seen in North America and elsewhere in the world.  We propose the formation of
              RANA, the Research and Analysis network for Neotropical Amphibians, to
              coordinate scientists from a variety of institutions examining this issue.  The
              goal is to promote collaborative research that takes advantage of the
              tremendous habitat and taxonomic diversity of the New World tropics.  Members
              of RANA will collect data to test leading hypotheses for population declines,
              including disease, climate change, and UV-B radiation. 

Reports of
              extinctions, deformities, and population declines of amphibians frequently
              appear in the popular media, and represent a modern day mystery to scientists. 
              The global nature of this biodiversity crisis means that we have to look
              outside of our borders to provide insights on why large numbers of frogs are
              disappearing in many regions of the US, including Sierra Nevada and the Cascade
              Mountains.  This project will produce a bilingual Spanish-English
              publicly-available website with information on amphibian declines and a
              database with information on the status of all species of the New World
              tropics.
