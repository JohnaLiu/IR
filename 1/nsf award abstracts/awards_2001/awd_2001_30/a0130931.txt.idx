              Sciences  BDEI: Towards an Operational Semantics Diversity: Integrating
              Structure  Summary  Understanding the dynamics of biological diversity
              requires new approaches and integration between different disciplines. The
              development of a unitary body of knowledge about biodiversity is made
              difficult by the fragmentation and lack of interoperability between the
              diverse - and often informal and simplistic - semantics adopted for data and
              models. Different representational paradigms require conceptual, as well as
              technical, integration to enable reorganizing the body of knowledge and
              enable new ideas, theories, and higher-level paradigms to surface and be
              tested. Building on software and conceptual frameworks being developed at
              IEE/UMD, we propose to develop and deploy a web-accessible database where
              temporally- and spatially- explicit biodiversity data will coexist with
              dynamic modular models, potentially integrating multiple modeling paradigms
              and automatically enforcing their compatibility. The XML-based infrastructure
              used by the underlying software engine will enable us to store data and models
              (modules) adopting an extensible array of representations, and to link them
              together transparently and automatically. The integration will happen through
              explicit cross-cutting abstractions called domains, which represent various
              aspects of the world (such as time or space) as seen by each module, and are
              processed by the simulation engine to resolve conflicts related to different
              scales or representational paradigms.
