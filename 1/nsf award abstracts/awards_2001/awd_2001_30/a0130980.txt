Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of California in
              Irvine will acquire a High Performance Liquid Chromatograph-Electrospray
              Ionization Mass Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number
              of areas including a) the separation and analysis of diastereomeric
              polysiliconates and the evaluation of affinity supports for the separation of
              oligonucleotides and small peptides (Shea); b) the synthesis of beta-sheet
              mimics for protein recognition and function research (Nowick); c) novel
              strategies and mechanistic studies for natural product synthesis (Overman); d)
              the synthesis of highly oxygenated macrolide natural products with potential
              cytotoxic and anti-fungal applications (Rychnovsky); and e) the synthesis of
              dityrosine and ditryptophan crosslinked peptides as protein structure probes
              (Van Vranken).  

Liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection
              (LC-MS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation and analysis
              of complex mixtures.  The research that this instrument will enable will have a
              significant impact in the areas of biochemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry,
              among others.
