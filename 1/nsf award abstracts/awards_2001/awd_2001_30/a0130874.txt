Abstract    :
              EIA-0130874 -John Yin -University of Wisconsin -Genomic Information Processing
              by a Virus-Host System

The proposed research aims to advance biologically
              inspired computing by providing insights into the mechanisms and dynamic of
              genomic information processing for an experimentally well-characterized system.
               The system of study will be a computer simulation for the growth of
              bacteriophage T7 in Escherichia coli, a model virus-host system that integrates
              genetic, physiological, biochemical, and biophysical laboratory data spanning
              more than 30 years.  The overarching aim of the study will be to identify and
              characterize modular features of integrated information processing during the
              simulated intracellular growth of the virus.  More specifically, the work will
              entail defining measures of system performance under different host resource
              environments, quantifying the sensitivity of this performance to perturbations
              of pair-wise and higher order interactions between genetically-encoded
              functions, and extracting from these studies patterns of interaction that
              reflect modular features of biological information processing.
