Abstract    :
              AST-0130790

This award will enable continued operations of the Kitt Peak 12m
              (KP12m) millimeter-wave telescope for 18 months while the University of Arizona
              (UA) puts in place a plan to operate the facility using private funds.   The
              KP12m was formerly operated as a national user facility by the National Radio
              Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).   The UA and the Research Corporation will also
              contribute funds toward operations during the privatization period.  The
              privatization plan calls for integration of the operations of the KP12m and the
              Heinrich Hertz Telescope, a submillimeter telescope on Mount Graham in Arizona,
              under a single director to reduce total operating costs. The UA will seek other
              partners to form a consortium to operate both telescopes for the longer term. 
              The KP12m, though over 30 years old, has continued to produce significant
              scientific results in recent years.  The benefit to science of successful
              privatization will be that a still useful telescope will continue to enable
              research in millimeter astronomy, helping to maintain the community of
              millimeter astronomers in the US as a prelude to ALMA (the Atacama Large
              Millimeter Array).   During the bridge period, telescope time will be allocated
              to the general astronomical community in proportion to NSF's share of the
              operations burden.
