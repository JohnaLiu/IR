Abstract    :
              EIA-0130812 Andreas G. Andreou Johns Hopkins University A Comparative Study of
              Information Processing in Biological and Bio-inspired systems:  Performance
              Criteria, Resources Tradeoffs and Fundamental Limits

We propose a research
              program towards a fundamental and quantitative understanding of the tradeoffs
              between system performance and resources such as size, reliability and energy
              requirements for biological and bio-inspired microsystems.  We employ the
              mathematical tools of communication theory and model natural or synthetic
              physical structures as micro-scale communication networks, studying them under
              physical constraints at two different levels of abstraction.  At the functional
              level we examine the operational and task specification, while at the
              implementation level we examine the physical specification and realization. 
              Both levels of abstraction are characterized by Shannon's channel capacity, as
              determined by the channel bandwidth, the signal power; and the noise power. 
              The link between the functional level and the physical level of abstraction is
              established through first principles and phenomenological otherwise, models for
              transformations on the signal, physical constraints on the system, and noise
              that degrades the signal.
