Little is known about the role of plant disease in
              natural ecosystems, but several current environmental concerns motivate a
              greater understanding.  When considering the potential effects of climate
              change, invasions of new pathogen species, or movement of disease resistance
              genes from genetically modified crop species to wild plant populations,
              understanding the role of plant disease in natural ecosystems is key.  We
              propose a study of plant disease in the tallgrass prairie to provide
              information relevant to these concerns as well as to a general theoretical
              understanding of pathogen ecology and the role pathogens may play in
              determining the success of particular plant species.  Plants in the tallgrass
              prairie of North America are of particular interest because so little area
              remains of this ecosystem and attempts to restore tallgrass prairie are an
              important focus of conservation efforts in the Great Plains.  In this study we
              will provide information about the abundance of pathogen species and the
              patterns of their co-occurrence on a set of representative tallgrass prairie
              plant species found at the Konza Prairie Biological Station (KPBS), an NSF LTER
              site in the Flint Hills tallgrass prairie region in northeastern Kansas.  We
              will also estimate the effects of predicted climate change scenarios, landscape
              patterns of microclimate variation, and burning cycle patterns, and work to
              refine sampling methods for characterizing pathogen populations within natural
              plant populations.  This study will supply an essential baseline data set for
              plant diseases at KPBS to complement the LTER database on plant species
              composition and productivity.
