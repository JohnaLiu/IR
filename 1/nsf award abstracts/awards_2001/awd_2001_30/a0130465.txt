It is proposed to perform research in
              three areas of fluid mechanics: free surface flows, geophysical mixing, and
              sedimentation in stratified fluids.  The free surface flow consists of
              experimental and analytical study of Marangoni convection in thin films and
              fluid polygons. The geophysical mixing forced by plumes and gravity currents
              will be studied by detailed experiments.  The physical processes involved in
              the sedimentation in stratified fluids will be studied by experimental and
              analytical means.  The education plan is aimed to bring direct experimental
              experience in fluid dynamics research to Mathematics undergraduate and graduate
              students in MIT and to high school students and teachers.  The PI has been
              supervising undergraduates in the design and construction of laboratory
              experiments for educational and research purposes. And such activities will
              continue.  The PI will also participate in two of the MIT's high school
              outreach programs.  One is the Science and Engineering Program for Teachers,
              the other is to involve promising high school students in summer research
              program.
