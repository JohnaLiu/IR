Abstract    :
              EIA-0130673    Xian-He Sun Illinois Institute of Technology  CISE Research
              Resources:  Acquisition of a Computing Cluster and Access Grid Node for
              Information Technology Research  The Department of Computer Science at the
              Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) will purchase an 82 node Linux cluster,
              an Access Grid node, and several workstations, all of which will be connected
              via a high-speed network.  These computational resources will be dedicated to
              the support of several on-going research projects in the area of information
              technology.  Such projects include the development of a process migration
              environment for heterogeneous distributed computing, design and implementation
              of scalable information systems, scalable distributed simulation in support of
              complex systems management, and scalable parallel numerical algorithms and
              simulations.  These projects require significant computing power and
              high-performance networks. Such resources are not currently available within
              the university.  The acquisition of these resources through the NSF CISE
              Instrumentation program is critical to the success of these research projects,
              and to the development of a strong computer science program at IIT. 
              Additionally, the requested equipment will offer an excellent platform upon
              which students can learn about and experience state-of-the-art research via
              course work and term projects.
