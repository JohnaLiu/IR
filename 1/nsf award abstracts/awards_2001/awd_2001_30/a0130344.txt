CISE Research Resources: 
              A Flexible Video Networking Infrastructure to Support Massively Scalable
              Information Flows

This research project proposes the establishment of a
              flexible video networking testbed in the Department of Computer Science and
              Engineering at the Oregon Graduate Institute.  The main purpose of this
              architecture is to facilitate experimental research in systems that support
              massively scalable information flows.  Focus will be on four main tasks:  (1)
              Scalable Video Distillation Architectures - providing mechanisms to support the
              aggregation of large numbers of video streams in a video sensor network; (2)
              Scalable Video Multicast Distribution Protocols - providing scalable mechanisms
              that support quality and rate adaptive video for multicast over overlay
              networks; (3) An Integrated Approach to Resource Management for Internet
              Applications - combining application-level knowledge with low-level networking
              to provide scalable Internet application architectures, and (4) A Video Archive
              - creating an extensive testset of video data for use within our experiments as
              well as for distribution of statistical and frame size information to the rest
              of the research community.
