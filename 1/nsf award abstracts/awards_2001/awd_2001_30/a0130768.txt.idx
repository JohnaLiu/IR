Abstract    :
              EIA-0130768    Sudeep Sarkar University of South Florida  CISE Research
              Resources:  A Compute-Intensive Sensor-Based Environment for Research in
              Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence  Automated learning of grouping
              parameters for perceptual organization of complex images, modeling and
              reconstruction of elastic objects from image sequences, real-time matching of
              buyers and sellers for E-commerce, and learning models from extremely large
              databases, all require large data storage and a computing environment that
              supports exploring extremely large parameter spaces along with the ability to
              process huge quantities of data. A multiprocessor computing environment with
              substantial memory and disk storage is requested for high-performance computing
              associated with these four research projects in the general areas of computer
              vision and artificial intelligence. The compute server will increase the
              present capabilities by an order of magnitude.  In addition, image
              acquisition devices, including high-resolution color cameras, digital video
              cameras, stereo cameras, and laser range scanners are requested for gathering
              color, motion, and range data.  The ability to acquire fast range images and
              motion sequences will enable the consideration of the problem of integrating
              motion and range into the perceptual organization process. Also, the ability to
              acquire fast and high-resolution range, with registered color, will facilitate
              development of physics-based non-rigid algorithms and models that incorporate
              true material properties, which have, heretofore, not been possible.
