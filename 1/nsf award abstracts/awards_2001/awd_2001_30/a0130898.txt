Abstract    :
              EIA-130898-John Granacki-University of Southern California- Architectures for
              Neuromimetic Information System

Biologically inspired computing modules
              performing spatio-temporal pattern recognition will be a key aspect of future
              computing systems.  Current prototypes of biomimetic circuit models have
              demonstrated real-time performance at very low power levels and high physical
              density.  Further, these simple structures are capable of recognizing signal
              patterns masked by significant noise levels.  These properties are difficult to
              mimic in digital signal processing algorithms, which require substantial
              modification when adapting to new applications.

We propose to implement
              second-order dynamic synapse neural models with digital equivalents that use
              features extracted from software simulations.  Arrays of these digital
              equivalents can be readily implemented in dense re-useable commercial
              field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), enabling very high-speed operation. 
              Additional features, such as writeable registers for user tuning of dynamics,
              will accelerate the evaluation of new kernels as well as enable investigation
              of high-speed "super-time" learning.
