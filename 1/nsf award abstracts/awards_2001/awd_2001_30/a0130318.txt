Abstract    :
              The Museum of Science in Boston is proposing to work with eight other science
              centers to investigate how science centers might collaborate to enhance the
              public understanding of research.  The purpose of the planning effort is to
              identify and elaborate on promising approaches to increase the public
              understanding of the nature of scientific research, the process of
              technological innovation, and the interaction between science and technology
              and societal issues.  Planning will be conducted in the context of three topics
              (tentative):  global climate change, alternative energy sources, and
              genetically modified foods.  Questions to be explored include:

what it would
              take for each science center to offer exhibits and presentations on all three
              topics,
how can the exhibits be kept current,
what is the best mechanism for
              keeping science centers informed about current research,
what would motivate
              visitors to return in order to follow a single line of research,
how can
              visitors best continue their connection with the science centers after their
              visits,
what will science centers change in the way they develop exhibits and
              programs in order to present current science and technology,
what costs and
              logistical factors will need to be taken into consideration,
will "one size
              fit all" or will different designs be needed for different science centers,
              and
how might the exhibits and programs be designed to encourage the
              incorporation of local resources.

The project will be coordinated with other
              media that are developing efforts to convey on-going science to the public. 
              Evan Hadingham, Science Editor for NOVA at WGBH, will bring the perspective of
              television production; Rob Semper from the Exploratorium will represent the
              Internet; and Bruce Lowenstein, Editor of Public Understanding of Science, will
              represent print.  The science centers participating in the planning effort
