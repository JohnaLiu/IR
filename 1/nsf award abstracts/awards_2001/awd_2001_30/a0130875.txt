Abstract    :
              To facilitate the development of theories for biological information processing,
              it would be useful to have a system that permits a priori specification of the
              connection in a neural network.  By defining the connectivity in a neural
              network, the system will allow rapid prototyping of arbitrary neuronal
              architectures.  Ideally, such a system would be able to not only recapitulate
              in vivo structure, but also be able to create novel neural structures in a
              user-defined manner.  Such user-defined networks will then allow more rigorous
              testing of theories for biological information processing in the nervous system
              and will potential result in the identification of novel information processing
              paradigms in general.  In this project, the following issues will be
              addressed:

a) Identify the determinants of successful neurite elicitation
              under applied force.
b) Compare engineered network behavior to model network
              behavior  to assess whether neuronal information processing is linear or
              nonlinear.
c) Develop approaches to scale-up that allow multiple connections
              to be formed.
