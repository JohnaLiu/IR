Title: Causes of Robustness
              and Vulnerability in Real-world Networks: Lessons from molecular
              biology

Vulnerability of natural networks (such as the Internet, power
              supply grid, or molecular regulatory circuits of cells) to perturbations is an
              important area of study.  Prior work has traditionally involved observations on
              static networks or on computer simulations, and has revealed certain general
              fundamental properties.  Specifically, the study of one representative natural
              network by direct experimental manipulation should illuminate general
              properties of most networks.  The molecular machinery regulating the synthesis
              of RNA molecules in the nucleus of budding yeast forms a natural network that
              can be experimentally perturbed, and their effects studied by transcriptional
              profiling on DNA microarrays.  In this initial funding period, study of the
              responses of a sub-section (comprised of approximately 300 nodes) of this
              natural network as a function of precise perturbations in the form of gene
              knockout mutations. A queriable, static, database model of the network is being
              made, which is queried by simple attack plans, and responses are tested for
              consistency with experimental results.  This interplay is allowing a
              proof-of-principle demonstration of this empirical approach to studying
              properties of complex networks.  Insights obtained from these studies is
              forming the basis of more sophisticated investigation of complex network
              properties.
