Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Youngstown State University will
              acquire a Glove Box and Vacuum Line Systems for Materials Synthesis and
              Characterization. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies
              on NS heterocyclic materials, organometallic crystal engineered materials,
              alkanethiol monolayers, monolayer organometallic films, metallocenophanes,
              organometallic nanoscale rigid-rod and star-shaped materials, and solid state
              nitride/fluoride compounds.   

Research-grade glove boxes enable researchers
              to handle air-sensitive materials.  This equipment will enrich the
              materials-related research program at Youngstown State University and also
              provide hands-on experience for undergraduate and masters students in the
              advanced inorganic chemistry and polymer science laboratory courses.
