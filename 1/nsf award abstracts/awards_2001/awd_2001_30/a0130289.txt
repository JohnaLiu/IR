Abstract    :
              Biodiversity represents a complex and rapidly changing feature of
ecosystems
              that is currently under intensive investigation by two distinct
groups of
              scientists; those that study its distribution and those that
study its
              function in ecological processes.  Understanding the
environmental
              consequences of widespread changes in biodiversity, however,
requires bringing
              these groups together.  BioMERGE (Biotic Mechanisms of
Ecosystem Regulation in
              the Global Environment) will be a
research-coordinating network that will
              foster the merger of these two
groups.  It will develop electronic networks to
              coordinate the sharing and
dissemination of scientific findings among
              participating scientists.  It
will also sponsor a series of workshops that
              will periodically assemble
core participants to resolve emerging theoretical
              and empirical issues,
develop analytical tools, evaluate and recommend
              scientific protocol, and
identify future priorities in biodiversity research. 
              BioMERGE will also
serve as an information gateway for both scientists and
              non-scientists
alike by providing non-technical consensus papers,
              bibliographies,
glossaries, and summaries of important findings.
