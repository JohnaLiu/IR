Partial travel
              support for Young speakers in the early stages of their careers and for senior
              graduate students and postdocs are requested for this 2002 Gordon Conference. 
              The major objective of this Gordon Conference is to provide a forum for new and
              established scientists and engineers in colloidal, macromolecular, and
              polyelectrolyte solutions to discuss and exchange information.  The conference
              will facilitate discussion and exploration of ideas at the forefront of the
              many complexities of the charged, macromolecular, interfacial and
              solutions.

This conference has always had interdisciplinary participation
              from the engineering, physics, chemistry, and biochemistry communities.  An
              important component of the conference is the inclusion of young scientists and
              engineers.  

The various session in the conference include self assembly on
              surfaces, self assembly in solutions, ordering and nanostructures, proteins at
              surfaces, single molecule analysis, DNA sequencing, flow and microarrays, and
              polyelectrolytes in biophysics.
