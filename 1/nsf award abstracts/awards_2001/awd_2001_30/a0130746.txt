Abstract    :
              EIA 0130746-Giles J. Laurent-California Institute of Technology - Biological
              computation in olfactory systems:  experiments, theory and analog circuit
              modeling

Pattern recognition  (e.g., face, voice recognition) remains one of
              the most difficult problems for computer science.  Odors are complex physical
              objects (blends of molecules) and yet, are perceived as singular objects (e.g.,
              coffee, jasmine); because olfactory circuit designs appear similar across
              animal species (from insects to mammals), olfaction constitutes a potentially
              ideal system to identify key solutions to pattern recognition.  The
              investigators are an interdisciplinary team from Biology, Physics, Computer
              Science and Electrical Engineering from Caltech and from the University of
              California-San Diego.  They are investigating the basic computational
              principles of olfactory processing and recognition in animals,  with the
              long-term goal to build "intelligent" pattern storage and recognition devices,
              designed using rules inspired by neurobiology.

We plan to study how to build
              simple and later, scale up, both in number of processors and in frequency,
              "electronic antennal lobes and mushroom bodies" so that one might, in the
              future, adapt and exploit the design of biological pattern recognizers and
              provide new computational paradigms for human uses.
