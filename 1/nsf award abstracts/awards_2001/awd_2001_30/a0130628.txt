Abstract    :
              Stigma is an example of a culturally and socially determined behavior that has
              enormous impact on the health of individuals and populations worldwide.  It is
              time for a major behavioral and social science approach to complement the legal
              approach and moral reproach that have characterized the global response to
              stigma regarding persons with marginalizing illnesses, such as schizophrenia ,
              epilepsy and HIV/AIDS.  This award is in support of an international conference
              that will take place over two and a half days in September, 2001.  The
              conference is hosted by the Fogarty International Center at the NIH.  Sessions
              will focus on cross cutting, socio-cultural issues including policy.  It will
              also include sessions on population genetics and stigma.
