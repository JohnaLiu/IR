Abstract    :
              Cellular Mechanisms of Encoding Space-Time in the Monkey Brain

	Perceptions
              and memories are organized in brain in such a way that the spatial and temporal
              patterns of the original sensory stimuli are faithfully represented.  This
              ability to encode space and time, intertwined as space-time in the physical
              world, is a fundamental feature of the nervous system.   The cellular
              mechanisms of this encoding process in the primate brain are unclear.  The
              present project employs a novel method to reveal how the neurons of the monkey
              hippocampus contribute to the encoding of space.  Specifically, the firing of
              single hippocampal neurons are recorded for as long as 24 hours in squirrel
              monkeys moving freely on the walls and floor of a test chamber.  During this
              period, the animals are performing a spatial memory task and allowed to eat,
              drink, rest and sleep.  The hypothesis is tested that in these conditions most
              hippocampal neurons express a complex firing pattern tuned to process
              information on large sectors in space.  Importantly, the experiments set the
              stage for examining the involvement of these cells in encoding time, as well. 
              Thus, in the long run, this project will significantly contribute to the
              development of a unified concept on encoding space and time in the monkey
              brain.  Such a concept should have a broad impact on cognitive neuroscience and
              should help to understand the uniquely sophisticated operation of the primate
              brain.
