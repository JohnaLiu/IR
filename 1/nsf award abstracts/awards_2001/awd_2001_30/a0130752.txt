Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Tennessee in
              Knoxville will acquire an Electrospray/Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption
              Ionization Quadrupole - Time of Flight (MALDI Q-TOF) Hybrid Mass Spectrometer. 
              This instrument will be used for a) studies on the characterization of polymers
              and amyloid fibrils; studies of multiply charged anions; and for the synthesis
              and characterization of telechelic materials.  In addition, investigators at
              Knoxville will investigate aminoglycoside antibiotic modifying enzymes; light
              regulation of plant development; and protein components of amyloid plaques. 
              

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF)
              mass spectrometry is the technique of choice for obtaining accurate molecular
              weights on molecules up to and over 300,000 daltons, with extremely high
              sensitivity.  These studies utilizing the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer will have
              an impact in chemistry, biochemistry and materials research.
