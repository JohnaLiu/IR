Abstract    :
              0130839    Patrick Flynn University of Notre Dame  CISE Research Resources: 
              Instrumentation for Multidimensional Imaging and Applications  The award
              contributes to the purchase of (a) specialized sensors and actuators (range
              scanners, digital video facilities, 3D fabrication equipment), (b)
              high-performance computing equipment (a Beowulf cluster and  high-performance
              workstations), and (c) infrastructure (including a network-attached disk array
              and networking hardware).  The proposed equipment will support current and
              planned research in image processing and understanding.   Research in planning
              and currently underway that will employ the facility includes image and video
              processing (range image compression techniques, image compression artifact
              mitigation, and high-resolution video from sensor fusion), image analysis and
              solid modeling (image segmentation, skeletonization, object representation, and
              applications in orthopedics and gait analysis), and empirical evaluation of
              image understanding algorithms (performance of low-level and high-level image
              understanding tasks as well as 3D modeling techniques). The planned facility
              will foster the continued development of a nascent image processing and
              understanding research group at the University of Notre Dame, and the research
              topics to be supported were carefully examined to validate their ability to
              take advantage of the proposed equipment acquisition.
