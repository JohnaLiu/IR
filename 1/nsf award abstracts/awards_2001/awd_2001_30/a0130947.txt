Abstract    :
              Professor John Wright of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study coherent two-dimensional
              vibrational spectroscopy. Doubly vibrationally enhanced (DOVE) four wave mixing
              (FWM) methods pioneered by this group will be complemented by new doubly
              degenerate FWM methods, such as the use of two tunable infrared lasers to drive
              three infrared transitions and a fourth output beam.  These methods will be
              used in a variety of ways to explore the utility of coherent two dimensional
              methods for analytical measurements.  Certain advantages such as line-narrowing
              and selective component enhancement in complex mixtures can be achieved,
              relieving current problems in vibrational spectroscopy such as spectral
              congestion.  Hydrogen bonded liquids will be studied. 

Infrared spectroscopy
              is commonly used to study and monitor industrial processes analytically.  New
              laser-based spectroscopic methods can potentially make more tractable the IR
              spectroscopy of proteins, for example, which will be of use in basic and
              applied biochemical and biotechnological research.
