Abstract    :
              Indonesia currently faces a period of social instability marked by a struggling
              economy and widespread political uncertainty.  This dissertation research
              project will ask how concepts of morality, masculinity, and selfhood shape the
              way Minangkabau men in the West Sumatran city of Bukittinggi adapt to these
              conditions.  West Sumatra is a particularly compelling area in which to examine
              issues of gender and morality in modern Indonesia due to its unusual mix of a
              matrilineal social structure with a widespread commitment to Islam.  The
              research plan consists primarily of participant-observation of men's lives in
              Bukittinggi, interviews concerning the cultural meanings of men's roles and
              their moral significance, and extended, person-centered interviews conducted
              with a small number of respondents.  These methods are designed to elicit
              information on the relationship between cultural conceptions of morality and
              masculinity, the shape of social and economic life in Bukittinggi-and in
              Indonesia more generally-and Minangkabau men's experiences of themselves as
              masculine, moral actors.  In addition to contributing to the training of a
              young anthropologist, this study will further the development of
              anthropological theories of self and subjectivity, and illuminate the dynamic
              engagement between individuals and cultural worlds experiencing uncertainty and
              transformation.
