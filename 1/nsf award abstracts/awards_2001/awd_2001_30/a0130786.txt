Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of California in
              Riverside will acquire an Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectrometer. 
              Among the research programs in which EPR spectroscopy will play a vital role
              are: a) bioinorganic chemistry or iron porphyrins, redox chemistry of
              fullerenes, metalloporphyrin/fullerene supramolecular chemistry and reactive
              radical cations across the periodic table (Reed); b) characterization of
              porphyrin pi-cation radicals in multiporphyrin arrays (Bocian); c) studies on
              carbon nanotubes and neutral organic conductors (Haddon); d) investigations on
              the mechanism of manganese catalyzed water oxidation in photosystem II (Debus);
              e) trapping of fluorocarbonyl radicals (Morton); and f) development of new
              analytical tools for assessing chirality (Mueller).  

An electron
              paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer is an instrument used to obtain
              information about the molecular and electronic structure of molecules. It may
              also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals which
              are often essential for the initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety of
              chemical reactions.  These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, in
              particular biological chemistry and materials sciences.
