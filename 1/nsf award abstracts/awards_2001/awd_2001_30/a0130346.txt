Abstract    :
              This project is a series of Interdisciplinary Conferences in Applied Mathematics
              conducted by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) over
              three years.  The conferences are designed to bring together mathematical
              scientists, computational scientists, engineers, and applications scientists
              who are developing and applying new mathematical concepts, methods, and
              algorithms.   A successful feature of this series is the inclusion of focused,
              interdisciplinary,  academic/industry workshops. A new feature is a focus on
              workshops to  encourage diversity in the mathematical and computational science
              workforce. The primary objective of the conferences is to initiate new
              interaction among the creators and users of the mathematical and     
              computational science and thereby contribute to the understanding of
              mathematics and encourage its application to problems of society.
