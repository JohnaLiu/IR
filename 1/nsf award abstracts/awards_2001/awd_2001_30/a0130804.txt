The Role of LEAFY in Reproductive Development in
              Arabidopsis
The switch from juvenile to reproductive phase occurs in all
              higher organisms. Control of the proper timing of this switch is vital. In
              plants the transition from vegetative to reproductive development is also of
              agronomical importance as seeds, the storage reserves which human sustenance
              largely depends on, are the product of the reproductive phase. 
The
              transcription factor LEAFY (LFY) is a key regulator of the floral transition, a
              central step in the switch from vegetative to reproductive development. Later
              in the reproductive phase LFY controls flower patterning. Despite its central
              role in these processes, events downstream of LFY are poorly understood. Only
              two direct targets of LFY are known. Genetic evidence indicates that additional
              LFY-controlled target genes play critical roles in reproductive development. We
              will employ genomic molecular approaches to identify these unknown
              LFY-regulated target genes. The proposal is based on posttranscriptional
              activation of a LFY fusion protein that allows identification of genes whose
              expression change rapidly in response to LFY activation. Biological
              significance of the identified novel LFY-regulated target genes will be
              investigated.
