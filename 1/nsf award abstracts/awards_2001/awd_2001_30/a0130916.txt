Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas in
              Austin will acquire a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable
              researchers to carry out studies on a) molecular sensors; b) synthesis of
              "foldamer" molecules that fold into a compact, predictable higher-order
              structure; c) synthesis of porphyrins and synthetic porphyrin analogues; and d)
              the fabrication of materials with desired interfacial properties.  

Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
              identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms
              within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules
              in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
              studies will have an impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry.
