Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of California in
              Berkeley will upgrade two 400 MHz NMR Spectrometers with new consoles and
              variable temperature capabilities. This equipment will enable faculty to carry
              out research in the following areas:  a) exploratory and mechanistic studies of
              stoichiometric and catalytic organometallic reactions; b) synthesis of
              glycopeptide mimics by chemoselective ligation; c) applications of sulfonamides
              and sulfinamides to asymmetric synthesis and parallel synthesis; d)
              preparation, characterization and use of dendrimers; e) structure and dynamics
              of metallo-supramolecular assemblies; and f) cobalt-mediated syntheses.  
              

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
              available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
              used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from
              these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas including catalysis
              and materials chemistry.
