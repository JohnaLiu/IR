Abstract    :
              EIA-0130400 Robert Joynt University of Wisconsin-Madison  Title: Connecting
              the Quantum Dots; Theory of Quantum Computing in a Solid-state
              Implementation  A program of theoretical research on quantum computation in
              quantum dot structures is underway.  In this type of quantum computer, the
              qubits are the spins of electrons trapped in a silicon-germanium semiconductor
              heterostructure.  The error distributions and decoherence properties of these
              electrons are being calculated, and it appears that correlated errors and
              mutual decoherence are important in this dot implementation.  The impact of
              these phenomena on quantum algorithms and quantum error correction schemes is
              being investigated.  This is done by examining their effect in two paradigmatic
              quantum processes.  The first is the quantum random walk, a simple example of
              an algorithm that can be implemented on a one- or two-dimensional array of
              quantum dot qubits.  The second is the computation of the majority function. A
              particularly attractive feature of both problems is that it is interesting and
              feasible to do them in cases that require relatively few qubits.  More general
              questions are also being addressed.  Certain types of quantum algorithms will
              be more susceptible to certain types of errors.  This leads to the possibility
              of quantum error-resistant algorithms, and the feasibility of this
              generalization of the similar classical concept is being determined.
