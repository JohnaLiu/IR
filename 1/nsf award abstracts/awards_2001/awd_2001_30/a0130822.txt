              Computers: An in vitro, in abstractio, and in silico study

Ultimately,
              nanotechnology will enable us to design programmable information processors
              (computers) from the ground up, growing them from molecules. The brain is built
              in this fashion through the power of epigenesis multicellular differentiation
              triggered by environmental signals. Despite impressive progress in our
              understanding of this process (Sanes, Reh et al. 2000), no one has attempted to
              design a computer that learns by growing based on insights from neurobiology.
              Using information derived from in vitro and in abstractio studies of diffusible
              neurotrophic factor mediated neuronal pathfinding (growth-cone chemotaxis) and
              synaptogenesis, we will develop a self-configurable computer that reprograms
              itself at the level of individual connections by merging custom, very large
              scale integration, in silico microtechnology with growing virtual wires. With
              the insights gained in this project, we will be poised to take advantage of
              real anatomical plasticity made possible by rapid progress in nanotechnology.
