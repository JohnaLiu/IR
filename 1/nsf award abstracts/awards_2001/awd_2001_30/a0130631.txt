Partial funding is awarded towards the purchase of a new
              generation multi-collector Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer (TIMS), which
              permits ultra-high precision measurements of positively and negatively charged
              ion beams.  The Dartmouth College will provide a match consisting of 50% of the
              expected cost of the instrument.  The TIMS instrument will be the primary
              research tool in the new radiogenic isotope geochemistry laboratory in the
              Department of Earth Sciences. Ultra-high precision osmium and neodymium
              isotopic ratios will be determined using the new TIMS with the aim of
              addressing issues related to the origin and evolution of Earth and other
              planetary reservoirs. In addition, high sensitivity measurements of rhenium,
              osmium, iridium, samarium, neodymium, uranium, thorium, lead, rubidium,
              strontium, and iron isotopes will be performed. The new TIMS facility will
              provide an exciting new dimension to research at Dartmouth, complementing the
              extant strong research programs in the Department of Earth Sciences, which
              include K-Ar geochronology, organic geochemistry and paleoceanography,
              hydrogeochemistry of watersheds, climate change, landscape evolution,
              stratigraphy and basin analysis, hydrology and geomechanics, and tectonics.
              Many of these programs have a radiogenic isotope component and require access
              to a state-of-the-art TIMS facility. Additionally, other researchers and
              students at Dartmouth and in New England region will be able to use the new
              facility, resulting in further growth of research and education in geochemistry
              and in physical sciences.
