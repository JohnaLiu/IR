CISE Research Resources: 
              A Low Cost Parallel and Distributed Systems Laboratory

The proposed project
              includes three parallel applications on a Beowulf cluster. The chief advantage
              of a Beowulf cluster is its superb price/performance ratio: the proposed
              cluster will obtain performance in the 3-5 Gigaflop range, for less than one
              tenth the cost of a comparably powered supercomputer. The low cost parallel and
              distributed systems laboratory consists of a 16-node Beowulf cluster. Each node
              is similar to an off-the-shelf PC without a monitor or keyboard.  The nodes are
              networked by 100 Mbit Fast Ethernet lines.  Each node will run both Linux and
              Windows/NT. 

Three parallel applications are proposed: (1) A parallel system
              for ecological modeling, with its focus on minimizing the simulation time of
              parallelized ecological models. A central component will be porting NOAA's
              NNT-SMS rectilinear parallel modeling package to the Beowulf architecture, (2)
              A Java runtime framework on Beowulf clusters for parallel execution of
              multithreaded processes. A new lottery-based job stealing algorithm will be
              studied for efficient scheduling of large-scale multithreaded computation. (3)
              Optimal configuration selection for accuracy enhancement of programmable
              machines.  A genetic algorithm solution will be studied to enhance the accuracy
              of programmable machines.  The success of this project will demonstrate the
              usefulness of Beowulf clusters as a cost-effective alternative to the
              supercomputer.
