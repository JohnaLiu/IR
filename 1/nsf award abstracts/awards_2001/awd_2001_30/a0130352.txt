Abstract    :
              EIA-0130352-Robert Kozma-University of Memphis-Percolation Model of Phase
              Transitions in the Central Nervous Systems during Perceptual Information
              Processing 

The proposed research will explore the close link between
              pattern-based information processing using dynamical memories and percolation
              phenomena.  Percolation models have been used to analyze a wide range of
              processes in physics and electronics, and in biological and ecological systems.
                In the last decade and a half, many variants of the standard percolation
              models have been studied.  In particular, there has been much work on the
              family or processes known as bootstrap percolation.  Computer experiments
              performed by physicists have suggested interesting non-trivial models.  The
              solid mathematical theory of percolation in lattices to lay down the
              foundations of dynamical memories and the related phase transitions will be
              applied.
