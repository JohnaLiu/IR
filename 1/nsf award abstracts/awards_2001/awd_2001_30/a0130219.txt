Abstract    :
              This project by a doctoral student of anthropology investigates how industrial
              workers and managers in a post-socialist setting (the Czech Republic) pursue
              strategies which impact the economic "transition" to fully capitalist forms of
              enterprise. Through surveys, interviews, and as an employee in the factory
              setting, the student will collect the data needed to analyze the processes
              whereby groups of workers come to think about their work and organize
              themselves, and how these, in turn, affect processes and goals within specific
              enterprises. The research will also document the political processes among
              workers and identify how power and authority are exercised within the factory. 
              This research will contribute to the body of theory regarding industrial work
              in different cultures and will provide practical approaches to enterprise
              management as well as valuable insight to business ventures in the region.
