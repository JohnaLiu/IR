This
              award supports participants in the conference on Singularity Formation in
              Nonlinear Evolution Equations held at Iowa State University on June 8-9, 2002. 
              The conference emphasizes recent progress in the theory of singularity
              formation in nonlinear partial differential equations. The focus is mainly on
              three topics: singular solutions of systems of partial differential equations,
              critical exponent phenomena in nonlinear parabolic and hyperbolic equations,
              and effects of damping and convection.

An issue of fundamental importance in
              the mathematical theory of evolution equations is that of singularity
              formation. Analysis of this phenomenon can be essential for understanding the
              physical processes being modeled. One might very roughly divide the subject
              into three categories: regularity theory (proofs that singularities do not
              occur), propagation and interaction of singularities results (proofs that
              singularities persist in some respect) and theory of singularity formation
              (proofs that singularities must occur, and behavior of solutions near singular
              points). It is this last topic which is the main theme of the proposed
              conference, which will provide an excellent opportunity for communication and
              collaboration among faculty and between senior and junior investigators.
