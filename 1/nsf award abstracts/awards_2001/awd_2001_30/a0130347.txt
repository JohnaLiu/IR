Abstract    :
              This project examines microenvironmental causes of developmental instability.
              This project hypothesizes that developmental instability results in part from
              the sensitivity of metabolism and development to (generally unmeasured)
              micro-environmental variation This project tests the hypothesis that trait
              sensitivities to small-scale changes in environmental conditions will explain a
              significant fraction of developmental instability.  Thirty five ecotypes of
              Arabidopsis thaliana will be grown in controlled environmental conditions. Each
              plant will experience one of four macro-scale environments: High Light
              (HL)/High Nitrogen (HN); HL/LowNitrogen(LN); LowLight (LL)/HN; LL/LN.  Within
              these macroenvironments, each plant will receive a slight increase or decrease
              in light or nitrogen relative to the macro-scale target levels.  Using a
              quantitative genetics approach, the comparison of 1) the sensitivity of trait
              measurements to small changes in environmental conditions and 2) the extent of
              developmental instability, will test the hypothesis.   

Developmental
              instability is thought to play a number of important roles in the processes by
              which organisms adapt to changing environments.  Perhaps most importantly,
              developmental instability obscures the roles of genes in the variation between
              individuals.  For crop breeding, this means that the response to selection for
              economically important traits is reduced.  In natural populations,
              developmental instability reduces the abilty of the organism to both maintain a
              stable phenotype, and to adapt to changing environments.
