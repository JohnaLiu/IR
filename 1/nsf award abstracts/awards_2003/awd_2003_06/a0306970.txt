Abstract

This collaborative project supports travel of new
              researchers from US institutions to two international conferences in Statistics
              during the summer of 2003. The conferences are the International Environmetrics
              Society (TIES) 2003 Conference, held in August 2003 in Beijing, China, and the
              International Statistics Institute (ISI) Conference on Environmental Statistics
              and Health (ISI-ESH), held in July 2003 in Santiago de Compostela, Spain. The
              conferences provide a forum for these new researchers to present their work and
              interact with established researchers in statistics who work on environmental
              and health related scientific issues.
