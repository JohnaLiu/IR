Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI will investigate several different aspects of
              the
theory of linear partial differential equations associated to
              manifolds
with singular Riemannian metrics.  These include the propagation
              and
diffraction of singularities for the wave equation on manifolds with
              conic
and edge singularities, and the structure of the fundamental solution
              for
the time-dependent Schrodinger equation on manifolds with
              scattering
metrics.  Tools such as the Fourier-Bros-Iagolnitzer transform will
              be
studied and refined as needed.

Linear partial differential equations
              (PDEs) that describe wave propagation
(such as the classical wave equation and
              the Schrodinger equation) are of
fundamental importance in physics and
              geometry.  The propagation of waves
on curved spaces often involves the
              geometry of the underlying space in a
subtle manner.  When the space is
              `singular,' either in the sense of being
infinite in extent or of having
              degenerate properties in a finite region,
the relationship between geometry
              and the properties of solutions to PDEs
is especially fascinating and poorly
              understood.
