Abstract    :
              The P.I. is requesting support to hold a workshop on the astrophysics of
              gravitational wave sources at the University of Maryland Conference Center
              during the period April 24, 2003 to April 26, 2003. The meeting will focus on
              the astrophysics of anticipated gravitational wave sources and the scenarios
              that surround them. Invited papers and poster sessions will address theoretical
              studies of these sources. The workshop will play an essential role in
              stimulating and facilitating the interactions among those in the community
              doing gravitational wave research and pushing forward the boundaries of that
              science.
