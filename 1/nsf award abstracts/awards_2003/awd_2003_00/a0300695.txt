Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to determine thermal and gas regimes of
              landfills and to establish correlations between the measured parameters and
              operational and environmental conditions at landfills.  It involves
              collaboration between Wayne State University and Lawrence Technological
              University, and various industrial partners.  Three landfills, located in
              Michigan, New Mexico, and Alaska, have previously been instrumented and plans
              include instrumenting an additional site located in British Columbia,
              Canada.

The project has three components: monitoring existing sensors,
              installing additional sensors, and analyzing data.  Temperature and gas data
              are collected in the waste mass, liner systems, and the surrounding soils. 
              This data will be used to generate an extensive database for use by researchers
              and practitioners.  Comprehensive correlations between landfill byproducts
              (heat, gas, and leachate generation) and operational and environmental
              conditions will be developed.  These correlations will provide tools for
              improving the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice of waste disposal and
              containment in landfills
