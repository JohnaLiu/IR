Abstract    :
              The Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS) promotes, administers,
              and provides support services for the conference series known as the NSF/CBMS
              Regional Research Conferences in Mathematics.  Each year approximately six
              conferences will be held. These conferences are intended to stimulate interest
              and activity in mathematical research. Each five day conference features a
              distinguished  lecturer who delivers ten lectures on a topic of important
              current research in one sharply focused area of the mathematical sciences.
              Support for about 30 participants is provided and the conference organizer
              invites both established researchers and interested newcomers, including
              postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, to attend. The lecturer
              subsequently prepares an expository monograph based upon the lectures and this
              is published as a part of a regional conference series.  Depending upon the
              conference topic, the monograph is published by the American Mathematical
              Society, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, or jointly by the
              American Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. 
              These conferences have been an ongoing cooperative project administered by CBMS
              and supported by NSF for the last 34 years. A complete listing of all past
              conferences and their resulting monographs is given on the CBMS website
              www.cbmsweb.org.
