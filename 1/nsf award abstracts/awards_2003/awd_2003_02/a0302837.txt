Abstract    :
              Potential flow approximation or assuming zero vorticity does not necessarily
              require making an inviscid approximation.  In most cases, the effect of
              viscosity in potential flow is negligible and not important.  However, in the
              cases outlined by the PI, the viscous effect may have subtle but significant
              consequences.  The Pi has pioneered the investigation of what he refers to as
              the viscous potential flow.

This work will be important in cavitation of
              liquids near capillary collapse (the phenomena under active investigation in
              the physics community), supercavitation and stress induced cavitation, and
              other areas such at acoustic effects.
