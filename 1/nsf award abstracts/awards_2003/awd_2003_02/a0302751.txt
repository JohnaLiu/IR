Abstract    :
              A consortium of six Washington DC metropolitan community colleges (Prince
              George's
Community College, Northern Virginia Community College, Howard
              Community College, Montgomery College, Frederick Community College, and Lord
              Fairfax Community College) and the Virginia Community College System Institute
              for Excellence for Information Technology, joined by three universities (Johns
              Hopkins University, G W Solutions - a George Washington University Enterprise,
              and University of Maryland College Park), Eleanor Roosevelt High School,
              CompTIA, CISCO, and a number of private sector and government enterprises are
              collaborating in developing a Strategic Plan for a NSF-ATE Washington area
              regional cybersecurity center. The goals of the planning period fall into four
              broad areas: 1) to gather information on special regional needs and existing
              education and training; 2) to share curriculum and course information about
              existing courses and seek information on cybersecurity courses and curricula at
              other community colleges; 3) to begin professional development activities; and
              4) to begin the process of creating seamless pathways from high schools,
              through the community colleges, to four-year institutions.
