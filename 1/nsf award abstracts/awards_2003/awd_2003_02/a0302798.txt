Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to hold a unique, interdisciplinary workshop on Arctic
              anthropology by bringing together some of the most prominent researchers in
              North America to synthesize their work of the last 4 decades.  At the
              workshop's conceptual core is the recognition of the scientific contributions
              of Dr. Allen McCartney whose own research has crossed the Arctic from the
              Atlantic to the Pacific coasts of North America and spanned over 4 decades.   
              

With great support from the Arctic anthropology research community, the PI
              has presented a compelling case for bringing together seasoned scientists,
              novice researchers, and students to discuss the groundbreaking contributions of
              Allen McCartney in the areas of: Thule whaling and climate change; Bowhead
              whales in Thule and Inupiat society and culture; Thule archeology conservation;
              Archeological phases of the Aleutian Islands; Aleut Eskimo interface; Maritime
              cultural adaptations.

This workshop will have significant impacts in the
              field as well as for Arctic residents who are actively researching their past.
