Abstract    :
              A Bayesian framework will be used to compare interspecies gene expression data
              in order to reconstruct gene regulatory networks for the species considered. 
              Considering multiple species simultaneously should lead to more accurate,
              complete network models and facilitate the understanding of evolutionary
              relationships between components sharing common function across species.  The
              knowledge of yeast networks will be used to generate hypotheses for networks
              that model human networks.   Global gene expression data in response to DNA
              damaging agents will be compared as a first instance of the analysis tools. 
              Impact:  The ability to compare expression data across species will contribute
              to our understanding of systems biology and can also be applied to the
              comparison of different cell and tissue types as well as species.  This may
              have applications in development and health sciences.
