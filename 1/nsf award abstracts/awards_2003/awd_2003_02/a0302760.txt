Abstract    :
              The EU-US Task Force on Environmental Biotechnology obtained one-time support
              for short-term transatlantic exchanges of early career scientists designed to
              foster collaborative interactions and enhance the professional development of
              the exchange fellows through the acquisition of expertise in microbial
              biotechnology. Eleven participants have completed exchange experiences in EU
              laboratories. These experiences have generated much enthusiasm for the program
              and requests for its continuation.
Collaborations and publications are now in
              the planning stages. As a result of this momentum, we are seeking a renewal of
              the grant funding to support a similar number of new exchange fellows in the
              coming year.
