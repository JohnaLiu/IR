This proposal requests travel support for 16 students from
              U.S. universities in the Student Paper Competition at the 2003 International
              Microwave Symposium (IMS). The IMS is the annual meeting of the Microwave
              Theory and Techniques Society (MTT-S) of the Institute of Electrical and
              Electronics Engineers, Inc. (IEEE). The IMS is also the major international
              conference in the microwave field and a focus of research results in wireless
              communications. In 2003, the IMS will be held in Philadelphia, PA, USA from
              June 8 to June 13.

Each year, the MTT-S promotes student education and
              research in microwave theory and techniques through a number of mechanisms. One
              of the most important mechanisms is the Student Paper Competition at the IMS.
              This selective program brings the world's best students together in an
              integrated program in which they present their work not only to a technical
              audience but also to a group of judges. The program helps develop the students'
              technical acumen as well as their communication skills. It also helps introduce
              them to the international technical community and helps to build a community of
              students
who will lead the next generation of microwave professionals.

The
              IMS provides financial support of various forms but does not reimburse travel
              expenses. Travel support from NSF will ensure that the program is open to the
              widest range of interested applicants from U.S. universities.
