Abstract    :
              U.S. National Committee for the International Union for Quaternary
              Research
Travel Grant Program to the XVI Congress
Reno, NV
July 23-31,
              2003


Under the terms of Master Agreement No. 0239568, the National Academy
              of Sciences requests funds for Support of Travel to the XVI International Union
              for Quaternary Research (INQUA) Congress.  The work will be conducted by the
              U.S. National Committee for the INQUA (USNC/INQUA), a committee of the Board on
              International Scientific Organizations in the Policy and Global Affairs
              Division.  The objective of this travel grant program is to assist U.S.
              graduate students in attending the Congress in Reno, NV and to inspire the
              enthusiasm of U.S. Quaternary students, individually and collectively, by
              encouraging their substantive face-to-face interaction with the world
              Quaternary community.  This travel grant program of $19,245, will subsidize the
              travel of approximately 30 U.S. graduate students, and a small amount of staff
              time to create, receive, and handle travel grant applications; to distribute
              the awards; and to collect the post-meeting reports.
