Abstract    :
              
Identifying the mechanisms that structure local communities is a fundamental
              goal of community
ecology. Historically, ecologists invoked local processes to
              explain community structure, but
equivocal evidence has broadened debate to
              include the potential importance of regional
processes in structuring
              communities. Though experimentation has proven critical in resolving
issues in
              ecology, theoretical and observational studies have, thus far, been the primary
              tools used
to examine the effects of regional processes. I propose a series of
              novel experiments to test
theories that span the range between local and
              regional control of diversity. Local process,
metapopulation competition, and
              neutral community theories make predictions about the effects
of immigration
              that are qualitatively different, mutually exclusive, and testable in the
              same
immigration experiments. Using a laboratory system of Tribolium flour
              beetles and a field system
of Cecropia petiole beetles, I will experimentally
              test these theories by simultaneously
manipulating immigration regime and
              interaction strength (lab), and exposure to immigration and
distance from
              colonization source (field). Though recently developed theory suggests
              regional
processes can have a dominant effect on community structure, the
              theory must first be confirmed
empirically if community ecology is to gain
              insight from the regional process perspective.
