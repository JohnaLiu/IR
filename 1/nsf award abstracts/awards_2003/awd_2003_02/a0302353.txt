              Searching for Digital Government Research

This Small Grant for Exploratory
              Research will support exploration of the use of automated agents, or spiders,
              to gather web material related to the topic of digital government, and to
              explore the results of the agent's efforts in new ways to support analysis and
              knowledge discovery.  Since the topic of digital government is quite broad,
              this work presents a stiff challenge, but with a potentially large payoff. The
              PI will work with several current grantees of the NSF Digital Government
              Research Program.
