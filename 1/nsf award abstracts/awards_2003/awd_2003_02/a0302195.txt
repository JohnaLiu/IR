The Woman's Initiative Committee Session entitled
              "Advancement and Retention of Female Chemical Engineers: Issues and Strategies"
              will be held at the annual American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE)
              meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana.  It will be a full morning session from 8:30
              a.m. to 1:00 p.m. with speakers including women from industry, academia
              government.   Some of the presentations include:
	Keynote presentation by
              Karen Gleason discussing "Status of Women Faculty at MIT."
	Frankie Wood-Black
              from Phillips Petroleum Company detailing "Removing Barriers - PROGRESSing
              toward the Future."
	Kathleen Bartom from Pharmacia describing "Devine Secrets
              of the ChE Sisterhood: My 20 Years in Chemical Engineering."
	Diane Wolf from
              Kraft Foods will talk about "Networking Strategies."
	Catherine Didion will
              describe "AWIS: Institution Assessment Tools and Model Academic
              Policies."
	Regina Murphy from the University of Wisconsin will outline
              information about "A National Women in Science and Engineering Leadership
              Institute (WISELI)."
The presentations will be followed by a luncheon
              sponsored by corporate sponsor Kraft, hopefully to attract 50 to 75 chemical
              engineering professionals, faculty members and graduate students.

The
              session is a part of a more comprehensive program to help women at all stages
              of their careers - from graduate student to tenured faculty as well as women in
              various industrial positions in the chemical process industries - to advance in
              their careers.  NSF funds will be used for airfare, registration, hotel, and
              meal per diem for some of the speakers.
