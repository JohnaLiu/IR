Much of the
              signal-processing literature in the 20th Century focused on certain simplifying
              assumptions: Stationarity, Gaussianity, and linearity. The primary motivation
              for these assumptions is mathematical tractability. However, with the
              ever-increasing power and availability of computers, mathematical tractability
              is no longer the compelling issue that it used to be. Indeed, with powerful
              computers at hand, we can expand on the horizons of statistical signal
              processing to account for practical realities of nearly all physical phenomena
              encountered in practice, namely, nonstationarity, unknown statistics (typically
              nonGaussian), and nonlinearity. This expansion is one of the major goals of the
              2003 Workshop on "New Directions in Signal Processing for the 21st
              Century".

Another major goal of this unique Workshop is to bring two
              scientific communities closer together:

The signal processing community,
              which is still dominated by classical approaches to the solution of real-life
              problems; and, 

The neural computation community, which distinguishes itself
              by being motivated by the computing power of the human brain but lacks the
              attention that signal processing problems duly deserve.

With these two goals
              in mind, and by focusing on a carefully selected set of topics, the Workshop is
              assured of making a significant difference.
