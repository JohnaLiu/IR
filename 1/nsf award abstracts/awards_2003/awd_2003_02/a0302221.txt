Title: Advances in Graph and

Abstract 

 This conference is intended to
              foster the mathematical issues that are important to present day graph theory,
              along the lines pioneered by Prof. W. T. Tutte and continued by G. Neil
              Robertson and his coworkers.  As such, fundamental topics in graph theory like
              connectivity, surface and spatial embeddings, well-quasi-ordering, chromatic
              theory, infinite excluded minors, and directed graphs find common links through
              their structural features.  Moreover, within the conference framework the
              organizers intend to include close subjects such as matroid theory and  ties
              through polynomial-time graph algorithms to combinatorial optimization and
              computational complexity.

Large-scale practical computational problems such
              as job scheduling, transportation networks, and data encryption for the purpose
              of secured secret communication can often be formulated as problems in the
              branch of mathematics called graph theory.  Graph coloring problems are of
              particular practical interest.  The structure theory of graphs developed by
              Robertson and Seymour has solved important problems with practical applications
              in these areas.  This conference will bring together experts to foster
              interaction and advances in research of problems of graph theory and a related
              theory called matroid theory
