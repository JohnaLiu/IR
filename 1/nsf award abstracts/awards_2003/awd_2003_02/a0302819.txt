Abstract    :
              The Forest and Wood Products Institute at Mount Wachusett Community College, in
              partnerships with the leading researchers and policy makers in renewable
              biomass energy technologies, is establishing  a technician training program in
              this field. The Institute has recently converted the College's all-electric
              campus to a biomass heating system. This biomass system at the College serves
              as the focal point for the project. The goal of this project is to establish a
              biomass technology demonstration site in the Northeastern United States where
              industry and government decision-makers, students, and educators can learn
              about renewable biomass energy technologies. A long-term goal of the Institute
              is to produce replicable undergraduate curriculum for development of skilled
              workers in emerging renewable biomass energy technologies and policies.
              Specific activities for this one-year period include: expanding relationships
              to include new partners in the development of biomass energy; developing
              support among State and Federal agencies involved in renewable energy
              technology and policy; and creating an Advisory Board of regional and national
              stakeholders in the field.
