Abstract    :
              Professor Jeffrey A. Cina, of the University of Oregon Eugene, is supported to
              perform research on the theory of wavepacket interferometry and relaxation
              dynamics.   Theoretical support for the emerging field of ultrafast
              spectroscopy is required to aid in reconstructing molecular motion that may be
              inferred from measurement.   A feature of this work is that the
              information-rich time-dependent molecular wavefunction, rather than probability
              density, is ultimately determined.  Applications of the method are aimed at
              understanding quantum-state entanglement which is currently an issue of
              importance to quantum computing, electronic energy transfer which is a key step
              in photosynthesis, and chemical dynamics in solid materials and condensed-phase
              environments. 

The ability to spectrographically determine processes in and
              properties of large molecules has been limited until recently. The methods
              developed here allow one to significantly enhance capabilities for watching
              molecular motions and are particularly well suited to the size regime relevant
              to biological processes and quantum dots.  Understanding gleaned from such work
              may impact the development and control of biologically inspired molecular
              materials for use in catalysis, energy storage and quantum information
              technologies.
