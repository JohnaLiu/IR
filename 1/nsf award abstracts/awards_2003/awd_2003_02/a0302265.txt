Abstract    :
              The dynamics group in the Department of Mathematics at the University of
              Maryland, College Park, seeks support for a dynamics conference in spring of
              the years 2004, 2005 and 2006.  This represents our half of the Semi-annual
              Workshop in Dynamical Systems and Related Topics, cosponsored for the last 12
              years by the dynamics groups of Maryland and Penn State.  The organizers will
              rotate among the dynamics group, including K. Berg, M. Boyle, M. Brin, D.
              Dolgopyat, B. Hunt, M. Jakobson, D. Rudolph, and J. Yorke. Each year 2 or 3 of
              us will organize the meeting.

The goals of this conference are to promote
              the communication of mathematical results; to facilitate interaction and
              progress in dynamical systems and related fields; to nurture the sense of
              community and common mission in these fields; and to contribute to the training
              of graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients and to their integration into
              the dynamics community.
