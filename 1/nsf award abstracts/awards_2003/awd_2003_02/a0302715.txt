Abstract    :
              
Recent financial scandals, from fraudulent accounting at Enron and WorldCom to
              stock analysts on Wall Street, all involve conflicts of interest of some type. 
              Conflicts of interest can introduce a host of corruptions, biases and
              inefficiencies into the market. Preventing or reducing these negative effects
              depends crucially on understanding how conflicts of interest operate. We
              propose a conference that attracts scholars from a wide variety of disciplines
              and backgrounds, all of whom are doing research on conflict of interest.  The
              potential contribution of the conference is great, given the breadth and
              importance of the topic, the interest in the topic in diverse scholarly
              domains, and the opportunity to connect people across disciplines.

The goals
              of this conference are (1) to bring together people working on conflict of
              interest in a forum that fosters the efficient synthesis of a new body of
              knowledge; (2) to showcase research on conflicts of interest; (3) to define
              future research areas on the topic; and (4) to disseminate research findings
              about conflicts of interest, their dangers, and their solutions.

The
              conference will be held at Carnegie Mellon University in September, 2003. The
              organizers plan to publish the papers presented at the conference in a special
              edited book.
