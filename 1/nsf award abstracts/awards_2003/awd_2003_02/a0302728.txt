Abstract    :
              Abstract - CTS-9733830  Hermanson, James C.      The breakup and vaporization of
              liquid droplets in a high-speed gas stream occurs in two-phase flows, spray
              drying, rocket nozzle flow, liquid fuel injection, and steam turbine blade
              erosion.  Considerable practical advantages in many applications could be
              realized if high levels of dispersion and rapid mixing were achieved.  One
              technique is that of flash vaporization which involves violent disruption and
              vaporization of superheated liquids.  Most of the extant literature is focussed
              on incompressible flows and is not applicable to compressible flows, which are
              found in supersonic combustors.  The physics of superheated liquid droplet
              disruption, vaporization, and fuel/air mixing are not well established.    The
              proposed research program is a comprehensive, experimental investigation of the
              fundamental physics of superheated liquid fuel disruption and vaporization in
              supersonic flow, where the entire volume of the droplet is brought to a high
              level of superheat to promote flash vaporization.  This work will be a first
              step towards achieving a fundamental understanding of the behavior of
              superheated liquid fuel sprays in compressible flow, with particular attention
              paid t the different instability mechanism which affect the droplet history. 
              Droplets will be injected into a supersonic stream and their acceleration and
              subsequent vaporization will be examined primarily by planar laser-induced
              fluorescence and laser-spark schlieren/shadowgraphs.
