Abstract    :
              This proposal is a request for support to help cover the costs of organizing the
              Davis meeting on Cosmic Inflation.  It will take place from March 22-25, 2003
              in Davis California on the University of California Davis Campus. The funds
              will be used entirely to support graduate students who otherwise could not
              afford to attend the meeting.
