Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop new computational methods for
              protein structure prediction that are based on all-atom physics based models,
              with the specific goal of providing new computational tools to investigate the
              structural mechanisms of cellular regulation.  All though there are numerous
              examples of all-atom physical chemical models that are being used to elucidate
              the function of specific proteins, such models currently play a very limited
              role in predictive modeling. From the standpoint of algorithmic development,
              the central emphasis is on the implementation of new sampling methods, which
              complement molecular dynamics, for efficiently exploring the energetic
              landscape of a protein starting from a suitable initial guess (for example,
              homology model), and on the validation and refinement of energetic models for
              protein structure prediction.  Specific applications include homology modeling
              of kinases, the prediction of structural/dynamical changes due to
              phosphorylation, and prediction of the packing arrangements of multi-domain
              proteins.
