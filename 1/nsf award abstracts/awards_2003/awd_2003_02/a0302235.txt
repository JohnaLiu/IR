Abstract    :
              This NSF Workshop, being held on Oct. 21-22, 2002, will serve the dual purpose
              of: (a) reviewing the research accomplishments of the first year of the NSF
              01-65 Program, and (b) identifying future research needs and opportunities that
              may serve as the basis for a follow-on Initiative on this topic in FY 2003. A
              portion of the invited presentations will specifically draw in new communities
              to the Workshop that may be represented in a subsequent new Program
              Initiative.

The first day of the Workshop will consist of: (1) a plenary
              presentation that will set the tone of the developing research area, (2) 19
              grantee presentations (15 min. each) that will review the research results of
              the first year of the program and will discuss broad issues that may not relate
              to their own research interests, (3) approximately 5 invited presentations (30
              min. each) that come from NSF Directorates other than ECS and that will deal
              with new challenges and opportunities in this important area, and (4) a dinner
              speaker on industrial technology roadmaps. The second day will be dedicated to
              approximately four breakout discussion sessions, details of writing the final
              report, and issues related to a subsequent NSF Program Initiative that will be
              a follow-on to NSF 01-65. The Workshop will allow time to address important new
              research challenges and breakthrough technologies, especially those not fully
              addressed in the first program announcement.

The location for the workshop
              will be the Hyatt Regency Crystal City in Arlington, VA.  We expect to have
              approximately 80 participants, with 65 coming from academia and industry and
              the remainder coming from government.  Specifically, this proposal addresses:
              (1) a description and rationale for the workshop, (2) a list of potential
              speakers to be considered, (3) a list of the NSF 01-65 grantees, (4) a
              tentative agenda, (5) a proposed Workshop budget, (6) website material from the
              2000 Workshop, and (6) the actual NSF 01-65 Program Solicitation.

The
              Workshop will explore research opportunities in critical enabling technologies,
              with the goal of assuring continued bandwidth and capacity growth in optical
              communication systems and networks throughout the next 10 years. The Workshop
              will address forward-looking and high-impact research. Moreover, the workshop
              will explore how the NSF can play a strategic role in alleviating the workforce
              issues in a troubled optical communications industry. The final report prepared
              by the Workshop participants will detail important challenges, both fundamental
              and technological, that are likely to be at the forefront of this field for
              many years to come.
