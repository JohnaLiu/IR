The
              next Great Lakes Geometry Conference will be held May 1 - 4,
2003 at the
              University of Wisconsin-Madison. This is an
international conference held
              annually in the Midwest region,
rotating among different universities. The aim
              of this conference
will be to introduce the latest developments in the field
              of
geometric analysis and some closely related areas.  A partial
list of
              topics which will be covered by this conference include:
(Kaehler-) Einstein
              equation and constant scalar curvature metric
equation (Yamabe problem);
              (Hermitian-) Yang-Mills equation;
minimal surface equation; harmonic map
              problem and J- holomorphic
curves (Cauchy-Riemann equation); and the geodesic
              equation in
the infinite dimensional space of Kaehler metrics which is
              given
by a homogenous complex Monge-Ampere equation.  These equations
fit
              together with the corresponding evolution equations:
(Kaehler-) Ricci flow,
              Yang-Mills flow, the mean curvature flow,
and the harmonic map flow, etc.
              People would like to know (local
and global) existence, regularity and
              uniqueness of solutions to
these equations.  Many deep works have arisen by
              studying
different aspects of these challenging problems.

Differential
              geometry is a fundamental and vital field of
mathematics which has many far
              reaching applications beyond the
realm of pure mathematics. To name a few: the
              study of Kaehler
geometry, especially Calabi-Yau manifolds, has
              important
applications in theoretical physics; the study of (inverse)
              mean
curvature flow has important applications in image processing;
and the
              study of curves, surfaces and their higher-dimensional
analogues have
              important applications in computer graphics,
engineering and
              optimization.
