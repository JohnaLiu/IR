Abstract    :
              DIMACS, the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science,
              will run a workshop entitled "Software Security."  The workshop is aimed at
              providing leadership to the field of information security by bringing together
              in a single forum experts from a variety of relevant fields to assess the
              current state of the art, identify research needs, and establish directions for
              collaborative future work.  The workshop will investigate building secure
              software, including topics such as software risk managment, programming
              languages and platforms, auditing software, design for security, security
              flaws, and testing for security.  The workshop will also investigate
              application security, including topics such as sandboxing code, protection
              against malicious code, locking down executables, monitoring programs as they
              run, enforcing software use policy with technology, and dealing with extensible
              systems.
