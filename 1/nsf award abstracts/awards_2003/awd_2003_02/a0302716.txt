Abstract    :
               
The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) is held yearly
              at 
different locations in the world. The 2003 ISIT will be held from June 29
              . July 4, 2003, 
at the Pacific Convention Plaza, Yokohama, Japan.  The
              expected attendance, based on 
the experience of recent ISIT.s, is 750.850
              technical delegates from more than 25 
countries. About one-third of these
              attendees are expected to be graduate students, and 
many more will be recent
              graduates and new assistant professors.  
 
This proposal requests support
              for the travel expenses of ISIT participants from the U.S.  
These
              participants would be individuals whose papers have been selected for
              presentation 
at the Symposium, but who lack funds and would not be able to
              attend without travel 
support. The total amount requested is $30,000, based
              on a total of 20- 30 grants of 
$1000-$1500 each.
