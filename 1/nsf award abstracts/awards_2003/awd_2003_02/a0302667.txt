This award to University Hawaii at Manoa provides support for
              the acquisition of a 38 kHz, deep-profiling acoustic current profiler to be
              installed on R/V Kilo Moana.  It also supports the lease, with option to
              purchase, a new, digital nutrient analyzer for determining concentration levels
              of ammonium, nitrate, silicate, nitrite and phosphate in seawater samples. 
              This instrument is expected to be used on Kilo Moana and other UNOLS research
              vessels, as well as in a laboratory on the University of Hawaii campus when not
              at sea.  It is expected that the robustness of the instrument for shipboard
              operation and its overall performance will be evaluated during the lease
              period, and results provided to NSF and other oceanographic researchers for
              intercomparison with existing systems.  These acquisitions should provide a
              substantial advantage to marine scientists in their research during 2003 and
              future years.
