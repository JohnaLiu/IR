This award funds technical assistance to the NSF Major
              Research Instrumentation (MRI) program by providing planning, logistical, and
              administrative support for an MRI proposal-writing workshop targeted at the 32
              tribal colleges throughout the United States.  Guided by the expertise of
              chosen exemplars, the workshop will provide an overview of the MRI
              proposal-writing process, a guide to key proposal evaluation criteria, and
              hands-on instruction intended to maximize the success of an institution's
              submitted proposal.  The ultimate goals of the workshop are to increase the
              number of proposals submitted to the MRI program by U.S. tribal colleges in FY
              2004 and to increase the competitiveness of the tribal colleges' proposals
              within the overall submission pool.
