This award supports 18 American students to travel to Seoul,
              Korea to participate with counterpart British and Korean students in the final
              phase of a graduate level global product development course.  The University of
              Michigan, in collaboration with Oxford University and Seoul National
              University, manages the course.  During the semester, students work in
              multi-national teams to design, develop and manufacture a product for the
              global market.  The projects and the course are completed during face-to-face
              interactions of the student project teams.  This project is developing a
              holistic approach to the development of products for multiple markets and
              helping to prepare a globally engaged U.S. engineering workforce.
