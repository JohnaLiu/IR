Abstract    :
              This proof-of-concept project involves designing, building and testing a
              prototype autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (AUAV).  This award (phase 1) is
              for building and testing the prototype AUAV.  The prototype will have a 5 kg
              payload capacity and a maximum range of about 200 km.  If this prototype is
              successful, funds will be sought for a phase II AUAV to be supported through a
              separate grant proposal.  The phase II AUAV will have a range of 3-4 thousand
              km and a payload capacity of about 10 kg.

Should it succeed, the broader
              benefits that will result from this project include a new relatively
              inexpensive, robust observing platform and light weight miniaturized
              instruments for measuring radiation (albedo) and cloud and aerosol properties
              that will be available to the atmospheric/climate research communities. 
              Regarding educational impacts, hands-on student/postdoctoral activities will
              provide excellent cross-training opportunities between engineering and
              atmospheric instrument scientists.  In addition, the observing platform to be
              developed has potential for use by a broad array of researchers in the
              geosciences, including for ocean and land surface monitoring.
