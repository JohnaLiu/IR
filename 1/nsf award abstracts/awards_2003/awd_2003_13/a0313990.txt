Abstract    :
              This is an award for a workshop on "Coupling Theories of Learning and Research
              on Practice". The workshop will consist of three panels each focusing on a
              single position paper related to one of three conceptual learning theories for
              studying learning practices, participation/identity theory as developed in the
              writings of James Greeno, the dialogic theory of learning as duscussed in the
              writings of Jim Wertsch, and transactional inquire as described in the writings
              of Bill Clancey. The work of each panel will be threefold: to summarize a
              particular framework in such a way as to facilitate comparison, to demonstrate
              how the framework might be applied to the analysis of interaction within a
              concrete setting, and finally, to illuminate how the framework might contribute
              to a larger practice-based proram of research. The broader impact of this
              research will be in improved instructional practice grounded in strong theory
