Abstract    :
              This group proposes a research program involving collaboration with the HiRes
              cosmic ray project in Utah, and the ASPIRE K-12 outreach program which will
              expand to Montana. 
The HiRes experiment is designed to study high-energy
              enigmatic cosmic rays.  The observation of these cosmic rays whose energy
              exceeded the Greisen-Zetsepin-Kuz'min cut-off led many to postulate that some
              fundamental processes may be responsible for particles of extraordinary energy.
              
	Fly's Eye, supported by NSF, made the first and the most convincing
              observation of the highest energy of the enigmatic cosmic rays.  HiRes, the
              successor of Fly's Eye, is now in operation. 
	The Aspire Project
              (Astrophysics Science Project Integrating Research and Education) is an NSF
              supported outreach project involving HiRes scientists, K-12 teachers, state
              education administrators, education specialists, and programmers. The goal of
              this project is to infuse recent discoveries made in fundamental astrophysics
              research into everyday science lessons and laboratories by utilizing
              interactive, inquiry-oriented, web-based technology.
This project is an
              example of the NSF initiative of integrating research and education.
