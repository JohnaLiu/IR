Abstract    :
              The proposal requests funding for partial support for U.S. scientists to attend
              either of two sequential high energy physics conferences in Les Arcs, Savoie,
              France. The first conference (March 15-22, 2003) addresses Electroweak
              Interactions and Unified Theories. The subjects are CP violation in B and K
              systems, particle astrophysics, neutrino physics, tests of the Standard Model,
              searches for new particles and theories beyond the Standard Model.

The
              second conference (March 23-29, 2003) concerns Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and
              High Energy Hadronic Interactions. The topics to be covered include heavy
              flavor physics, structure functions, diffractive phenomena, low-x physics and
              saturation, tests of perturbative QCD, heavy ion collisions, the search for new
              phenomena and physics at future accelerators.
