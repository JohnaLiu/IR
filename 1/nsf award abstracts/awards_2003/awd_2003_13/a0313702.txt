Grant Title: Using Midazolam
              to Explore Implicit Memory

Experimental and neuropsychological studies have
              demonstrated that subjects often display a form of memory in which they are
              affected by prior experiences, even though they have no conscious memory of
              these experiences. This form of memory is often referred to as implicit memory.
              Unfortunately, attempts to understand the nature of implicit memory have been
              stymied by methodological problems. These problems include:  1) difficulties in
              studying implicit memory in memory-impaired patients because of interpretive
              problems posed by the numerous correlated conditions afflicting memory-impaired
              patients (e.g., a history of alcohol abuse); and 2) difficulties in studying
              implicit memory in normal participants because of interpretive problems posed
              when conscious memory contaminates performance on implicit memory tests.  The
              current project uses midazolam, a safe, short-acting amnesiac agent to study
              implicit memory. Midazolam renders participants amnesiac for a brief period
              (e.g., 5minutes),  allowing us to explore the nature of implicit memory
              independently of contamination by conscious memory in normal participants.  The
              proposed experiments use this technique to explore the capacity of implicit
              memory to represent meaningful information.  Understanding how implicit memory
              represents meaningful  information will help us understand the similarities and
              differences between the operating principles that govern conscious and implicit
              memory, as well as enrich our understanding of the factors that facilitate
              meaningful processing of information.
