Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for student and postdoc participation in the 2003
              Gordon Research Conference on Quantum Control of Light and Matter.  The field
              of Coherent Control has grown beyond the initial objectives of the control of
              uni-molecular processes to providing attractive strategies to solving
              scientific problems as well as paving the way  for new applications in a broad
              range of disciplines.  The objective of the conference is to bring together
              internationally leading scientists as well as young researchers and students
              active or specially interested in the field of quantum control.  The conference
              shall be a forum to present the newest research results and trends in this
              rapidly expanding field.  The interdisciplinary character of the field will be
              emphasized.
