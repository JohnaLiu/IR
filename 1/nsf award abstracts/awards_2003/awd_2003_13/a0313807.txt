Abstract    :
              This grant will partially support an international symposium on "Transmission
              Electron Microscopy and Catalysis"  to be held at the University of Delaware on
              April 11, 2003.  TEM instrumentation is undergoing dramatic changes that are
              significantly enhancing the potential applications of this key technique in
              catalysis research.  Electron sources, lenses, sample stages and detectors have
              been dramatically improved, and new approaches that couple imaging and
              spectroscopy will permit structural and chemical composition information to be
              obtained simultaneously.  In situ experimentation using sub-atmosphere
              pressures of reactive gases will bring TEM techniques closer to industrial
              catalytic reactor conditions.  The symposium will bring together a select group
              of highly recognized microscopists to present the leading experimental
              capabilities for TEM in heterogeneous catalysis research.  

The conference
              will involve exchange of scientific information by the TEM experts and
              participants from the heterogeneous catalysis community.  Principal
              investigators, graduate/undergraduate students, and industrial representatives
              will share perspectives and future research directions, including networking
              opportunities for collaboration.   A web site will be created to disseminate
              the symposium conclusions and presentations.
