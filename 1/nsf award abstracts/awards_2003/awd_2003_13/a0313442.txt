Abstract    :
              This grant will support the attendance of graduate students and young principal
              investigators at the 18th North American Meeting of the Catalysis Society to be
              held June 1-7, 2003 in Cancun, Mexico. The meetings of the Catalysis Society
              are held biannually and are the premier events for catalysis researchers in
              North America and throughout the world.  Symposium topics include recent
              advances in environmental catalysis and green chemistry, hydrotreating and
              heavy crude upgrading, catalysis by nanoparticles and nanostructures, metal and
              oxides, acid-base catalysis, homogeneous catalysis and single site
              polymerization, fuel cells, catalysis in organic synthesis, combinatorial
              catalysis, catalysts deactivation and reaction engineering, computational
              catalysis, biocatalysis, advances in catalyst preparation and characterization,
              and industrial catalysis.  The objective of this proposal is to defray meeting
              attendance costs, especially for graduate students and young investigators. 
              With co-funding from other sources, support for about 60 participants will be
              provided. Special emphasis will be placed on including a diverse group of young
              researchers in the awards. 

The conference will involve exchanges of
              scientific information by nearly 800-1000 investigators and 80-100 graduate
              students.  Students will benefit tremendously from the experience, and this
              grant will enable a diverse group of students to attend, including women and
              minorities from varied geographical locations in the United States.   The
              poster presentations and informal interactions permit students and young
              investigators to gain a much broader perspective of catalysis research and the
              importance of their own contributions.
