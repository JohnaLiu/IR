The project is about a planning visit for developing
              collaborative research work in developing collaborative research work in
              high-precision design and manufacturing with researchers at National Taiwan
              University in Taiwan. The proposed study would contribute to the advanced
              precision manufacturing, strengthening the research collaboration between U.S.
              and Taiwan in the subject area.
