This award supports planning and development of U.S.-Korea
              research cooperation in the area of intelligent sensor systems for robotic
              applications.  Dr. Sooyong Lee of Texas A&M University will facilitate the
              participation of five American graduate students in the East Asia Summer
              Institute- Korea program.  Each of the students will work during the summer in
              a Korean laboratory, thus gaining international research experience and setting
              the stage for future research collaborations.
