Abstract    :
              This project seeks to continue and extends investigations involving the
              energetics, dynamics, and variability of the low latitude atmosphere and
              ionosphere.  The very general goals are to test, evaluate, and improve the NCAR
              upper atmosphere models; to use the models to investigate the effects of lower
              atmosphere waves on the thermosphere and ionosphere; to (attempt to) resolve
              some discrepancies between the observed and modeled upper atmosphere/ionosphere
              temperatures; and to investigate several selected topics such as the midnight
              temperature maximum, the behavior of the ion drifts, and the development of
              large neutral winds in the lower thermosphere.

This project will continue
              the important task of validating the NCAR models, which are community resources
              with wide-ranging applications.  The region of interest, the tropical
              ionosphere, plays an important role in global communications and navigation and
              is a major focus for space weather research. The project will support the
              research of a female space scientist/physics faculty member along with a
              graduate student.
