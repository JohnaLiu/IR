Abstract    :
              
Savings allows households to smooth consumption and make investments.  Savings
              also helps stabilize banking markets and fuel economic growth.  Yet much
              remains unknown about the determinants of savings, particularly in developing
              countries.  Are low savings a consequence of low access to safe, affordable
              savings product, or do households also need mechanisms designed specifically to
              help them commit to save?

We are working with a rural bank in the
              Philippines to offer market-driven innovative savings devices with commitment
              features.  The project employs a rigorous experimental research design, with
              random assignment to treatment and control groups, in order to draw robust
              policy conclusions about the potential implications for expansion of these
              client-responsive products on overall economic outcomes for poor, rural
              Filipinos.  We will collect a full set of outcome variables so that we can
              measure not only changes in savings at the rural bank, but changes in aggregate
              household savings in both formal and
informal vehicles.  Furthermore, we will
              collect consumption and investment data so that we can observe how additional
              savings were or were not used, and lastly we will conduct in depth analysis of
              who decides to take-up the commitment savings products so that we can try to
              disentangle competing theories of savings behavior.
