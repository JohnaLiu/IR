Abstract    :
              	The 45th Annual Maize Genetics Conference will be held March 13-16, 2003.  The
              meeting offers members of the Maize Genetics community the opportunity to
              present and discuss their most recent research results. A wide range of topics
              are covered, ranging from classical to molecular genetics.  The meeting is an
              especially important venue for graduate students to meet and interact with
              scientists in the field, to discuss their research ideas as talks or posters,
              and to begin to establish the scientific networks that will prove invaluable
              throughout their careers. The 45th Annual meeting will feature 45-minute talks
              by five invited speakers, 15 minute talks given by individual participants, two
              poster sessions, and two workshops.  The invited speakers will be: Hugo Dooner,
              Rutgers University; Steve Henikoff, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center;
              Susan McCouch, Cornell University; Neelima Sinha, University of
              California-Davis; and Vicki Vance, University of South Carolina.  The workshops
              will be:  "Maize Genomics Resources" and "Maize Quantitative Trait Loci: 
              Practical Aspects and New Approaches".
	The annual Maize Genetics Conference
              offers members of the maize genetics community the opportunity to present and
              discuss research results in many areas of maize genetics and genomics.  The
              format of the meeting includes talks, poster sessions, and workshops. The
              Conference provides an outstanding venue for graduate students to meet and
              interact with scientists in the field, to discuss their research ideas as talks
              or posters, and to begin to establish the scientific networks that will prove
              invaluable throughout their careers.
