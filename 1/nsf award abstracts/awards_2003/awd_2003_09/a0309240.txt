Abstract    :
              Most theories on the evolution of parasite virulence assume a positive
              relationship between transmission success of the parasite and its virulence,
              but there are few experimental tests of this relationship. Understanding the
              degree to which the host, versus the parasite, controls transmission mode would
              contribute substantially to models of parasite evolution by testing this common
              assumption. This research exploits a variable plant-fungus interaction to
              explore the phenotypic and genetic relationships between virulence and
              transmission mode (horizontal or vertical). Experiments are planned to
              determine if horizontal transmission is positively related to parasite
              virulence, the relationship between horizontal transmission and vertical
              transmission, if parasite growth rate predicts transmission success or parasite
              virulence, and if the parasite or the host - or their interaction - controls
              the mode of parasite transmission. The proposed studies will provide empirical
              data on the relationship between parasite transmission mode and virulence,
              which is broadly applicable to human health and agriculture. The project will
              support the training and development of a non-traditional graduate student.
