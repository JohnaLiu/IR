Abstract    :
              This SGER award will allow the PI to take advantage of the immediate
              availability of a 50 MHz radar on Christmas Island (CXI) (Republic of Kiribati)
              to conduct a two-radar experiment to explore whether the development and
              characteristics of irregularities in the nighttime equatorial F region (known
              as equatorial spread F, or ESF) are correlated in longitude and time. The other
              radar, located on the island of Pohnpei (Federated States of Micronesia), is
              already in continuous operation, and data from measurements taken by that radar
              will be made available at no cost to the proposed effort.

Besides
              information about the timescales associated with the source process for ESF
              development, the database of backscatter plumes over two locations is expected
              to provide further insight into the source of ESF plume characteristics. Each
              data set will also provide, for the first time, descriptions of the seasonal
              and longitudinal dependences of ESF activity in those longitude sectors. The
              findings of this investigation are expected to pave the way toward developing a
              short-term forecasting capability for ESF development, a prime objective of the
              National Space Weather Program.
