Abstract    :
              Ecologists have long debated whether plant communities consist of interdependent
              and interacting species, or of individual, co-occurring species that are
              adapted to similar abiotic conditions. The proposed research addresses this
              question with respect to Pinus albicaulis, a rapidly declining keystone species
              of forests in the northern Rocky Mountains and North Cascade Ranges.
              Preliminary results show that understory plant species interact positively or
              negatively with P. albicaulis, and that these interactions may be mediated by
              soil conditions which are influenced both by fire and by plant species. The
              experiments proposed focus on determining the mechanisms responsible for
              facilitation of P. albicaulis in harsh subalpine conditions. Results will
              further scientific understanding of the mechanisms affecting plant community
              structure and will assist efforts to restore this keystone species.
