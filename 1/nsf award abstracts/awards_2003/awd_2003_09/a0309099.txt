Abstract    :
              Pathogens play an important role in the health, welfare, and survival of
              wildlife, agricultural, and human populations.  Only recently, however, has it
              become evident how quickly pathogens can change, rapidly developing drug
              resistance, adapting to new hosts, and becoming more (and less) virulent. 
              These changes may be predictable.  By understanding how traits beneficial to a
              pathogen (e.g., reproduction and transmission) are linked to potentially costly
              traits (like harming one's host), we may be able to explain how pathogens
              change under certain ecological conditions.  The proposed research will first
              examine the relationship between replication, transmission, and virulence,
              using a lethal virus of salamanders as a model system.  Then, using these
              relationships among traits, it will assess how this virus changes its level of
              virulence under conditions favoring or inhibiting transmission.  Understanding
              how and why virulence changes over time can make epidemics predictable, and
              potentially more easily controlled.
