Abstract    :
              Rice is fast becoming a model organism for plant biology and cereal research in
              particular. The driving force for this is the availability of the genome
              sequence for rice and the high degree of collinearity between rice and other
              cereals including maize, wheat, barley, and sorghum. For rice to be fully
              developed into a robust model species, researchers need access to reagents such
              as genetic stocks and molecular reagents to perform research on rice.
              Currently, there is no established resource center for rice in the United
              States. 

A workshop will be held at the Town and Country Resort, San Diego,
              CA, on January 10, 2003, to discuss the need and attributes of a US based rice
              resource center. Twenty relevant rice and cereal biologists from throughout the
              US and the world, as well as database and stock center managers for other model
              organisms, are included to provide a critical mass of scientists to develop a
              plan for a proposed US resource center. A workshop report will be prepared and
              disseminated to the broader scientific community through plant databases such
              as Gramene and through journal publication. The report will include information
              on how to provide feedback as well as plans for follow-up activities.
