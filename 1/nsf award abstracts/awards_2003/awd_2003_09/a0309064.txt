Abstract

Much of the
              world's deep ocean water acquires its chemical and physical characteristics in
              the northern North Atlantic and adjacent regions.  Surface water sinks in the
              North Atlantic and flows southward to mix with other sources of deep water in
              what is known as the global conveyor belt. This deep water flow erodes sediment
              and ultimately deposits it in large drift deposits. These deposits record the
              history of deep water formation, which in large part reflects changes in the
              earth's climate.

The present project will undertake a detailed study of the
              seismic architecture of two large drift deposits in the North Atlantic.
              Specific aspects of the project are to obtain seismic reflection data with
              which  to interpret the early history of drift formation and to examine modern
              processes that shape and modify the drift deposits. These data will provide
              critical new information on these drifts and will also be used in planning
              future drilling to sample drift sediments directly. This is a cooperative study
              involving  investigators at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Rutgers
              University, and Middlebury College.  Field data will be acquired on a cruise of
              the RV Knorr in mid-2002.
