Abstract    :
              Information resides in many different locations and in many different formats,
              but there is a need to collect an aggregate this information.  An important
              unsolved problem remains:  How to aggregate the information when the query
              rules are poorly understood, informally state, changing quickly, or when there
              is a need for selective revelation of sensitive information.  This project will
              explore the possibility of using ideas and algorithms from the immune system to
              address database issues such as this adaptive query problem. A framework for
              anomaly-detection has been developed and anew connection found that
              demonstrates the formal equivalence of the computations in this framework to
              lossless joins in relational databases.  This offers the possibility that a
              database query system can be built to have immune-based properties of
              distributivity, adaptability and flexibility.  The approach proposed here is
              radical and somewhat speculative, but if successful, could help database
              technology meet the challenges of distributed system.  It will also extend the
              bridge between biology and computation.  The work will involve a designated
              minority institution.
