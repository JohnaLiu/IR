Abstract    :
              	  Many tropical plants have specialized structures in which ants establish
              colonies, in return for which ants protect the plant from herbivores or
              competition.  Short term effects of forest fragmentation include the
              elimination of ants from impacted landscapes, followed by defoliation of
              host-plants.  This research would investigate various mechanisms by which
              forest fragmentation affect ant-plant mutualisms.  Fieldwork would be conducted
              in  The Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (Brazil), the only
              large-scale , experimental landscape designed to study the effects of
              framentation in a tropical rainforest.
	Besides helping to advance the career
              of a minority scientist, the research would contribute to our understanding of
              how landscape alterations change inter-specific dynamics, a better
              understanding of which would improve our ability to design refuges that
              conserve and protect species of concern.
