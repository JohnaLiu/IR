Abstract    :
              The PI proposes a workshop to develop an educational research agenda with Japan
              and US specifically in the areas of Math, Science and Technology education. 
              She proposes to bring leading researchers in mathematics, science and
              technology education together from the two countries a fruitful cross-national
              research agenda.  This agenda would then be published and disseminated in the
              workshop proceedings.  The PI requests funds for hosting this workshop in the
              US.
