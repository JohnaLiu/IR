Abstract    :
              Within fold-thrust belts (FTBs), folds that form under shallow crustal
              conditions (i.e. elastico-frictional regime) initiate primarily by either
              buckling or bending mechanisms.  Theoretical and analog modeling as well as
              some limited field-based data sets on folding mechanisms under shallow-crustal
              conditions leave us with two critical unanswered questions:  What are the
              limits (e.g. interlimb angle, bed thickness, strain rate) to buckling and
              bending?  Beyond initial folding, do 'buckle' and 'bend' folds continue to
              tighten in their own unique ways or, at a certain stage, are their folding
              mechanisms indistinguishable?  Surely, folding is much more complex than most
              models predict; studying natural fold examples provides a more complete picture
              to folding histories.  The P.I. proposes to better understand folding processes
              using natural fold examples in the Anti-Atlas FTB (Morocco), which is primarily
              composed of buckle and bending folds that formed within the elastico-frictional
              (EF) regime.  Unique strain patterns associated with each fold type are
              accommodated by fracture networks and large-scale cataclastic flow within the
              EF regime.  These fractures will be examined to unravel the strain histories,
              and therefore, folding mechanisms.
