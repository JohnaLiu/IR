Abstract    :
              Deep submergence technology has a long history with many individuals and groups
              at numerous US institutions playing key roles in its development since the
              1950's. The construction of Alvin for US Navy, strategic interests, in the
              early 1960s, and its eventual integration into US oceanographic facilities in
              the mid 1970s, ushered in an era where scientists could routinely propose to do
              basic research and conduct experiments in situ on the seafloor.

In the early
              1990's, remotely operated vehicle (ROV) technology and capabilities were
              introduced. ROVs used in the academic community include ROV Jason  and the Argo
              II and DSL-120 sonar mapping systems, creating a national deep submergence
              capability with access to depths as great as 6000m. Since the mid-1990s there
              have been several committees, workshops, reports and technical publications
              focusing on the communities perspective on the evolving deep submergence
              technology in ROVs, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and the continuing
              needs for human-occupied vehicles (HOVs) for basic research in the deep ocean
              and seafloor.  

NSF's Ocean Sciences Division (OCE) is interested in
              assisting the ocean sciences community as much as possible in the quest for the
              right mix of deep submergence vehicles. To accomplish this, OCE has requested
              an Ocean Studies Board study to: 1). assess the continued role of human
              occupied vehicles in deep submergence science, within the context of current
              and projected capabilities of remotely operated and autonomous vehicles,
              telepresence, seafloor observatories, and other non-human occupied
              technologies; 2). make recommendations regarding the mix of new facilities
              needed to continue to carry out world-class deep submergence science; and 3).
              discuss innovative design concepts and technological advances that should be
              incorporated into any new submersibles to support current and future research
              needs.
