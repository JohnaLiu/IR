Abstract    :
              

The objectives of the proposed NSF Summer Institute on Nano Mechanics and
              Materials are: 

1) to offer training on the fundamentals of nano mechanics
              and materials for graduate students, practicing scientists, engineers, and
              professors;

2) to provide networking opportunities for researchers and
              leaders in the field.

 

Lead instructors are known for their research and
              teaching excellence.  Together with networking opportunities, the proposed
              Institute will provide a training opportunity for participants in an important
              area of technology that is not available at this time.  These courses will help
              those in the basic sciences to understand how nanosciences may impact
              marketplace products. Hence, the proposed Institute will significantly impact
              education, research and technology. The broader impact will be the multiplying
              effect of this training.  Participants may launch their own initiatives in
              nanotechnology, such as curriculum development or enhancement, initiation of
              new research ideas, and products.
